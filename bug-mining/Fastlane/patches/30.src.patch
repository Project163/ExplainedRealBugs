-## Alternative location to store device_frames
-
-Device frames can also be stored in a ```./fastlane/screenshots/devices_frames``` directory if you prefer rather than in the ```~/.frameit/device_frames``` directory. If doing so please be aware that Apple's images are copyrighted and should not be redistributed as part of a repository so you may want to include them in your .gitignore file.
-
-## White background of frames
-
-Some stock images provided by Apple still have a white background instead of a transparent one. You'll have to edit the Photoshop file to remove the white background, delete the generated `.png` file and run `fastlane frameit` again.
