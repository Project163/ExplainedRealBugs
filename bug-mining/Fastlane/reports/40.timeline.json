@JosephDuffy Thanks for looking into this. This never worked for me properly even on XCode 12. I remember seeing some correct screenshots at some point though. I wonder if the older XCode/Fastlane didn't completely shut down the Simulator before? Currently, all open Simulators quit when Fastlane starts.\n\nThe command fails on Xcode 12.5.1 too so I think you're right and this was working because the simulators were shutdown fully and  the command has been silently failing since some update of Xcode (maybe always?).\n\nThe PR I made fixed the issue for me, hopefully it can be merged and we can get the right status bars again
