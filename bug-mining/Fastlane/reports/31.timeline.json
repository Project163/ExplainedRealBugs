The docs look better that way, but this kind of works against having `self.example_code` as an array that automatically wraps each example as formatted ruby code. Also I could not find any other action where there was plain text above the code examples. And lastly, using this method it is not possible to have plain text before the first example.\r\n\r\nI think we should stick to having text inside code examples as comments or otherwise the existing structure of `self.example_code` should be reworked so that it is the same for all actions.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/comments/513557059/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FinnGu","id":10939247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTM5MjQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10939247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FinnGu","html_url":"https://github.com/FinnGu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FinnGu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FinnGu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FinnGu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FinnGu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FinnGu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FinnGu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FinnGu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FinnGu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FinnGu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/comments/513811669","html_url":"https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/15053#issuecomment-513811669","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/15053","id":513811669,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMzgxMTY2OQ==","user":{"login":"rnkhouse","id":3238963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3238963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnkhouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rnkhouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnkhouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnkhouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnkhouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnkhouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnkhouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnkhouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnkhouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnkhouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rnkhouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-22T14:19:46Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T14:20:51Z","body":"So, I changed it with `bundle`:\r\n\r\n    lane :playstore do\r\n      gradle(task: \"clean\")\r\n      gradle(\r\n        task: 'bundle',\r\n        build_type: 'Release',\r\n        properties: {\r\n          \"android.injected.signing.store.file\" => \"Keystore.jks\",\r\n          \"android.injected.signing.store.password\" => \"abc\",\r\n          \"android.injected.signing.key.alias\" => \"abc\",\r\n          \"android.injected.signing.key.password\" => \"abc\"\r\n        }\r\n      )\r\n      upload_to_play_store(track: 'alpha')\r\n    end\r\n\r\nBuild is successful.
