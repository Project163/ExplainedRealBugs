Although it doesn't include a way of removing the carrier label, passing a zero-width space seems to give the best result, which can be done in the command like such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--operatorName `echo -ne \"\\u200B\"`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current call to `simctl status_bar` doesn't include that parameter at all, probably because it's only available from Xcode 11.4:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/7e09b711d9efe252edfc9704ffc679bec4a7f4c4/snapshot/lib/snapshot/simulator_launchers/simulator_launcher_base.rb#L123\r\n\r\n##### Command executed\r\n`fastlane snapshot` with `override_status_bar(true)` in Snapfile.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fastlane-bot","id":17056452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDU2NDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17056452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastlane-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/fastlane-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastlane-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastlane-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastlane-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastlane-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastlane-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastlane-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastlane-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastlane-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fastlane-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/17090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/17090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
