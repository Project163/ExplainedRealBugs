New Issue Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Updated fastlane to the latest version\r\n- [x] I read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] I read [docs.fastlane.tools](https://docs.fastlane.tools)\r\n- [x] I searched for [existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues)\r\n\r\n### Issue Description\r\n\r\nWhen using `--readonly` and `--force` at the same time, Match does not think it can match existing profiles despite the matching profiles being logged on the screen. I assume this has to do with the readonly flag blocking Match from generating new profiles and uploading them to the git repo.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to achieve is:\r\n1. Generate profiles using match\r\n2. Modify one of the profiles on the developer portal\r\n3. Run Match in readonly and receive the changes made on the developer portal\r\n\r\nThe reason I need this is because of a requirement for custom entitlements which can only be added to the provisioning profile and not the app ID - There is another ticket open #11049 where we are discussing adding the custom entitlements to profile generation.\r\n\r\nThe only work around that currently works is to manually download the modified profile from the developer portal, encrypt it and push it to the git repo.\r\n\r\n##### Complete output when running fastlane, including the stack trace and command used\r\n```\r\nLukes-iMac:~ luke$ fastlane match development --app_identifier xxx,xxx.today,xxx.watch,xxx.watch.extension --git_url xxx --team_id xxxx --username xxx --force true --readonly true\r\n[✔] 🚀 \r\n[16:53:24]: Get started using a Gemfile for fastlane https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/setup/#use-a-gemfile\r\n\r\n+-----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                               Summary for match 2.74.0                                |\r\n+-----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n| app_identifier        | [\"xxx\", \"xxx.today\",  |\r\n|                       | \"xxx.watch\",                              |\r\n|                       | \"xxx.watch.extension\"]                    |\r\n| git_url               | xxx       |\r\n| team_id               | xxx                                                    |\r\n| username              | xxx                                             |\r\n| force                 | true                                                          |\r\n| readonly              | true                                                          |\r\n| type                  | development                                                   |\r\n| git_branch            | master                                                        |\r\n| keychain_name         | login.keychain                                                |\r\n| verbose               | false                                                         |\r\n| skip_confirmation     | false                                                         |\r\n| shallow_clone         | false                                                         |\r\n| clone_branch_directly | false                                                         |\r\n| force_for_new_devices | false                                                         |\r\n| skip_docs             | false                                                         |\r\n| platform              | ios                                                           |\r\n+-----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n[16:53:24]: Cloning remote git repo...\r\n[16:53:24]: If cloning the repo takes too long, you can use the `clone_branch_directly` option in match.\r\n[16:53:28]: 🔓  Successfully decrypted certificates repo\r\n[16:53:28]: Installing certificate...\r\n\r\n+-------------------+--------------------------------------------+\r\n|                     Installed Certificate                      |\r\n+-------------------+--------------------------------------------+\r\n| User ID           | xxx                                 |\r\n| Common Name       | iPhone Developer: xxx |\r\n| Organisation Unit | xxx                                 |\r\n| Organisation      | xxx                           |\r\n| Country           | US                                         |\r\n| Start Datetime    | Jan  8 16:42:20 2018 GMT                   |\r\n| End Datetime      | Jan  8 16:42:20 2019 GMT                   |\r\n+-------------------+--------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n[16:53:28]: No matching provisioning profiles found for 'Development_xxx'\r\n[16:53:28]: A new one cannot be created because you enabled `readonly`\r\n[16:53:28]: Provisioning profiles in your repo for type `development`:\r\n[16:53:28]: - 'Development_com.xxx.mobileprovision'\r\n[16:53:28]: - 'Development_com.xxx.today.mobileprovision'\r\n[16:53:28]: - 'Development_com.xxx.watch.mobileprovision'\r\n[16:53:28]: - 'Development_com.xxx.watch.extension.mobileprovision'\r\n[16:53:28]: If you are certain that a profile should exist, double-check the recent changes to your match repository\r\n\r\n[!] No matching provisioning profiles found and can not create a new one because you enabled `readonly`.
