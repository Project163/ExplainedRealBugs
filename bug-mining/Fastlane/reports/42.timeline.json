Before you submit your pull request, please make sure to check the following boxes by putting an x in the [ ] (don't: [x ], [ x], do: [x]) -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] I've run `bundle exec rspec` from the root directory to see all new and existing tests pass\r\n- [x] I've followed the _fastlane_ code style and run `bundle exec rubocop -a` to ensure the code style is valid\r\n- [x] I see several green `ci/circleci` builds in the \"All checks have passed\" section of my PR ([connect CircleCI to GitHub](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008097173-Why-aren-t-pull-requests-triggering-jobs-on-my-organization-) if not)\r\n- [x] I've read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] I've updated the documentation if necessary.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n<!-- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->\r\nWhen installing missing Apple WWDR certificates, it seems to also install certificates that are past their expiry date.\r\nAs an extra precaution, this MR adds a check to see If a certificate is valid, before installing it.\r\n\r\nResolves #21269\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe installation logic is divided into three functions:\r\n\r\n- Fetching\r\n- Checking validity\r\n- Installing\r\n\r\nThe new `check_expiry` function uses `security verify-cert` the check if the given certificate has expired.\r\n\r\nThe specs have been updated, and I added an invalid and a valid certificate as fixtures. The valid certificate has an expiry date in 2036, so it shouldn't need to be replaced in the tests anytime soon 😅","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/21273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/21273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/comments/1545610451","html_url":"https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/21269#issuecomment-1545610451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/21269","id":1545610451,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAaK_F85cICTT","user":{"login":"iOSGeekster","id":472491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/472491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iOSGeekster","html_url":"https://github.com/iOSGeekster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iOSGeekster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iOSGeekster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iOSGeekster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iOSGeekster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iOSGeekster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iOSGeekster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iOSGeekster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iOSGeekster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iOSGeekster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-12T11:41:06Z","updated_at":"2023-05-12T11:41:06Z","body":"I've added an PR with a check.
