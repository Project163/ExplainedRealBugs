New Issue Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Updated fastlane to the latest version\r\n- [x] I read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] I read [docs.fastlane.tools](https://docs.fastlane.tools)\r\n- [x] I searched for [existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues)\r\n\r\n### Issue Description\r\n\r\nWhen initializing Fastlane.swift and adding a `buildApp` step with the `includeBitcode` option the following error is raised:\r\n> Generic enum 'OptionalConfigValue' requires the types 'Bool?' and 'Bool' be equivalent\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nclass Fastfile: LaneFile {\r\n\tfunc buildLane() {\r\n\t\tbuildApp(workspace: \"DemoApp.xcodeproj\",\r\n                                 scheme: \"DemoApp\",\r\n                                 includeBitcode: true)\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Command executed\r\n\r\n- `fastlane init swift`\r\n- Remove FastlaneRunner from the `Copy Files` phase as described in [#20104](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/20104)\r\n\r\n##### Complete output when running fastlane, including the stack trace and command used \r\n<!-- \r\nYou can use `--capture_output` as the last command line argument for many commands to get that collected for you. Otherwise, please do it manually.\r\nCaution: The output of `--capture_output` could contain sensitive data such as application ids, certificate ids, or email addresses. Please make sure you double check the output and replace anything sensitive you don't wish to submit in the issue \r\n-->\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <pre>\r\n[✔] 🚀\r\n[13:02:24]: fastlane detected a Gemfile in the current directory\r\n[13:02:24]: However, it seems like you didn't use `bundle exec`\r\n[13:02:24]: To launch fastlane faster, please use\r\n[13:02:24]:\r\n[13:02:24]: $ bundle exec fastlane build --capture_output\r\n[13:02:24]:\r\n[13:02:24]: Get started using a Gemfile for fastlane https://docs.fastlane.tools/getting-started/ios/setup/#use-a-gemfile\r\nDEBUG [2022-04-03 13:02:25.11]: Checking if there are any plugins that should be loaded...\r\nobjc[21581]: Class AppleTypeCRetimerRestoreInfoHelper is implemented in both /usr/lib/libauthinstall.dylib (0x1eab09eb0) and /Library/Apple/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MobileDevice.framework/Versions/A/MobileDevice (0x1054884f8).

exactly the same thing, the only difference being their name. I was able to get my fastlane scripts to run by deleting either one of the phases, which of course makes fastlane complain that it's not up to date. I would assume this is a bug in the implement of `FastlaneRunner` but I would be curious to get context from the implementer as to why there's two copy phases in the Xcode project.\r\n\r\nSame problem, deleting one of the files above solved it but I guess that when I do the upgrade again it will come back...","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/comments/1443646819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"afern247","id":34192856,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTkyODU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34192856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afern247","html_url":"https://github.com/afern247","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afern247/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afern247/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afern247/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afern247/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afern247/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afern247/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afern247/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afern247/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afern247/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/comments/1573463933","html_url":"https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/20104#issuecomment-1573463933","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/20104","id":1573463933,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAaK_F85dySd9","user":{"login":"ARGAMX","id":11425173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDI1MTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11425173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ARGAMX","html_url":"https://github.com/ARGAMX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ARGAMX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ARGAMX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ARGAMX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ARGAMX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ARGAMX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ARGAMX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ARGAMX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ARGAMX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ARGAMX/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-02T09:53:01Z","updated_at":"2023-06-02T11:24:54Z","body":"Same
