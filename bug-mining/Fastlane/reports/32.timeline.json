There are many ways to confuse any kind of check, like `$LOAD_PATH` modifications which can pre-empt the loading of a RubyGem, or trigger it, depending.\r\n\r\n> Is there a definitive list to use for that check?\r\n\r\nNo. Don't maintain a list of white listed libraries to require. These depend on Ruby version, the OS you're on, the specific configure flags you used to compile Ruby, your Gemfile, etc. (i.e. sometimes rdoc is a stdlib sometimes it's a gem, same for json and more).\r\n\r\nIMO you should not warn for normal require usage. The easy fix here is to disable the warning because it provides no value and only confuses users and actually recommends an action that will _break_, not fix, their setup.\r\n\r\nIf you _really_ need to do this, the only \"reliable\" way would be to either monkeypatch into [RubyGems' `require` implementation](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/a90989f70aa8843d1fac2e35ce83bd8e47cd5328/lib/rubygems/core_ext/kernel_require.rb) or basically reimplement the full lookup semantics for how RubyGems decides whether a path is a gem or just a normal Ruby file. Reliable is in quotes because both of these things will need you to maintain compatibility across RubyGems versions, Ruby version, and it's quite a bit of work and _will_ break over time.\r\n\r\nSo you really shouldn't.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/comments/523583775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lsegal","id":686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal","html_url":"https://github.com/lsegal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/comments/523641884","html_url":"https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/15211#issuecomment-523641884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/15211","id":523641884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMzY0MTg4NA==","user":{"login":"janpio","id":183673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzY3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/183673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio","html_url":"https://github.com/janpio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janpio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-21T20:45:23Z","updated_at":"2019-08-21T20:45:23Z","body":"I

I'm all for doing the work if the fastlane team doesn't want to, but if y'all are also setting restrictions on how this is resolved it would be useful to know what those are up front-- again my

Thanks for contributing to _fastlane_! Before you submit your pull request, please make sure to check the following boxes by putting an x in the [ ] (don't: [x ], [ x], do: [x]) -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] I've run `bundle exec rspec` from the root directory to see all new and existing tests pass\r\n- [x] I've followed the _fastlane_ code style and run `bundle exec rubocop -a` to ensure the code style is valid\r\n- [x] I've read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [ ] I've updated the documentation if necessary.\r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nSee #15211 for issue details\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nPrior to warning the user about a missing gem (with installation guide), attempt to require the library. This avoids issues where the library being required is not actually a gem but a local Ruby file or gem provided by Ruby's stdlib.\r\n\r\nTested with RSpec with new tests & fixtures added.\r\n\r\n### Testing Steps\r\n\r\n1. `bundle exec rspec`\r\n\r\nYou can also test manually by using something like `require 'base64'` inside of a Fastfile and expecting no warning. You should still see a warning with any gem that is not installed on your system (i.e. anything that will lead to a LoadError).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/15354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/15354/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/comments/533843834","html_url":"https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/15211#issuecomment-533843834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/15211","id":533843834,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzg0MzgzNA==","user":{"login":"lsegal","id":686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal","html_url":"https://github.com/lsegal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lsegal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-22T02:12:06Z","updated_at":"2019-09-22T02:12:06Z","body":"PR
