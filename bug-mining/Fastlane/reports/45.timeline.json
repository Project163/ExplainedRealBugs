new implementation is that if you don't provide a `release_status:` explicitly, before it didn't try to change its value when doing the API call, while now it will include that parameter in the Google Api call… and because it happens that the default value for `release_status:` is `completed`, this results in the error you're seeing.\n\nI'll take note to work on a PR to fix the issue long term for an upcoming version, but @GiebelGobbler is right that passing `release_status: 'inProgress'` explicitly should solve the issue in the meantime.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/comments/2696681528/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AliSoftware","id":216089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjA4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware","html_url":"https://github.com/AliSoftware","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16551542682,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAaK_F86i3eCqzwAAAAPajH-a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/events/16551542682","actor":{"login":"GiebelGobbler","id":199743586,"node_id":"U_kgDOC-fYYg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199743586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler","html_url":"https://github.com/GiebelGobbler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-04T08:52:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16551542698,"node_id":"SE_lADOAaK_F86i3eCqzwAAAAPajH-q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/events/16551542698","actor":{"login":"GiebelGobbler","id":199743586,"node_id":"U_kgDOC-fYYg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/199743586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler","html_url":"https://github.com/GiebelGobbler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiebelGobbler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-04T08:52:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16551549394,"node_id":"AE_lADOAaK_F86i3eCqzwAAAAPajJnS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/events/16551549394","actor":{"login":"AliSoftware","id":216089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjA4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware","html_url":"https://github.com/AliSoftware","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AliSoftware/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-04T08:

Motivation and Context\r\n\r\nAfter I introduced [this change](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/pull/28960/files#diff-97356a4e0e18355c574a489a006bb0caccb0bfe74f62a6fca7fbce037b4f67a2R138-R142) to _supply_ in `2.226.0`, this broke the behavior for some users in https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/28995.\r\n\r\nThis is because when they provided a `rollout:` parameter with an <1.0 value, but didn't provide an explicit `release_status:` parameter (and it thus defaulted to `'completed'`), the new implementation made the API call with `release_status: 'completed', user_fraction: rollout` instead of using `inProgress` implicitly for rollout values <1.0\r\n\r\n<details><summary>The before/after and history of past implementations</summary>\r\nBefore https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/28995, it was ok to not change the `release.status` of the existing track and status that was fetched by the API to be modified by `#update_rollout`, because before that PR we only fetched releases that were in `inProgress` state, so we were guaranteed that the `status` property of those `release` objects we got back already had the `release.status = 'inProgress'`, and all the old implementation was doing was thus to update that `release.status` to `'completed'` only if a value of `rollout: '1.0'` was provided, leaving the value unchanged to `'inProgress'` otherwise.\r\n\r\nBut after https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues/28995 landed, the `release` objects we got back from the API could be either `inProgress` or `draft`. This is why that part of the implementation / logic was changed to make sure the provided value for the `release_status` parameter was applied, so that it could be changed from `draft` to `inProgress` and vice-versa too if that's what the caller explicitly asked. But that implementation failed to account for the fact that the `release_status` parameter (`ConfigItem`) of _supply_ had a default value of `'completed'` which means that if the user didn't provide a `release_status` parameter explicitly, the new code would attempt to set it to `'completed'` even if `rollout:` was provided with a <1.0 value.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis new implementation was written by writing the Unit Tests (rspecs) first, to write down all the possible use cases that we could encounter with regards to combinations of `release_status`/`rollout` parameter pairs and write down the expectation we have for each of those cases. Then I adjusted the implementation to make sure those tests passed (TDD FTW!)\r\n\r\nHere's the various use cases covered by the unit tests and the behavior we implemented:\r\n\r\n| `rollout` parameter | `release_status` parameter | `user_fraction` sent to API[^1] | `release.status` sent to API |\r\n|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\r\n| `nil` | `DRAFT` | `nil` | `DRAFT` |\r\n| `nil` | `IN_PROGRESS` | - | Error: \"You need to provide a rollout value when release_status is set to 'inProgress'\" |\r\n| `nil` | `COMPLETED` | `nil` | `COMPLETED` |\r\n| `0.5` | `DRAFT` | `nil`[^1] | `DRAFT` |\r\n| `0.5` | `IN_PROGRESS` | `0.5` | `IN_PROGRESS` |\r\n| `0.5` | `COMPLETED` | `0.5` | `IN_PROGRESS`[^2] |\r\n| `1.0` | `DRAFT` | `nil`[^1] | `DRAFT` |\r\n| `1.0` | `IN_PROGRESS` | `nil`[^1] | `COMPLETED`[^3] |\r\n| `1.0` | `COMPLETED` | `nil`[^1] | `COMPLETED` |\r\n\r\n[^1]: [The `user_fraction` parameter is only expected by the API if `status` is `inProgress` or `halted`](https://googleapis.dev/ruby/google-api-client/latest/Google/Apis/AndroidpublisherV3/TrackRelease.html#user_fraction-instance_method)\r\n[^2]: We intentionally force the status sent to the API to be `'inProgress'` even if the user called the action with `'completed'`, because the `rollout` parameter was explicitly passed with value `1.0`\r\n[^3]: We intentionally force the status sent to the API to be `'completed'` even if the user called the action with `'inProgress'`, because the `rollout` parameter was explicitly passed but with a value <1.0\r\n\r\n### Testing Steps\r\n\r\n - Point your `Gemfile` to the branch of this PR\r\n - Call `upload_to_play_store` in your `Fastfile` with the usual parameters you'd call it with, but testing the different use cases provided in the table above for `rollout` and `release_status`\r\n\r\nIn particular, it'd be nice if some of you could test those calls while your tracks in Google Play are in different states, like the track already containing a release but being in draft, or a track containing a release which has started rollout but not at 100% yet, multiple releases in draft in the same track, …\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncc @Noorrama
