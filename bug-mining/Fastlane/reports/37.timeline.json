Thanks for helping fastlane! Before you submit your issue, please make sure you followed our checklist and check the appropriate boxes by putting an x in the [ ]: [x] -->\r\n\r\n### New Issue Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Updated fastlane to the latest version\r\n- [x] I read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- [x] I read [docs.fastlane.tools](https://docs.fastlane.tools)\r\n- [x] I searched for [existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/issues)\r\n\r\n### Issue Description\r\n<!-- Please include what's happening, expected behavior, and any relevant code samples -->\r\n\r\nI'm seeing some weird behaviour when trying to create new iOS provisioning profiles. I have to login an additional time after calling `Spaceship::Portal.provisioning_profile.all` and before calling `Spaceship::Portal.provisioning_profile.app_store.create!` or I'll get a \"Bad Request\" error.\r\n\r\nSo, in below `Fastfile` having this in the `create_profile_test` lane will fail:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  spaceship_portal_login(username, password, team_id)\r\n  existing_profiles = Spaceship::Portal.provisioning_profile.all\r\n  certificate = Spaceship::Portal.certificate.all.find {|cert| cert.id === cert_id}\r\n  create_provisioning_profile(app_identifier, provisioning_name, certificate)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this will succeed (added an additional login call after fetching provisioning profiles):\r\n\r\n```\r\n  spaceship_portal_login(username, password, team_id)\r\n  existing_profiles = Spaceship::Portal.provisioning_profile.all\r\n  spaceship_portal_login(username, password, team_id)                           # Added\r\n  certificate = Spaceship::Portal.certificate.all.find {|cert| cert.id === cert_id}\r\n  create_provisioning_profile(app_identifier, provisioning_name, certificate)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this will also succeed (removed fetching provisioning profiles):\r\n\r\n```\r\n  spaceship_portal_login(username, password, team_id)\r\n  # existing_profiles = Spaceship::Portal.provisioning_profile.all              # Removed\r\n
