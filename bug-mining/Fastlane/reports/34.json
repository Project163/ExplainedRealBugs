We are trying to use ODR's though and when we try to resign their IPA via *sigh*, the ODR's are not signed/resigned.\r\n\r\n#### Feature Description\r\n\r\nIf an IPA is resigned and the IPA contains an OnDemandResources folder within the Payload folder, resign the assetpack within the ODR as well.\r\n\r\n#### Alternatives or Workarounds\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we have to write a plugin that simulates much of what resign.sh does ( unzip, get the keychain, sign, etc ).","closed_by":{"login":"joshdholtz","id":401294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTI5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/401294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdholtz","html_url":"https://github.com/joshdholtz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdholtz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdholtz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdholtz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdholtz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdholtz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdholtz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdholtz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdholtz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshdholtz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/16668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fastlane/fastlane/issues/16668/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
