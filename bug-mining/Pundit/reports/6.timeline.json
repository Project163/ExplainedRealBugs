We tend to avoid that, but in this case we actually don't load the resources themselves but just their count, and the line itself reads quite nicely. And as it is ran based on layout and on nearly all, but not, I don't know where would be a better place to initialize an instance variable for it. Certainly not `ApplicationController`.\n\n> Have you considered loading the data needed to do rendering from the controller, or controller helper of some sort?\n\nYes, we have, but it wouldn't actually help this issue at all. The main painpoint is that we get a false sense of security when using the `verify_policy_scoped` function in all of our controllers, as it never raises an error due to `policy_scope` being used in some \"helper-ish\" place.\n\n> If this is some kind of composite page where data being pulled is not exclusive related to the resource rendered, then perhaps a module (or method on application controller if appropriate) that let's the controller just load it's thing might help.\n\nThat's good advice, thanks! This really does seem to belong more to the controller side, but as the size calculation need is layout-based, it might get a bit confusing.\n\nAll of the points you gave, however, won't help me in remedying this issue, which mainly points to `verify_policy_scoped` always setting the flag, never caring about what it is feeded in. We always have a need to load at least one scope besides the scope that is loaded in the `index` action of a particular collection, so we are never able to get the benefits of the `verify_policy_scoped`.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/comments/55252856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"valscion","id":482561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjU2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/482561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion","html_url":"https://github.com/valscion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":164163331,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTY0MTYzMzMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/events/164163331","actor":{"login":"jeffdeville","id":131664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffdeville","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-09-11T11:48:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":164163332,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2NDE2MzMzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/events/164163332","actor":{"login":"jeffdeville","id":131664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffdeville","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-09-11T11:48:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/comments/55432603","html_url":"https://github.com/varvet/pundit/issues/207#issuecomment-55432603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/207","id":55432603,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDMyNjAz","user":{"login":"jeffdeville","id":131664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffdeville","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffdeville/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-1

It just requires too much effort to remember to test each and every one controller action if they haven't been written with TDD in the first place, and even then some code paths might slip past those tests. It should never hurt to have the last line of defense in the shape of automatic error reporting in place.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/comments/70627751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"valscion","id":482561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjU2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/482561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion","html_url":"https://github.com/valscion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valscion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/comments/86927045","html_url":"https://github.com/varvet/pundit/issues/207#issuecomment-86927045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/207","id":86927045,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2OTI3MDQ1","user":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-27T12:29:42Z","updated_at":"2015-03-27T12:29:42Z","body":"Hmm, this is tricky. I don't actually know what a good solution to this would be. I think the way you're using `policy_scope` is legitimate. I think the only way this is fixable is not exposing `policy_scope` as a `helper_method`, and instead having a separate helper which exposes a different `policy_scope` method which does not set the flag. That's somewhat cumbersome, but it's as close as we can get, I think.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/comments/86927045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-27T12:51:40Z","updated_at":"2015-03-27T12:51:40Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/262","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/262/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/262/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/262/events","html_url":"https://github.com/varvet/pundit/pull/262","id":64756672,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzIxMDQ2MDM=","number":262,"title":"Don't
