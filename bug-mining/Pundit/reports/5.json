Since spec_helper.rb doesn't require \"active_support\" to setup autoloading, or \"active_support/deprecation\" directly, this causes the call to `capture` to [fail](https://travis-ci.org/elabs/pundit/jobs/51556714).  \n\nAdding `require \"active_support\"` or `require \"active_support/deprecation\"` fixes the problem, but since `capture` is deprecated, I was wondering how to best update the code in `spec_helper` so RSpec's deprecation warnings are caught without using the deprecated `capture`.  Any thoughts on borrowing the implementation of `Kernel#capture` into `spec_helper`?  `capture` was deprecated because it isn't thread-safe.  In the context where it's used in spec_helper.rb, this doesn't seem to be an issue.  \n","closed_by":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/varvet/pundit/issues/252/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
