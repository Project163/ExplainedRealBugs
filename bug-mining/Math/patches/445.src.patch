+        The cutOff mechanism of the "SimplexSolver" in package o.a.c.math3.optim.linear
+        could lead to invalid solutions. The mechanism has been improved in a way that
+        the tableau does not need to be updated anymore. Additionally, a new check will
+        prevent impossible solutions to be returned as valid.

         Improved performance of "SimplexSolver" in package o.a.c.math3.optim.linear by
