            <title>[MATH-1197] Incorrect Kolmogorov&#8211;Smirnov Statistic for two samples </title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MATH-1197</link>
                <project id="12310485" key="MATH">Commons Math</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;kolmogorovSmirnovTest(double[],double[]) against the samples given below gives 5.699107852308316E-12 instead of 0.9793 (approx.) Traced the issue to kolmogorovSmirnovStatistic(double[],double[]) which gives 0.49507389162561577 instead of 0.064 (verified with ks.test in R and JDistlib)&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="14283756" author="tn" created="Tue, 20 Jan 2015 12:08:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;One observation: the samples contain a lot of equal values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The KS test statistic is implemented using Arrays.binarySearch, but this does not specify which index will be found when looking for a given value in a sorted array.&lt;br/&gt;
E.g. if you have samples &lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; and you search for 0, you might get an index in the range &lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;0, 4&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;. As far as I understand the KS statistic, it is an empirical distribution function which calculates the cumulative density based on how many values are less or equal than the given observation, which is not equal to the result returned by Arrays.binarySearch.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14284003" author="psteitz" created="Tue, 20 Jan 2015 16:49:38 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is a bug.  Arrays.binarySearch should not have been used here.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14284366" author="tn" created="Tue, 20 Jan 2015 20:37:17 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The attached patch fixes the two-sample KS test statistic calculation.&lt;br/&gt;
Actually, I did not fully understand the way it was calculated before, but I followed now the formula from the wiki page and it results in the correct result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fixing this issue, another problem popped up in test testTwoSampleProductSizeOverflow which relates to a TODO in the ksSum method.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14284500" author="tn" created="Tue, 20 Jan 2015 22:07:50 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The exactP method also seems to have a problem when comparing it with the results from R.&lt;br/&gt;
Take this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;[] x = &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;[] { 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 };
        &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;[] y = &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;[] { 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 };
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; KolmogorovSmirnovTest test = &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; KolmogorovSmirnovTest();
        &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;p=&quot;&lt;/span&gt; + test.kolmogorovSmirnovTest(x, y, &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;));
        &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;D=&quot;&lt;/span&gt; + test.kolmogorovSmirnovStatistic(x, y));
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;approximateP=&quot;&lt;/span&gt; + test.approximateP(test.kolmogorovSmirnovStatistic(x, y), x.length, y.length));
        &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;exactP=&quot;&lt;/span&gt; + test.exactP(test.kolmogorovSmirnovStatistic(x, y), x.length, y.length, &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;));
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;returns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;preformatted panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;preformattedContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;p=0.35714285714285715
D=0.46666666666666673
approximateP=0.5925028311389975
exactP=0.4155844155844156
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R computes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;preformatted panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;preformattedContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;data:  x and y
D = 0.4667, p-value = 0.5925
alternative hypothesis: two-sided
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: the reason seems to be that R can not compute exactP values in case of ties.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14284576" author="psteitz" created="Tue, 20 Jan 2015 22:51:27 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Assuming whatever bugs in the D computation have been fixed, our exactP should actually be &quot;exact.&quot;  I could not make sense of, or find documentation for, what R does for small samples.  Our code computes the exact distribution of the associated D statistic.  I suspect that R does some kind of approximation.  As you said, R I think also disallows ties.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
