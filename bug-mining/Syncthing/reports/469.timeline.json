of all, I should say, please keep up the great work!\n\nSo this is just a thought... why not use [semver](http://semver.org/) for versioning and bump the major release number for each major update instead of the minor version number?  Node.js fell into this strange pattern of keeping everything 0.x.x for the longest time.  Then, they suddenly decided one day that it was \"1.x worthy\", and the version numbers quickly moved to 4.x, 5.x and beyond.  What's the point of the major release number if it always stays at 0?  When is a project \"1.0 worthy\"?  When it's bug-free?  Hint: nothing is ever bug-free.  :)\n\nIMHO, Syncthing has been 1.x worthy for a while now...\n\nBump major version number for breaking changes (i.e. version 2.x won't work with 1.x)\nBump minor version number for significant, non-breaking, backwards-compatible changes\nBump revision version number for bug fixes or very minor changes\n\nIn this way, you can always safely auto-upgrade to the latest minor release, which is currently not the case with Syncthing (version 0.13 does not work with 0.12)\n\nThoughts?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/221899127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bminer","id":73755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bminer","html_url":"https://github.com/bminer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bminer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bminer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bminer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bminer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bminer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bminer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bminer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bminer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bminer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/221901550","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3163#issuecomment-221901550","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3163","id":221901550,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTkwMTU1MA==","user":{"login":"canton7","id":568104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODEwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7","html_url":"https://github.com/canton7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-26T15:16:25Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T15:16:25Z","body":"The forum is probably a better place for this discussion.\n\n(There was actually a big discussion on this last year, in the contributors section.
