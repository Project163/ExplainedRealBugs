\"panic-20251011-121955.log\" -->\n\nIssue Description:\nWhile processing a directory containing over 100,000 data entries, we encountered persistent out-of-memory (OOM) errors. This issue occurred consistently across multiple environments, including 32-bit and 64-bit VMs, and various software versions (1.29, 1.30, 2.0.10).\n\nKey Observations:\n\nAt the time of failure, the operating system had 7GB of free memory available out of 16GB total.\n\nThe application log indicated that the process was using approximately 1.8GB of memory when it failed to allocate a 4MB block.\n\nInterim Solution & Proposed Enhancements:\nWe have temporarily mitigated the problem by adjusting key configuration parameters. For a more robust long-term solution, we recommend:\n\nFine-tuning the aforementioned parameters.\n\nImplementing an intelligent memory management mechanism, such as automatic memory degradation or other dynamic allocation strategies, to improve system resilience under heavy load.\n\n\n### Fix sulution:\nfile:case fs.go line:20\n\n```\nconst (\n\t// How long to consider cached dirnames valid\n\tcaseCacheTimeout   = 10 * time.Second // Increased from 1 second to 10 seconds to reduce cache churn\n\tcaseCacheItemLimit = 64 << 10 // Increased from 4<<10 (4096) to 64<<10 (65536) to reduce memory pressure\n)\n```\n\n### Syncthing version\n\n2.0.100, 1.29, 1.30, x32 and x64\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nWindows x64\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nfatal error: out of memory\n\nruntime stack:\nruntime.throw({0x7ff7573a3ea8?, 0xc24c550000?})\n\truntime/panic.go:1094 +0x4d fp=0x30d0bff638 sp=0x30d0bff608
