This is often not reachable, since many corporate networks only allow TCP-Traffic on Port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). \n\nPort configurations of firewalls are independent for the different protocols UDP and TCP. So, an open port 80 may be available for TCP connections, but is likely not for UDP.\n\nOther corporate networks use HTTP(s) proxy server, which don't allow non-HTTP related payload and the firewalls filter UDP as well. \n\nIf you use a HTTP GET method, you maximize the chance to pass any firewall, proxy or filter. \n\nAlso, if you want to make syncthing a success, similar to other commercial alternatives you must maximize the ease of use, which includes configuration-less global discovery. \n\nThe use of private discovery servers is only relevant for people with technical interests and special privacy concerns, not for the mass you may want to reach.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/84053903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ckoehnen","id":6333387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzMzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6333387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckoehnen","html_url":"https://github.com/ckoehnen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckoehnen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckoehnen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckoehnen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckoehnen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckoehnen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckoehnen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckoehnen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckoehnen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ckoehnen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/84054472","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/628#issuecomment-84054472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/628","id":84054472,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MDU0NDcy","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-20T15:53:54Z","updated_at":"2015-03-20T15:54:27Z","body":"I can see the use case for when there is an actual firewall that only allows TCP connections out on a certain destination port.
