i don't have a fork, i just have the 2 css files. i build them on browser. I can provide this 2 files, or send to you.\n\n@marclaporte i have revorked the dark theme, with many details, shadows and effects. I would apreciate, if my reworked theme will be added to. It looks uniq for Syncthing, better than the first image i have put on the first comment, on start.\n\nHow can i send here this files? i can just images to attach here on this github editor. Should i put this 2 css files somwhere on my private server, better?\n\n@calmh Yes, it would be great to make an drop-down selector like language, but the best position for this, i think is on the lower right corner, footer, i guess.
