Whichever option is chosen, the changes are applied.\r\n\r\nIf  anything other than `default` the behaviour is the same, but the console also outputs errors:\r\n```\r\nINFO: Listen (BEP/tcp): listen tcp :22000: bind: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted.\r\nINFO: c.S.listenerSupervisor: Failed service 'tcp://:22000' (1.000000 failures of 2.000000), restarting: true, error: \"{tcp://:22000 tcp://:22000} returned unexpectedly\", stacktrace: [unknown stack trace]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSemi-relatedly: if the specification includes an IP address or port that cannot be bound, syncthing is aware of this but it's only reported in the console. Also if the \"tcp://\" prefix is missing, the input is saved but syncthing fails to listen. A GUI warning for these user errors might be helpful.\r\n\r\nAll tested with v1.1.4.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5824/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
