the file system watcher will skip watching ignored directories in trivial cases:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, as soon as there is something \"tricky\" like an exclude pattern, it doesn't:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/foo\r\n!bar\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`/foo` is no longer skipped, because in the mind of the ignore matcher, we might find unignored stuff underneath it...)\r\n\r\nHowever there are a bunch of simple cases like above where we can safely say that anything under `/foo` must be ignored, because any other patterns come later in the file and will never be processed.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9339/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9339/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
