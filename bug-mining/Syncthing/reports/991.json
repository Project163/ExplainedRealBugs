This causes the following awkward output on startup:\r\n\r\n```\r\nStarted Syncthing Discovery Server.\r\nstdiscosrv  (go1.12.9 linux-amd64) @ 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\nStarted Syncthing Relay Server.\r\nmain.go:149: strelaysrv  (go1.12.9 linux-amd64) @ 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe builder info is just an @ and the build date is the UNIX timestamp of zero.\r\n\r\nOlder releases (v1.0.1) print correct data here, for example `stdiscosrv v1.0.1 (go1.11.5 linux-amd64) teamcity@build.syncthing.net 2019-01-18 10:34:18 UTC`.\r\n\r\nThe main syncthing binary is also fine and prints everything correctly, for example:\r\n\r\n`syncthing v1.2.2 \"Fermium Flea\" (go1.12.9 windows-amd64) teamcity@build.syncthing.net 2019-08-15 13:51:09 UTC`\r\n\r\nAs far as I've diagnosed the issue apart from the output on startup everything works OK.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked at any other `/cmd` binaries apart from the three mentioned above, so I don't know if other executables are affected.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v1.2.2 (syncthing, discovery, relay)\r\nOS Version: Bug discovered/verified on Linux amd64.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just for the sake of completeness: I forgot to mention that the `version` information is missing too, there's just a whitespace where \"v1.2.2\" should have been.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5993/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
