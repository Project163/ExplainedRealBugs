I updated one client to Syncthing version 2.0.0 and it could no longer connect to my server running version 1.30.0. It showed Disconnected is the server header and no such host for the local address and ports (tcp, quic on IPv4 and IPv6).\n\nOn my other devices running Syncthing 1.30.0 (Windows) or Syncthing 1.30.0.3 (Android) connection remain fine.\n\nAll of my tests are on a local subnet with IPv4 and IPv6 available.\n\nIn my system I use a nonstandard port address for my connections that I specify under Advanced/Addresses when editing the remote device panel on the client. And the remote device specifies \"tcp://host:port, quic://host:port\" for the listen addresses. I don't use any NAT Traversal, Global Discovery, Local Discovery or Relay options (all four options unchecked). I support remote connections with a public domain address, DDNS and port forwards and/or firewall rules.\n\nI can make it work in two ways:\n\n1) Enable Local Discovery on both the client (V2) and server machine, and setting the server address to dynamic in the client machine.\n\n2) Enable Local Discovery on both the client (V2) and server machine, and setting the server address to \"tcp://host:port, quic://host:port, tcp://public-host:port, quic://public-host:port\".\n\nInterestingly, with method (2), I still get a local area network connection from the client to the server.\n\nPlease advise and/or let me know what additional information you need.\n\nThanks.\n\n### Syncthing version\n\nV2.0.0 and V1.30.0\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nWindows 10 client, Windows 11 server\n\n### Browser version\n\nEdge\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\n```","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10251/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
