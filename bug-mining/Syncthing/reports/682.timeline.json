may be related to: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1126\n\nI noticed a minor problem with writing the ignore preferences from the GUI. Even if syncthing has permissions to edit .stignore, the fact that it tries to write to a temporary file first -- e.g., .syncthing.stignore-sharename123456789 -- prevents it from happening, if syncthing doesn't have write permissions for that folder. (I'm trying to set up a read-only share, where syncthing will simply observe the folder for backup purposes, and has limited permissions to that folder, since it doesn't/shouldn't need them.)\n\nI can still edit .stignore just fine with vim. I bring that up because I know vim attempts to write to a backup file first, yet it can still handle writing with no complaints when there's no permission to create a backup file. I don't understand the mechanisms behind that, but it could be a simple exception case.\n\nI can't think of the best solution, since temporary files are used for a good reason... If the syncthing configuration files were confined to their own specific folder, either a subfolder or elsewhere, it would be easier to handle situations like this, but not necessarily elegant...\n\nI left the subject vague, since I don't know if it'd be desirable to extend to other situations, like synchronizing. That seems like it could be a bad idea, to me.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1461/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-15T10:40:12Z","updated_at":"2015-06-15T10:40:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1940","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1940/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1940/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1940/events","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1940","id":88001654,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4ODAwMTY1NA==","number":1940,"title":"need
