I updated to 14.7 through the GUI and the same issue happens (see log file below). I rebooted and downgraded again to 14.6 and everything runs normally. I manually installed 14.7 from CLI and the same issue happens again. I have once again downgraded to 14.6 and will be running 14.6 until the issue can be resolved.
