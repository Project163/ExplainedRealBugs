just spent 10 minutes going back and forth because Syncthing kept spitting \"out of disk space\" errors, which is quite confusing when `df` says otherwise. \r\nTurns out I was just below the quota of 10% set for just that folder. \r\n\r\nI think, something like `Folder quota of X%/kB/MB/GB/TB free space reached` would be more appropriate than `insufficient disk space`, which sounds like the disk is just 100% full.
