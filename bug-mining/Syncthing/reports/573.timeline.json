I've been meaning to test this. Based on what you have written here I suspect they \"Don't receive changes\" from each other.\n\nI use master folders when I'm using Syncthing for backup. In most cases the master syncs to 2 or more backup devices located in different places. I think of the backup folders as \"Archive Folders\" rather than the source folder as a \"Master Folder\". One thing I would find very useful is an option to have normal folders on more than one source device that sync with each other in read/write mode and one or more devices with the folders set as \"Archive Folders\" which get changes from both source devices and never send changes. The downside to this is that multiple Archive devices would not be able to share with each other and keep each other up to date when the source devices are offline.\n\nAs things are I would like to be able to override changes on the Archive devices.
