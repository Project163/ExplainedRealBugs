So the remote here is only aware of the local file infos up to sequence 25.\r\n\r\nLooking at `indexHandler.sendIndexTo` and the lack of any logging, that suggests file infos with sequence >25 are marked as receive-only-changed (L281) or don't exist at all. Sequence numbers being low/out-of-order is checked with debug logging enabled, that would result in a panic.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed on revert we keep that flag when reverting, to avoid sending the index update, see folder_recvenc.go L83+.\r\n\r\nNow comes the part that explains this observation of yours (emphasis mine):\r\n\r\n> 2. On the receiving end, create a file or folder. *Editing a properly synced encrypted file does not seem to trigger this (and overall works as expected)*\r\n\r\nThe revert triggers a scan, and for a real file that exists on a remote, nothing happens on scan. As the revert reset the version, it gets pulled in and everything is up-to-date again.\r\n\r\nFor a locally created file there is no global equivalent. This triggers a special case that removes the file info from the DB (folder.go L607+), and that's where the sequence gets messed up. Stepping back to the beginning:\r\n   \r\n1. After creating the file it is scanned and added to the db -> sequence 26\r\nNothing sent to the remote, as it's locally changed in an encrypted folder.\r\n2. Then it gets removed in the revert -> sequence 27\r\nNot sent, as above.\r\n3. Scan sees that we have a locally changed, deleted entry without any file info from remotes -> removes it from the DB.  \r\nNow the last used sequence is still 27, however the highest sequence of any file in the DB is 25 -> index sender loops forever doing nothing.\r\n\r\nI think the right solution here is in indexhandler.sendIndexTo, if there was nothing to send, set s.prevSequence to fset.Sequence. Any new change will get a higher sequence, so we can't miss anything - there's no point looking at anything `< fset.Sequence` anymore.  \r\nEdit: Actually finding something to check in the test might be nasty, as there's no incorrect external behaviour, just a loop doing nothing. Not sure how to detect that.\r\n\r\nThat's easy to do, writing a test-case is likely going to be a bit of work. Hopefully some testcase from `folder_recvonly_test.go` is easily adaptable.\r\n\r\n@er-pa I won't work on this right now, but will at some point unless you pick it up (very welcome to, you anyway already did the hard work of tracking it down - thanks a lot again!). As in please leave a note here if you do start to work on it.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1937081120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11765320711,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAOCAEs5-slfazwAAAAK9RIwH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/11765320711","actor":{"login":"er-pa","id":43787840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzg3ODQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43787840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa","html_url":"https://github.com/er-pa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-10T17:46:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11765320712,"node_id":"SE_lADOAOCAEs5-slfazwAAAAK9RIwI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/11765320712","actor":{"login":"er-pa","id":43787840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzg3ODQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43787840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa","html_url":"https://github.com/er-pa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/er-pa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-10T17:46:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11765320919,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAOCAEs5-slfazwAAAAK9RIzX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/11765320919","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-10T17:46:53Z","label":{"name":"needs-triage","color":"ce23af"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12066403650,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs5-slfazwAAAALPNrVC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/12066403650","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id"
