This is despite the fact that the global state isn't actually known yet, as the indexes are still being downloaded and processed.\n\nThe issue can be seen in the screenshot below. In reality, in this case, both global and local states are actually equal, and there will be no need to revert any changes once the index exchange is complete.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a1f0a48-2304-4e25-a92c-75c422a08eea)\n\nOn a side note, is there any danger in actually pressing the \"Revert Local Changes\" button in this situation? I have always been afraid to click it not to cause any issues 😅.\n\n### Syncthing version\n\nv2.0.0-rc.21\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nWindows (64-bit Intel/AMD)\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\n```","closed_by":{"login":"tomasz1986","id":5626656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjY2NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5626656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasz1986","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10191/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
