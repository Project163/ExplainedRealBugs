I think there are two problems with the current format.\n\nFirst, I tried to mark the files with the desired extension as included:\n\n```\n!(?)*.jpg\n!(?)*.png\n```\n\nThis already did not work, as it is not possible to use both `!` and `(?)` as a prefix. I tried both `!(?)` and `(?)!`, none seemed to be working.\n\nSecond, I did not find a satisfying way to exclude the rest of the directory structure. Of course, simply\n\n```\n*\n```\n\ndoes not work, as it matches all directories, stopping syncthing from looking inside them. The next best thing is probably\n\n```\n*.*\n```\n\nbut this also excludes directories (and their contents) with a `.` inside. Plus, it does not exclude files without a `.`. What is necessary is a distinction between patterns that match directories and patterns that match files. I think the approach taken by git (http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) is sensible: everything that ends with a `/` matches directories only and everything else matches files only.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","closed_by":{"login":"Zillode","id":14169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode","html_url":"https://github.com/Zillode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
