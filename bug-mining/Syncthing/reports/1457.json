This ignores any `STGUIADDRESS` override given via environment variable or command-line option, thus probing for the default port instead of the one specified via override.\r\n\r\nWhen not probing for free ports (`--skip-port-probing`), the override should still be persisted rather than the default address.  Only when generating a fresh default `config.xml`, never on an existing one.\n\n### Syncthing version\n\n1.28.0\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nLinux amd64\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9783/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9783/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
