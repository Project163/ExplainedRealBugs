I value your assessment AB, and I am completely open to criticism. Sure it probably won't work on expensive corporate networks, but my guess is that most people are using Syncthing on home networks. I personally own a $400 router, and the simple Netcat trick in top post is able to make TCP connection through it. I do part-time IT work, and every home router I've ever tested has been able to make connection with that simple Netcat trick.\r\n\r\nCalmh is correct that there is a trick with TCP, that the timing on both ends need to attempt connect/communication within about 30 seconds of each other. If they don't make it in time, then the source port could be closed for a couple minutes by the router. (Another source port could be used while waiting for the router to reopen the previous port)\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration everything what's been offered here, it seems the best resolution to this issue might be to improve KCP so that it has reliable (TCP-like) functionality. Perhaps a sort of KCP \"ping\" every X seconds, to verify that the connection is still alive. Upon \"ping\" fail, then attempt discovery/reconnect.\r\n\r\nDoes this KCP \"ping\" sound like a good solution? I would be willing to close this issue, and reopen one for KCP improvement, and donate to that issue. In my humble opinion, the goal of reliable NAT2NAT connection is important, but the method to reach that goal should be whatever makes the most sense.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/315640037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Sepero","id":1575546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzU1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1575546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sepero","html_url":"https://github.com/Sepero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sepero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sepero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sepero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sepero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sepero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sepero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sepero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sepero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sepero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/315640510","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4259#issuecomment-315640510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4259","id":315640510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNTY0MDUxMA==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-16T22:03:09Z","updated_at":"2017-07-16T22:03:09Z","body":"Kcp has pings and what not and it should mostly work.
