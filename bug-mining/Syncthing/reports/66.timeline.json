TLDR version: (1) we can't really have two different things called folder in a same context (repositories and directories). (2) We shouldn't push windows-centric-terms into non-windows, because that confuses users who don't come from windows.\n\n\"folder\" sounds too windows-centric, IMHO, since everything is called a folder in windows (eg: directories are folders, mailboxes are folders, etc). It sounds to alienish on Linux, where we have directories, not folders. Directories are only called folders on windows (I've no idea about OS X).\n\nI also think it will be confusing on windows: a folder (repository) will by synced into a folder (directory). For example, if a user says \"Go ahead and delete the folder\", does he mean the \"repository\"? Or the \"directory\"?\nThe term is too ambiguous, and two different meanings are used in the same context, which can only lead to trouble.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/58729819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"WhyNotHugo","id":730811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDgxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo","html_url":"https://github.com/WhyNotHugo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/58737394","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/739#issuecomment-58737394","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/739","id":58737394,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NzM3Mzk0","user":{"login":"Bugsbane","id":401733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTczMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/401733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane","html_url":"https://github.com/Bugsbane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-11T04:07:38Z","updated_at":"2014-10-11T04:12:12Z","body":"I've used Linux exclusively for over a decade.
