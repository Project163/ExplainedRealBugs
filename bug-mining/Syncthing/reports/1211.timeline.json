see why it would be nice in this case, but in general I don't think it's a good idea. Imagine e.g. `--home`: If you have a typo there, Syncthing will start with config and db in the default location, which would work but not be the thing the user wants, i.e. quite confusing. Generally it would do something else than what the user intended it to do.
