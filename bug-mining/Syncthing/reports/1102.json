Please see https://docs.syncthing.net/advanced/folder-copyrangemethod.html for details.\r\n\r\n- adds TCP hole punching, used to establish high performance TCP connections in certain NAT scenarios where only relay or QUIC connections could be used previously.\r\n\r\n- adds a configuration to file versioning for how often to run cleanup. This defaults to once an hour, but is configurable from very frequently to never.","creator":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":71,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-06-16T13:44:35Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T09:10:41Z","due_on":"2020-08-18T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-08-11T09:10:41Z"},"comments":10,"created_at":"2017-07-15T18:32:13Z","updated_at":"2021-06-17T07:02:31Z","closed_at":"2020-06-16T07:17:10Z","author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"Myth-\r\nTwo Nat'd devices can't directly communicate with each other.\r\n\r\nReality-\r\nMost Nat'd devices can directly communicate over TCP or UDP, if given the proper instruction.\r\n\r\nTest Example Run with Netcat:\r\nOn Nat'd System 1\r\n\r\n    pc1$ nc -p 64000 $ip_of_pc2 64000\r\n\r\nOn Nat'd System 2\r\n\r\n    pc2$ nc -p 64000 $ip_of_pc1 64000\r\n\r\nUsing this on most NAT networks, these two NAT'd computers will immediately be able to start communicating 100% directly with each other. (Test it for yourself.) The only thing they require is a discovery service to inform each of them what the others IP address is.\r\n\r\nI'm asking this hole punching technique be implemented in the code of Syncthing (hopefully as a module, so that it can replicated easily in other OSS projects). This should dramatically lighten the load on relay's and boost network transfer speeds.\r\n\r\nIf Jakob (calmh) also believes this would be a good idea to implement, then I will immediately bountysource this for $200. And perhaps others will pitch in as well.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4259/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4259/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
