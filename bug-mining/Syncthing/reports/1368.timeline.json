While investigating, the most likely conclusion I reached was that a file handle not being closed in the Windows file handling code related to temp directories and tests, however I ran out of time before I could pinpoint the exact line of code where the file was being left open when the temp dir cleanup was occurring. For our tests, we worked around the issue by avoiding temp dir creation at all. Based on my findings, no amount of delay or retry is going to resolve this specific Windows issue. \r\n\r\nCaveat, although I've been programming for decades, I'm a newbie with Go.
