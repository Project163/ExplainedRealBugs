However this breaks down in a fairly common scenario of filesystems not properly retaining permissions, for example. Consider:\n\n- Devices A and B are in sync. B has a filesystem with unexpected limitations, like FAT on Linux or something.\n- A file is synced from A to B. This includes setting permissions, which succeeds but is ignored on B.\n- (At this point, permissions are different from expected on B. We don't know that yet, because it wasn't a change that would trigger a fs notification or rescan.)\n- Another change happens to that file, it is synced from A to B.\n- On B, when syncing, Syncthing sees that the metadata isn't what it should be according to the database, aborts the sync and triggers a rescan. Rescan will pick up the new permissions and create a new version.\n- On B, at next sync attempt, we have a conflict. Both the metadata and content are different from the new version of the file, so we need to create a conflict copy of the old file.\n\n### Syncthing version\n\n2.0\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nany\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\n```","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10349/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10349/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
