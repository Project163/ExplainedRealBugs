Share a folder with a lot of files from A to B. I used a folder with 10,000 of 0-byte-sized text files.\r\n2. While still syncing, delete the files on A, and wait for the deletions to sync on B. I actually had to restart the folder on B to get the two in sync.\r\n3. Two folders are reported as \"Up to Date\" at this point.\r\n4. Create the same 10,000 files in the folder on A, but this time with a different case.\r\n5. Some of the newly created files fail to sync to B, because the previously created `~syncthing~<filename>.tmp~` files are still present in the folder.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[NISVV] 2020/09/09 08:25:08.279993 folder_sendrecv.go:684: DEBUG: sendreceive/uqzch-bwmvk@0xc0000fea80 parent not missing 368test.txt\r\n[NISVV] 2020/09/09 08:25:08.279993 folder_sendrecv.go:1108: DEBUG: sendreceive/uqzch-bwmvk@0xc0000fea80 need file 368test.txt; copy 1, reused 0\r\n[NISVV] 2020/09/09 08:25:08.279993 folder_sendrecv.go:1554: DEBUG: sendreceive/uqzch-bwmvk@0xc0000fea80 closing 368test.txt\r\n[NISVV] 2020/09/09 08:25:08.279993 folder_sendrecv.go:1790: DEBUG: sendreceive/uqzch-bwmvk@0xc0000fea80 new error for 368test.txt: opening temp file: given name \"~syncthing~368test.txt.tmp\" differs from name in filesystem \"~syncthing~368TEST.txt.tmp\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n![2020-09-09-08-16-36-0361920](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/92537154-68691000-f276-11ea-988b-d3b50c54f0f9.png)\r\n\r\nThe obvious workaround is to manually delete the temp files, but I think that Syncthing should apply the case sensitivity detection logic to the temp files too.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6973/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6973/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
