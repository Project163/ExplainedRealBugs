I think that just starting syncthing, going to settings and hitting the link to preview usage stats will do. There's a number in there for sha256 hashing performance in MB/s. That's not the only thing we do, but it's a common bottle neck and representative enough to get a feeling for it I think.\n\n(There's practically no floating point at all done, only things like dividing two byte counts to show the completion percentage when the gui asks for it and things like that.)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/69244694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/69253729","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1218#issuecomment-69253729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1218","id":69253729,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MjUzNzI5","user":{"login":"seidler2547","id":729588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOTU4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/729588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seidler2547","html_url":"https://github.com/seidler2547","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seidler2547/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seidler2547/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seidler2547/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seidler2547/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seidler2547/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seidler2547/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seidler2547/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seidler2547/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seidler2547/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-08T21:36:51Z","updated_at":"2015-01-08T21:36:51Z","body":"Hmm, that number is very inconsistent.
