adds the ip and route binaries to the snap. This resolves #5288, suppressing the security audit errors seen in the syslog. Built this on an Ubuntu 16.04 VM and tested on my Ubuntu 19.10 workstation.\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\n\r\nSyncthing expects to be able (via a sub-module) to call unix commands `ip` and `route` as part of normal operation. When packaged as a snap, those commands are unavailable. As a result, errors appear in the syslog whenever syncthing attempts to use these binaries. While this doesn't hamper significantly the operation of syncthing, it results in spam in the syslog, which can be offputting. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI build the snap in a clean Ubuntu 16.04 lxc container and transferred the result to my Ubuntu 19.10 laptop for testing. The snap produced did indeed no longer produce spam in the syslog regarding the `ip` and `route` commands. (Other, unrelated things may be shown in the syslog, which may be fixed in a subsequent PR :) ).\r\nBuild:\r\n`go run build.go -goos linux -goarch amd64 snap`\r\nInstall:\r\n`snap install syncthing_1.3.1-rc.1+2-g6b570ee-dirty-wat_amd64.snap --dangerous`\r\nTest - in another two terminals run the following commands:\r\n\r\n`dmesg -Tw`\r\nand\r\n`snappy-debug.security scanlog` (this will require you to have `snap install snappy-debug` already.\r\n\r\nRun the new syncthing snap with `/snap/bin/syncthing` and observe the lack of complaints in the output of the two other commands. It should suppress the following in syslog:\r\n```\r\n[Tue Oct  8 10:58:25 2019] audit: type=1400 audit(1570528705.738:868): apparmor=\"DENIED\" operation=\"exec\" profile=\"snap.syncthing.syncthing\"

release changes the default location for the index database under some circumstances. Two new flags can also be used to affect the location of the configuration (`-config`) and database (`-data`) separately. The old `-home` flag is equivalent to setting both of these to the same directory. When no flags are given the following logic is used to determine the data location:\r\n\r\n- If a database exists in the old default location, that location is still used. This means existing installations are not affected by this change.\r\n- If `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set, use `$XDG_DATA_HOME/syncthing`.\r\n- If `~/.local/share/syncthing` exists, use that location.\r\n- Use the old default location.\r\n\r\nThis logic is used on non-Windows, non-Mac platforms only.
