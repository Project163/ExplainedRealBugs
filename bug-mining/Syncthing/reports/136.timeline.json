this is quite a long post - but hopefully the information provided helps with explaining the issue fully.\n\n**EDIT AFTER SUBMISSION:**\nTo clarify as wrong terminology used below. The descriptions are correct - but the status described  for **Repo** actually should say the status for the **Node**.\n\nIn all the scenarios below the repo shows '_Up to Date_' on CompA and CompB. The Node for CompB (Linux) is the issue - as it states  '_Syncing (100%)_' as described per scenario. Sorry for any confusion caused with the terminology.\n### Overview\n\nI have two computers syncing a repo that contains multiple files and directories. The computers are:\n- CompA - Windows 8.1\n- CompB - Linux Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS \n\nBoth computers are running Syncthing version v0.10.10\n\nThe repo file system includes the following two directory structures:\n\n```\n hugo/\n    README.md\n    static/\n    layouts/\n    content/\n    config.toml\n\n www/\n    404.html\n    catagories/\n    css/\n    config.toml\n    README.md\n    sitemap.xml\n    posts/\n```\n\nThe objective is to create symbolic directory link from `hugo/public` to `www`  as depicted below:\n\n```\n hugo/\n    README.md\n    static/\n    layouts/\n    content/\n    config.toml\n    @public/ --> ../www\n\n www/\n    404.html\n    catagories/\n    css/\n    config.toml\n    README.md\n    sitemap.xml\n    posts/\n```\n#### Scenario One:\n\nWhen the symbolic directory link is created on CompA (Windows) with either:\n\n```\nAs Administrator ( from cli within `hugo/` )\n`mklink /d .\\public ..\\wiremoons.github.io`\n\nAs a User ( from cli within `hugo/` )\n`junction .\\public ..\\wiremoons.github.io`\n```\n\nthe following status is reach:\n\n```\nCompA : repo 'Up to Date'\nCompB : repo 'Up to Date'\n```\n\nSo basically the link on CompA is created and working, syncing of the repo is fine, the symbolic link on CompA is ignored by Syncthing, and does not get replicated to CompB.\n#### Scenario Two:\n\nAs per Scenario One above - but add the same symbolic directory link in the cli to  CompB (Linux) - so now the same symbolic directory link has been manually created both sides - via the addition on CompB with the command:\n\n```\nAs a User ( from cli within `hugo/` )\n`ln -s ../wiremoons.github.io ./public`\n```\n\nthe following status is reach:\n\n```\nCompA : repo 'Up to Date'\nCompB : repo 'Syncing (100%)'\n```\n\nThe status of CompB sits at 'Syncing (100%)'. However CompA is the same and believes the repos are in sync still.\n#### Scenario Three:\n\nAs per Scenario Two above - but remove the symbolic directory link in the cli on CompA (Windows) - so now the symbolic directory link only exists on CompB (Linux) files system. So this is the opposite of Scenario One:\n\nthe following status is reach:\n\n```\nCompA : repo 'Up to Date'\nCompB : repo 'Syncing (100%)'\n```\n\nThe status of CompB sits at 'Syncing (100%)'. CompA is the same and believes the repos are in sync still.\n#### Scenario Four:\n\nBack to Scenario Two above as a starting point (so symbolic links exist on both CompA and CompB) - but remove the symbolic directory link in the cli on CompB (Linux) - so now the symbolic directory link only exists on CompA (Windows) files system - basically restoring position back to Scenario One::\n\nthe following status is reach:\n\n```\nCompA : repo 'Up to Date'\nCompB : repo 'Up to Date'\n```\n### Point to this?\n\nWhy does having a symbolic link on CompA (Windows) repo get ignored ok and not replicated to CompB (as per design I believe?) - but as soon as an equivalent symbolic link is created on CompB (Linux), the CompB goes into a syncing state of 'Syncing (100%)'?\n\nIs it a OS difference bug?\n\nI have also seen error/notifications on CompA (Windows) stating that \"_Symlinks are unsupported as they require Administrator priviledges. This might cause your folder to appear out of sync._\"  The status is always 'Up to Date' though regardless of the symbolic links existing on that computer.\n\nCant say I have seen the same error on CompB (Linux) though - well at least I am not 100% sure sorry.\n\nAlso I saw for [Issue 1017](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1017) there is a new options to ignore symlinks completely - is this on by default, or do I have to enable it somewhere?\n\nThanks for you help\n\nSimon\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1095/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1127520419,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExMjc1MjA0MTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1127520419","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-16T21:11:03Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"c5def5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1127520424,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTEyNzUyMDQyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1127520424","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-16T21:11:03Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
