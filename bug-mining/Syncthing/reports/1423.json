Does your log mention database corruption?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Include required information\r\n\r\n- `syncthing v1.27.0@6069cf3`\r\n\r\n### Preamble\r\n\r\n[semver](https://semver.org/) lists following versions as correct:\r\n```\r\n<valid semver> ::= <version core>\r\n                 | <version core> \"-\" <pre-release>\r\n                 | <version core> \"+\" <build>\r\n                 | <version core> \"-\" <pre-release> \"+\" <build>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, `v1.27.0`, `v1.27.0-abc.1`, `v1.27.0-abc.1+xyz`, `v1.27.0+xyz` **all** are valid semver strings.\r\n\r\n### lib/build\r\n\r\n`lib/build` contains `allowedVersionExp`:\r\n```go\r\nallowedVersionExp = regexp.MustCompile(`^v\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+(-[a-z0-9]+)*(\\.\\d+)*(\\+\\d+-g[0-9a-f]+)?(-[^\\s]+)?$`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt allows `v1.27.0-abc.1+xyz` but not `v1.27.0+xyz`, thus if you built an app with that version (which is permitted by `build.go`) it won't start\r\n\r\n### lib/upgrade\r\n\r\n`lib/upgrade` uses `CompareVersions` to check for upgrade and `TestCompareVersions` uses `1.0.0+45` as test case\r\n\r\n`versionParts` (that is used inside) correctly parses both  `v1.27.0-abc.1+xyz` and `v1.27.0+xyz` yielding `[1, 27, 0] [abc, 1]` and `[1, 27, 0]` respectively.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n1. I suggest making versions in form of `<version core> \"+\" <build>` valid in `lib/build` because the both valid semver and already accepted by `lib/upgrade` and `build.go`\r\n2. Check `version` argument in `build.go` to avoid building binaries that can't be launched anyway","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9267/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
