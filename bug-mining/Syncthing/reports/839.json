Debian bug: https://bugs.debian.org/832387\n\nSyncthing should ship `.desktop` files.\n\nI'm opening this issue here because we probably want to update the upstream package to also ship `.desktop` files.\n\nSuggestion from the Debian bug:\n\n```\nOne slightly kludgy possibility would be to include two .desktop files:\nsyncthing.desktop:\n    [Desktop Entry]\n    Name=Syncthing\n    GenericName=Syncthing\n    Comment=\n    Exec=/usr/bin/syncthing\n    Terminal=false\n    Type=Application\n    X-Gnome-Autostart=true\n\nsyncthing-ui.desktop:\n    [Desktop Entry]\n    Encoding=UTF-8\n    Name=Syncthing UI\n    Type=Link\n    URL=http://localhost:8384\n    Icon=www\n```\n\nI think I would prefer to merge the two files.\n\nHowever I would like for that to be compatible with running syncthing with systemd using `syncthing@user`, which I think is great.\n\nAny ideas?\n","closed_by":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3439/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
