I'd propose to time the try and set the pause to at least that time (capped at 1h). If anything happens (scan, remote changes) that triggers a pull anyway, so you shouldn't \"miss out\" on a resolution like this. Does this sound reasonable?\r\n\r\nI think the problem with symlinks/directories is in how we handle (or not handle) conflicts for them: If a symlink or file wins a conflict over a directory, we will just remove that directory (we never create conflicts for symlinks or directories). That's obviously problematic if the directory has children. What I think we should do is let directories with children always win conflicts over files/symlinks regardless of mtime and move the file/symlink for conflict.

Potentially the high cpu usage is due to a discrepancy between the pauses between successive failed tries and how long one try takes: If it takes e.g. 10min, you get 10min activity, 1min pause, 10min activity, 2min pause, 10min activity, 4min pause, ... - so essentially lots of activity. I'd propose to time the try and set the pause to at least that time (capped at 1h). If anything happens (scan, remote changes) that triggers a pull anyway, so you shouldn't \"miss out\" on a resolution like this. Does this sound reasonable?\r\n\r\nThe change means, that if e.g. a pull took 30min and failed, the pause will be immediately 32min instead of just 1min. Or if it took longer than an hour, the pause will immediately be 1h (well 64min), but never more than that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5643/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/481635758","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5641#issuecomment-481635758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5641","id":481635758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTYzNTc1OA==","user":{"login":"pineapplemachine","id":7266412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNjY0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7266412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine","html_url":"https://github.com/pineapplemachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T10:31:46Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T10:48:48Z","body":"@imsodin This sounds like a reasonable change to me, but this doesn't seem like it's related to the issue I'm encountering.

The log ends shortly after I pause sync for that folder again.\r\n\r\nhttp://files.pineapplemachine.com/public/logs/Syncthing_Log_2019_04_10.txt","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/481648999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pineapplemachine","id":7266412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNjY0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7266412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine","html_url":"https://github.com/pineapplemachine","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pineapplemachine/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/481711677","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5641#issuecomment-481711677","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5641","id":481711677,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTcxMTY3Nw==","user":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-10T14:21:46Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T14:21:46Z","body":"The list of failed items matches exactly the described symlink/dir conflict.\r\n\r\nAnd the log shows that our logging policy might be a bit questionable: One line for every single error, and the same time no indication at the start and end of one iteration of trying to pull. Anyway the log excerpt you show is just one pull operation (and three iterations), the pause would only kick in the log. And some entries say that there is stuff to be scanned, which might trap you in a loop that doesn't let the pause kick in: Pull schedules scan, scan doesn't see anything (symlink), but still schedules another pull (that shouldn't happen though as far as I remember) -> start again. Anyhow, that would be resolved by the proposed handling of conflicts of directories.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/481711677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2266268555,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjI2NjI2ODU1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2266268555","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"9b2a73f9abb34e6bd207570a14121fb20a43735a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/9b2a73f9abb34e6bd207570a14121fb20a43735a","created_at":"2019-04-10T14:22:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-14T10:48:46Z","updated_at":"2019-04-14T10:48:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5654","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5654/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5654/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5654/events","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5654","id":432958526,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MzI5NTg1MjY=","number":5654,"title":"Incorrect
