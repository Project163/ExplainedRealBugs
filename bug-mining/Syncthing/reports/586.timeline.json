support for -auditfile=<target> where <target> is \"-\" for stdout, \"--\" for stderr, or a filename.  It can be left blank (or left out entirely) for the original behaviour of creating a timestamped filename.\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\n\r\nEliminates requirement for a front end to use the events API to get event data.  The event data can be captured from stdout or stderr for more a more responsive front end.  Since it was trivial and had no obvious drawbacks, the ability to send the events audit data to an arbitrary file was added also.  When the audit file name is given explicitly event data is appended should the file exist. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTested environments:\r\n- Windows 10 Go 1.7.3 in MinGW (msys2)\r\n- Linux Mint 18.1 (Ubuntu 16.04) Go 1.7.4\r\n\r\nTests performed:\r\n1. Command: `./syncthing -no-restart -no-browser -audit -auditfile=- 2> errout1`\r\nExpected result: Event audit displayed on console interleaved with log, no output in errout\r\nResult: As expected\r\n\r\n2. Command: `./syncthing -no-restart -no-browser -audit -auditfile=-- 1> testlog2 2> errout2`\r\nExpected result: Event audit written to errout2, log data sent to testlog2, no output on screen\r\nResult: As expected\r\n\r\n3. Command: `./syncthing -no-restart -no-browser -audit -auditfile=testaudit 1> testlog3 2> errout3`\r\nExpected result: Event audit written to testaudit, log data sent to testlog3, no output on screen, no output in errout3\r\nResult: As expected\r\n\r\n4. Command: `./syncthing -no-restart -no-browser -audit -auditfile=testaudit 1> testlog4 2> errout4`\r\nExpected result: Event audit appended to data in testaudit from test #3, log data sent to testlog4, no output on screen, no output in errout4\r\nResult: As expected.\r\n\r\n5. Command: `./syncthing -no-restart -no-browser -audit -auditfile=\"\"`\r\nExpected result: Event audit written to a file with a timestamped filename chosen by syncthing.  Performing this test twice in a row very quickly (twice in the same second) should cause the second attempt to report a fatal error and terminate because the file exists.\r\nResult: As expected\r\n\r\n6. Command: `./syncthing -no-restart -no-browser -audit`\r\nExpected result: Identical to test 5.\r\nResult: As expected\r\n\r\n### Authorship\r\n\r\nKurt Fitzner\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3860/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3860/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":909518452,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTA5NTE4NDUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/909518452","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"79dd6918f2e2defd0a4cd8576fec2f3cd88e879f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/79dd6918f2e2defd0a4cd8576fec2f3cd88e879f","created_at":"2017-01-03T08:54:33Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1409083155,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE0MDkwODMxNTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1409083155","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-04T08:00:12Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1409083157,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTQwOTA4MzE1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1409083157","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-04T08:00:12Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
