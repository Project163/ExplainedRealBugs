This limits Syncthing's peak RAM usage when there are many connected devices all requesting file data. The default is 256 MiB.\r\n\r\n- The config option maxConcurrentScans has been removed and replaced a new config option maxFolderConcurrency. In addition to just limiting concurrent scans it now also limits concurrent sync operations. The default is the number of available CPU threads (\"GOMAXPROCS\").\r\n\r\n- Syncthing now always runs the monitor process, which previously was disabled with -no-restart. This facilitates crash reporting and makes logging behave more consistently. The observed behavior with -no-restart should be the same as before but the internals differ.\r\n\r\n- The database schema has been improved and will result in a migration plus compaction at first startup after the upgrade.\r\n","creator":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":53,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-16T06:48:10Z","updated_at":"2020-03-17T06:20:59Z","due_on":"2020-03-17T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-03-17T06:20:59Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-02-13T09:57:06Z","updated_at":"2021-02-13T07:02:32Z","closed_at":"2020-02-13T12:05:29Z","author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"Database updates are tracked by sequence number.
