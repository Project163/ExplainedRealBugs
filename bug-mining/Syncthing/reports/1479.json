Namely all dialogs close always OK on click-outside, but <pity>never close</pity> none of them on Esc key once another tab is selected, unless we click anywhere in it before (that is, an other way to say the same : Escape key works everywhere but just after we select another tab in dialogs). It is like the dialog looses focus on opening new tab. Although this focus loose seems to affect the Esc key only because then hitting Tab rises the focus to the next object (input field, link image…) in the dialog and then Esc works again. Guessed? I’m a keyboard fan, not a friend of rodents, so I’d like we get an homogeneous way everywhere with… Esc.\r\n\r\nI seems dialogs are created with a default closeOnEsc attribute, but the tabs are not.\n\n### Syncthing version\n\nv1.27.5-rc.2\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nLinux\n\n### Browser version\n\nFirefox 124\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"marbens-arch","id":172933068,"node_id":"U_kgDOCk6_zA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172933068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marbens-arch","html_url":"https://github.com/marbens-arch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marbens-arch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marbens-arch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marbens-arch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marbens-arch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marbens-arch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marbens-arch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marbens-arch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marbens-arch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marbens-arch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9489/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
