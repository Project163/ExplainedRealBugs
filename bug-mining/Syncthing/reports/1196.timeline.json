I did the following, in my existing smoothly running setup.\r\n\r\n- On \"pseudo\", share existing older \"foto-albums\" with \"lun0\".\r\n- On lun0, accept the folder as receive only.\r\n\r\nData started flowing, end result being the following, on pseudo (the source):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1163\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-01-31 at 11 47 14\"

\"first\" in the folder (alphabetically), possibly those with the lowest sequence numbers. They are correctly present on disk.\r\n\r\nI took database snapshots.\r\n\r\nThen, just for fun, I restarted pseudo, thinking this should have no effect. The problem went away and everything looks in sync, as it should. Looking at the logs from the restart I have this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJan 31 11:51:14 pseudo syncthing[901]: [PSEUD] INFO: Stored folder metadata for \"smaoh-2qdsh\" is 754h0m0s old; recalculating\r\nJan 31 11:51:15 pseudo syncthing[901]: [PSEUD] INFO: Ready to synchronize \"foto/albums\" (smaoh-2qdsh) (receiveonly)\r\n```\r\n\r\nso the folder metadata was recalculated, and was probably what was wrong to begin with. So somehow we missed updating some part of the metadata with the incoming index updates directly after sharing the

we return a progress of `blockSize / 2` for files with a single block. That means that the reported progress is potentially larger than the total amount of bytes to sync in total. That leads to the 100% progress reported from the start reported in #7263.\r\n\r\nBecause I felt like it I adjusted the bytes estimate to be based on the probability that the small block is part of the given number of blocks, based on the total number of blocks in the file. That returns the actual file size for single block files, which fixes the above problem (which could obviously have been achieved in a much simpler way). For larger files the estimate will be a bit \"better\", probably entirely unnoticeably better.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7316/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4270854518,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDI3MDg1NDUxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4270854518","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"052dc134873c356742d8353c2892a7684d1be9cc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/052dc134873c356742d8353c2892a7684d1be9cc","created_at":"2021-01-31T22:40:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4289665781,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQyODk2NjU3ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4289665781","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-04T09:05:18Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.14.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5985987855,"node_id":"LE_lADOAOCAEs4uqpsDzwAAAAFkyu0P","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/5985987855","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-01T07:02:39Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5985987886,"node_id":"LOE_lADOAOCAEs4uqpsDzwAAAAFkyu0u","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/5985987886","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sync
