new folder is created/added various advanced settings have a default values (rescan interval, pull order, versioning, etc.)\r\n\r\nMaking these defaults editable would help a lot to streamline deployments.\r\n\r\nUsually I use a custom values for the above, but they are always consistent per machine:\r\nFor example:\r\nOn a file server: certain rescan rate, specific versioning scheme.\r\nOn a mobile clients: other rescan rate, other versioning scheme.\r\n\r\nAnd for every folder added to any of the devices there are many clicks to set the corresponding parameters.\r\nAllowing to \"save current settings as default\" (or something like that) will save a lot of time and improve UX.\r\n\r\n(also, the back end for this will be useful once \"auto-accept folders\" is a reality)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4224/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4224/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
