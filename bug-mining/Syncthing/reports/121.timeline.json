When changed (updated or closed) they will send message through channel to tracker to make it update the sync progress. I've implemented it and it works fine.

I think about adding new event type but I have doubts if it is efficient enough (sending event every updated block creates many many events). Is the idea to track sharedPullerStates right and how should I make gui update itself (add new event type or make gui update itself every few seconds during syncing phase or something else)?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/62873456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"piob-io","id":2089628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2089628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io","html_url":"https://github.com/piob-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/62874650","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/476#issuecomment-62874650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/476","id":62874650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODc0NjUw","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-13T11:01:01Z","updated_at":"2014-11-13T11:01:01Z","body":"So my vision was to add a separate go routine to the sharedPullerState which would track the state, and given it's changed, every N seconds would fire off the change via the events interface through to the UI.\nIt should also carry the information about how many blocks were copied, pulled, etc so that we could have a nice progress bar showing how much of what is coming from where.\n\nOr the other way which I think the way you've done it is even better, as all the pullers share a single channel which they send information through to, and then the tracker sucks on the channel, accumulates the updates and fires them off every N seconds.\n\nEither way, I can look into your implementation and perhaps make suggestions (if any) if you'd like.\n\nRegardless I am really happy somebody has started looking into this. \nGood

is my first basic stab at it.\nI am not sure, maybe your publish approach is better than my pull approach, but I somehow felt that \nthere might be channel contention at the emitter since every 128kb copied or pulled would have to push something down the progress channel, plus when there is 18 different routines hammering stuff through the channel\n\nExisting two issues my approach is that the `.Register` should be done after the state has been received at the copy channel, because the way it is now it makes it look like there are two downloads in progress, where in reality there is only one, and the other is hanging on the channel to be read.\nThe other issue it doesn't actually update the progress live, you need to refresh the page, I think it's missing the `refreshFolder` call you are making.\n\nMy vision was to extend the `Out of sync` dialog, and add a stacked progress bar stacking from different colours one fo each:\n1.

Maybe each `pullerIteration` will activate the `ProgressEmitter` if it's not currently working and it will deactivate itself when last `pullerIteration` will finish.\n\nI may be wrong, but I don't like `ProgressEmitter.registry` being a `map[string]*sharedPullerState`. Is `s.folder+s.file.Name` really a unique-per-file-in-folder string? I just imagine something like folder \"a\" with file \"bc\" and folder \"ab\" with file \"c\". Why isn't it of type `map[string]map[string]*sharedPullerState` like `last`?\n\nAlso, I think that `finisherRoutine` doesn't handle `earlyClosed` `sharedPullerStates`, so they might not get deregistered.\n\nSize of file is calculated this way:\n\n```\nif f.NumBlocks < 2 {\n    return BlockSize / 2\n} else {\n    return int64(f.NumBlocks-1)*BlockSize + BlockSize/2\n}\n```\n\n, so I think that just subtracting `int64(m.progressEmitter.BlocksCompleted(folder)*protocol.BlockSize)` in `NeedSize` may be too inaccurate. I don't see a nice way to repair it, but why isn't the size of file simply `int64(f.NumBlocks)*BlockSize`?\n\nAbout live progress, I just call `refreshFolder`, but I think that the better way would be

the emitter working always, I guess when we deregister the last element, we can just do `timer.Stop()`, and when we register the first element, we can just do `timer.Reset(interval)`\n\nYou are right, `s.folder+s.file.Name` might not be unique, but `filepath.Join(s.folder, s.file.Name)` is guaranteed to be, as you cannot have two folders with the same name.\nThe reason I chose a 1 level map is just to avoid the hassle of creating a submap for each folder.\nPlus in the future, folders might come and go, so I would either have to do `do I have a submap for this particular folder yet`, or alternatively handle folder changes from the config handler.\n\nRegarding `earlyClose` and file sizes, you are completely right, it's just unfinished work.\nIt's easy to fix my current mess with blocks, I guess you should just create a new function in protocol package:\n\n```\nfunc BlocksToSize(num int) int64 {\n  if num < 2 {\n    return BlockSize / 2\n  }\n  return int64(num-1)*BlockSize + BlockSize/2\n}\n```\n\nAnd then replace the calculation in both places with this function call.\n\nThe reason the calculation is done this way is because blocks are rounded up to the closest 128kb, so even a 1 byte file counts as 128kb, therefore what this does, is tries to round it down to the closes half... which doesn't help that much, but does help a bit I guess.\n\nWould you be interested in ironing this out in full, and perhaps making a pull request?\nIf yes, the CSS tweaks required for the progress bar can be found here:\nhttp://jsbin.com/kutudabiwa/1/edit?html,css,output\nI guess we can go full blown animated progress bars\n\nIf not, let me know, and I'll try to find some time for this myself :+1:

I think what happens is this: let's say file of size 1GB is being synchronized, and 0.5GB is now pulled. Somewhere this file is changed to be 0.2GB. Now our sync % will be calculated like this: \n`(total - left) / total = (total - (size - synced)) / total = (total - (0.2-0.5)) / total > 1`.\nIt is also possible, that I messed something up. I would be glad if you could check if the idea of decreasing bytes in `model.NeedSize` by `m.progressEmitter.BytesCompleted` is correct.\nBy the way, that css tweak should be put in overrides.css,

is what I've changed.\n\nI don't  brutally change percentage to always be between 0 and 100, because I think it's misleading. If you want that workaround, I will put it. However, for I think the same reason, out of sync can also have negative bytes count. I thought about getting better values from `progressemiter`, but it doesn't know about all files currently being synced (until their processing starts).\n\nThere is also one more issue:\nI'm holding progress stats in app.js, and when DownloadProgress event comes, I update this stats, not replace them. Otherwise, when showing out of sync dialogs, right after finishing, progress bar would revert to showing 0/0. On the other hand, because `progressemiter` doesn't know about all files currently being synced, so when this syncs complete and next begins with same files, progress bars show data from previous sync. So, I don't know, when to delete the stats (always/never both seems bad).\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/64077863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"piob-io","id":2089628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODk2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2089628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io","html_url":"https://github.com/piob-io","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piob-io/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/64079312","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/476#issuecomment-64079312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/476","id":64079312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDc5MzEy","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-22T12:53:07Z","updated_at":"2014-11-22T12:53:07Z","body":"So
