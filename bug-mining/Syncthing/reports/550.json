I can see StateChanged events for it, where it starts scanning, then stops again, but that's it. Grabbing the scope for that folder, and looking at `failed` also returns an empty object.\n\nThe computer which the files were being synced from is currently offline, and Syncthing was restarted since (in order to upgrade from 0.14.5). Could this be related - Syncthing isn't trying to fetch the file, and so can't remember why it failed?\n\nIf so, showing 'Out of Sync' and the 'loading' icon is somewhat misleading - it implies that more information is going to appear soon. Would it make sense to record the reason for failure in the database? At the very least, better indicate that no devices are online, and so details about the files items aren't going to be available for a while.\n### Version Information\n\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.7\nOS Version: Linux StorageDroid 3.10.103-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Aug 29 20:27:51 MDT 2016 armv7l GNU/Linux\nBrowser Version: FF 49.0.1\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3647/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3647/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
