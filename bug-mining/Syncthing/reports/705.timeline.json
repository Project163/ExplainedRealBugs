We've discussed it back and forth a couple of times before, but the short of it is that if we don't do this you'll have a bunch of API methods that return 500 or bad data until this is done.\r\n\r\nI think your log is cut off a bit early, but you'll see some \"initial scan completed\" log entries when that part is actually done. The \"ready to synchronize\" thing is just that we've created the structures and summarized what we have in the database.\r\n\r\nNow... What takes time in that step is that we actually look through all database entries for the folder to make sure that they are not corrupt, and to count them. We could potentially keep the count in the database instead of doing it at startup, but then we need to account for the fact that it may be incorrect. Maybe recalculate it now and then.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/331794041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/331801753","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4400#issuecomment-331801753","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4400","id":331801753,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMTgwMTc1Mw==","user":{"login":"Nutomic","id":1044450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1044450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic","html_url":"https://github.com/Nutomic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-25T07:41:56Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T07:41:56Z","body":"Right, I wasn't sure what exactly is going on, I was only going by the log messages.\r\n\r\nSo if I understand you correctly, Syncthing needs to have this information while it's running. So it should be enough to store it in the database when Syncthing is stopped. Then you just need to handle the case where Syncthing crashes (you could probably do that by saving timestamps for last start/stop and comparing them.\r\n\r\nIt definitely seems worth the effort,
