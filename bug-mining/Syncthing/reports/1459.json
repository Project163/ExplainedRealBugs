What happened?\n\nsyncthing used to work with a unix socket as a GUI address, e.g. when using a command line option like this:\r\n\r\n`-gui-address=unix:///run/syncthing/syncthing.sock`\r\n\r\nIt worked until 1.28.0 (including), and then in 1.28.1. it broke and complains.\r\n\r\nI think PR #9675 is the culprit, more specifically commit 65d0ca8aa96efa785fe9527de992e7efaabc22bd\n\n### Syncthing version\n\nv1.28.1\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nLinux amd64\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n[start] WARNING: Failed to initialize config: failed to generate default config: get default port (GUI): address /run/syncthing/syncthing.sock: missing port in address\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9855/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
