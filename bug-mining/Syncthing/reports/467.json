to [this](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/ignoring-d-prefix-eadir-folder/7437), have been asked by @AudriusButkevicius to raise an issue\n\n---\n\nDevices : 3 Synology NAS DS215j\nRunning Syncthing v0.13.2\nSharing a big folder of media files\n\nEach subfolder containing one or more media files contains one hidden folder `@eaDir` containing subfolders and temporary files.\n\n```\nBIGFOLDER\\\nBIGFOLDER\\SOME_MEDIA\\\nBIGFOLDER\\SOME_MEDIA\\MEDIA_FILE.EXT\nBIGFOLDER\\SOME_MEDIA\\@eaDir\\Random_temp_file.ext\nBIGFOLDER\\SOME_MEDIA\\@eaDir\\Random_temp_subfolder\\\nBIGFOLDER\\SOME_MEDIA\\@eaDir\\Randem_temp_subfolder\\Random_temp_file.ext\n```\n\nAt the moment, .stignore contains on each node :\n\n```\n(?d)@eaDir \n```\n\nIf I remove the `SOME_MEDIA` folder on one node, the other nodes display :\n\n`[REDACTED] 10:52:45 INFO: Puller (folder \"BIGFOLDER\", dir \"SOME_MEDIA\"): delete: remove /volume/BIGFOLDER/SOME_MEDIA: directory not empty`\n\nI thought that prefixing `@eaDir` with `(?d)` would allow deletion, but it doesn't seem to work.\n\nI tried the `(?d)@eaDir/**` pattern too, but it doesn't seem to work too.\n\nAny ideas on how to handle deletion of those ignored `@eaDir` subdirectories and their respective content when deleting directories ?\n\nI can provide much more details if needed.\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3164/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
