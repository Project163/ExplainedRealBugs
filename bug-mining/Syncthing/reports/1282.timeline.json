started looking into this and think it needs some more clarification.  In principle, what you want to achieve can be done with just a snippet `config.xml` file that you pre-populate only with those options that your installer wants to set.  The purpose for the `--gui-user` and `--gui-password` options is mainly to avoid the need to hash the password externally.  Giving either of those results in a fully normalized `config.xml` being generated, possibly based on any pre-existing file.\r\n\r\nRight now, when a `config.xml` file already exists during `syncthing generate`, we just leave it alone as long as none of the above options were supplied.  That could be changed to always read, normalize and write the config file, which would otherwise happen anyway during the first run of `syncthing serve`.  That avoids the need for additional CLI options to set any possible config element.  And your installer can make sure the config snippet is valid before actually running `syncthing serve`.\r\n\r\nWhat may help with the original issue here would be a new `--skip-port-probing` option, which applies for both `generate` and `serve` (first run) subcommands.  Note that the probing is done for the GUI and the listen address, but only when no `config.xml` file previously exists.
