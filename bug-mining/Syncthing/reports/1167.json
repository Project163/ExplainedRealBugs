Those could then display a link in their GUI's respective device box.\r\n\r\nI think this would make remote administration much less painful, but of course requires a protocol extension and some logic to find the right address.  Basically:\r\n\r\n- If the GUI listen address is set to localhost, do not advertise it.\r\n- If set to a specific address, advertise that and `bind()` to it.\r\n  * TBD: Should an address be allowed where `bind()` fails?  It would be useful for Dynamic DNS, tunnels, or NAT routing, but risks linking to totally unrelated hosts.\r\n- Send a flag to indicate whether the connection requires HTTPS.\r\n\r\nOn the receiving end:\r\n- Display the advertised address as a link.  If `0.0.0.0` was advertised, use the last IP address where a successful direct connection was made.\r\n- If HTTPS is required, the receiving end could try connecting to the port and see if the certificate matches the device.\r\n\r\nDoes that sound like a reasonable proposal?  I'm not familiar with Syncthing's code or Go at all, so I cannot immediately offer taking a stab at implementing any of this.","closed_by":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4824/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
