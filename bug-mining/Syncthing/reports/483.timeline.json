it a windows thing only? it seems like a very non linux way of updating software, Which is often relying on official repos and fixed version per dist of seleced OS, with backported security fixes. Running latest blindly could lead to very unreliable software if unexpeced bugs pop up from the update.\n\nA scenario which I would like to use syncthing for in the future.\n- right now I use rsync to sync files between multiple webservers which is loadbalanced by a proxy above them. So they need the same docroots, Here syncthing is ideal,\n- its serving a cluster of webservers which is setup like this because to provide redunancy and reliability, \n- When everything is setup and syncthing is syncing files happily, All I want from syncthing is stability and reliability to sync my docroot between all webservers so they are identical.\n\nI dont want updates that might require me to edit config files, require me to resync from beginning because the index is not compatible with the old version. etc.. \nThis autoupdate is a desktop regular home user way of updating, not server software, but maybe syncthing is not geared towards that? I was hoping and following the project for hoping it might be the replacement of rsync which is pretty standard if you dont use SAN with either NFS/CIFS/ISCSI etc to sync/keep all docroots identical.\n\nlong post :)

we reopen this for consideration? The original concern was that custom builds shouldn't try to upgrade, however I'm not sure which custom builds these are exactly. :) If they're custom enough to include custom code, I think it's not too much of a burden to add `-no-upgrade` to the build process or set `$NOUPGRADE` when running, or disable auto upgrade in the config. For regular dev builds, we now correctly interpret them as newer than the thing they come from, which may not have been the case earlier:\n\n```\njb@syno:~/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing git:(𝘮 88 ⇄ 15 v0.11) $ ./bin/syncthing -upgrade\n08:48:34 INFO: No upgrade available (current \"v0.11.24+1-g4b5c44b\" >= latest \"v0.11.24\").\n```\n\nThe reason I want to maybe revert this, is that I like to give people dev builds when they're suffering from a bug that's fixed but it's going to be another week until a release that includes it. But I don't want them to get stuck forever on that dev build...\n\nEssentially I'd like to revert this part:
