is a data race in the replication layer that can result in a panic. The race is that we send a slice of addresses to the replication, where it gets queued in a channel, and then also the the database. The database will sort the slice while merging with an existing record, and with some bad luck this happens while the replication routine is marshalling the same slice.\r\n\r\n```\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: panic: runtime error: slice bounds out of range [-125:]\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv:\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: goroutine 54 [running]:\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: main.(*DatabaseAddress).MarshalToSizedBuffer(0xc005010690, 0xc0014e2404, 0x6f, 0x3fc, 0xef, 0x70, 0x0)\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: #011/opt/tcagent/syncthing-4-work/174e136266f8a219/cmd/stdiscosrv/database.pb.go:300 +0x18a\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: main.(*ReplicationRecord).MarshalToSizedBuffer(0xc0011cbdc0, 0xc0014e2404, 0x190, 0x3fc, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: #011/opt/tcagent/syncthing-4-work/174e136266f8a219/cmd/stdiscosrv/database.pb.go:252 +0xc8\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: main.(*ReplicationRecord).MarshalTo(0xc0011cbdc0, 0xc0014e2404, 0x3fc, 0x3fc, 0x7f368e73f001, 0xc004fa8340, 0x0)\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: #011/opt/tcagent/syncthing-4-work/174e136266f8a219/cmd/stdiscosrv/database.pb.go:236 +0x5c\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: main.(*replicationSender).Serve(0xc0000943c0)\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: #011/opt/tcagent/syncthing-4-work/174e136266f8a219/cmd/stdiscosrv/replication.go:109 +0x597\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: github.com/thejerf/suture.(*Supervisor).runService.func1(0xc0003a8000, 0x1, 0xaf3780, 0xc0000943c0)\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: #011/opt/tcagent/syncthing-4-work/pkg/mod/github.com/thejerf/suture@v3.0.2+incompatible/supervisor.go:600 +0x50\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: created by github.com/thejerf/suture.(*Supervisor).runService\r\nOct 18 06:20:33 discovery-1 discosrv: #011/opt/tcagent/syncthing-4-work/pkg/mod/github.com/thejerf/suture@v3.0.2+incompatible/supervisor.go:588 +0x5b\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6093/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
