Once this happens\nthe folder is essentially \"stuck\" until you hit the override button. No changes occurred on the\nMac. Since there were no changes on the mac, I didn't expect the \"out of sync\" to pop up.\nOnce I hit the override changes, the out-of-sync goes away and doesn't appear to come back\nfor that file (though subsequent new files will cause it to pop up again.)\nMaybe something to do with the new higher-res file times?\n\nThis problem didn't exist in 0.13.10.\n### Version Information\n\nSyncthing Version: 0.14.4\nOS Version: ubuntu 14.04/MacOSX (whatever the latest is)\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3516/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
