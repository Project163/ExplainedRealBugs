We propagate this to the UI so the folder _looks_ stopped and shows the error in question. But we never even look at the `Invalid` attribute anywhere else in the code, so the folder is in fact running as usual and doing scans and whatnot.\n\nWe need to have `Invalid` actually invalidate a folder, and do it in a way that doesn't get revived by `CheckFolderHealth`. It should be used only for nonrecoverable errors - config error, or potentially the new checksum mismatch error.\n\nAlternatively we could just refuse to load the config when it's broken in this manner, have `CheckFolderHealth` handle the missing path case (it probably already does) and remove the `Invalid` thing altogether?\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2471/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
