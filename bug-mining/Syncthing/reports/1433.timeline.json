Of course, still not a lot, but 30 %  increase (which of course also translates in UPS runtime) was reason for the nerd to start investigating, and the power consumption data basically looked as if there was a \"leak\" (not in memory, but in CPU usage). \r\nSince restarting Syncthing brought it back down to 3 W right away, I came here :wink: . \r\n\r\nThen I found the increased number of `epoll_wait` syscalls which Syncthing appears to be doing after prolonged runtime, but maybe that's just the way goroutines interact. \r\n\r\nDo you think it is likely that configuration can trigger this? \r\nI don't have anything (obviously) special configured apart from staggered versioning, which is probably not related. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to dump the number of goroutines at runtime, then I could confirm that this number is also constant for me? \r\n\r\nIf we don't find the cause, or you think it is not fruitful to delve deeper, that is of course also perfectly fine with me — then I will likely work around this with a daily restart or decrease the interval for full scans (or both) for the system. \r\nThanks in any case for checking and trying to reproduce on your end!

What happened?\r\n\r\nI have the issue that the needed CPU ressources are getting higher over time (just idle and no clients are connected). The bug was introduced by 1.27.2 i would say but i can not test it because i dont know how to switch back to that version (apt-get just offered 1.27.3 as oldest version to me).\r\nAnyway if i restart syncthing and open top, i can see the cpu consumption by around 0.0% - 0.3% on my notebook (no clients connected!). A few hours later the cpu consumption is 2-3 times higher and now at 0.7% - 1.3% permanently (never goes down to 0.0% again). That may not sound like much but it is enough to increase the overall CPU temperature of my notebook by around 8°C which causes the fan to start all the time (noise).\r\nMy workaround for now is to restart the server every few hours which is not really nice somehow...\r\n\r\n### Syncthing version\r\n\r\nv1.27.4\r\n\r\n### Platform & operating system\r\n\r\nLinux Amd64\r\n\r\n### Browser version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9467/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13414723004,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs5_ImH_zwAAAAMflG28","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/13414723004","actor":{"login":"rasa","id":220772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa","html_url":"https://github.com/rasa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"685d17ee674777f34bb01fbc5ff33d296cab986a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rasa/syncthing/commits/685d17ee674777f34bb01fbc5ff33d296cab986a","created_at":"2024-07-07T18:58:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13414752220,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs5_ImH_zwAAAAMflN_c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/13414752220","actor":{"login":"rasa","id":220772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa","html_url":"https://github.com/rasa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"199e1760f5204324179f0da112f19f5ea7305484","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/calmh/syncthing/commits/199e1760f5204324179f0da112f19f5ea7305484","created_at":"2024-07-07T19:17:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
