where exactly this is configured, but it would be useful to have the name recorded as \"Syncthing\", so that it is easy to find it in the firewall settings.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/107137544-eaa64f00-6950-11eb-974d-2c95c1c59f60.png)\r\n\r\n**Edit**: The problem can also be seen when adding the program to
