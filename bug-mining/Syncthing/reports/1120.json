to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new folder on Device A, set it to \"Send Only\", and add some files to it.\r\n2. Share the folder with Device B.\r\n3. Accept the folder on Device B and set its type to \"Receive Only\".\r\n4. Delete some files from the folder on Device B. The folder is now marked \"Local Additions\".\r\n5. Change the folder type on Device B to \"Send & Receive\".\r\n6. Both folders show \"Up to Date\", but the files remain deleted, which is reflected in the \"Local State\" on Device B.\r\n\r\nDevice A:\r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/88773678-657df880-d1bd-11ea-91de-ad66643b5bec.png)\r\n\r\nDevice B:\r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/88775903-416fe680-d1c0-11ea-8f33-ab9a15a50050.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6864/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
