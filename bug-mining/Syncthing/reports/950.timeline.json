Purpose\r\n\r\nThere was really nothing to fix, as I checked the entire code base and **all** atomically accessed 64-bit variables (via sync/atomic) **are** actually 64-bit aligned.\r\n\r\nThis is the commit message:\r\n\r\nPer the [`sync/atomic` bug note](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/atomic/#pkg-note-BUG):\r\n\r\n> On ARM, x86-32, and 32-bit MIPS, it is the caller's\r\n> responsibility to arrange for 64-bit alignment of 64-bit words\r\n> accessed atomically. The first word in a variable or in an\r\n> allocated struct, array, or slice can be relied upon to be\r\n> 64-bit aligned.\r\n\r\nAll atomic accesses of 64-bit variables in syncthing code base are\r\ncurrently ok (i.e they are all 64-bit aligned).\r\n\r\nGenerally, the bug is triggered because of incorrect alignement\r\nof struct fields. Free variables (declared in a function) are\r\nguaranteed to be 64-bit aligned by the Go compiler.\r\n\r\nTo ensure the code remains correct upon further addition/removal\r\nof fields, which would change the currently correct alignment, I\r\nadded the following comment where required:\r\n\r\n     // atomic, must remain 64-bit aligned\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI ran the tests on an arm v6 platform. \r\nNo tests have been added as the only code modifications are added comments.\r\n\r\n\r\ncloses
