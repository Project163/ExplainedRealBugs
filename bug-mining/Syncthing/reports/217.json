Address - add a integer to indicate the protocol over which the client is listening, or alternatively, ideally replace addresses with a `[]string` then sending full URLs with arbitrary amount of information, such as `dst://123.123.123.123:22002/?certname=pulse`\n\nBEP:\n1. Request - Add hash of the block being requested - So that in the future we could verify that the block we've read matches the hash, and to do block lookups by hash.\n2. Request - Add `[]Options` for general extensibility\n3. Folder - Add `[]Options` for general extensibility (and in the future perhaps sending some verification to the receiver to indicate that we hold the correct encryption key for that folder)\n4. IndexMessage - Add `[]Options` for general extensibility (and in the future perhaps sending a signature over the IndexMessage if the folder is encrypted to verify that we have the correct key hence other party should accept our index update)\n5. Probably some new derivative of IndexMessage required for #950 \n6. Some better response mechanism for Requests (to indicate that we don't have the block anymore for example)\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1027/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
