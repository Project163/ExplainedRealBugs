But why not?\r\n\r\nI have an otherwise empty test folder with a custom icon `C:\\sync\\test_folder_with_icon`. When synced to a Windows machine that is running Syncthing built with Go 1.14 (`syncthing v1.4.0-rc.11+38-g20aaa592 \"Fermium Flea\" (go1.14 windows-amd64)`) and then deleted on the original machine, Syncthing fails to delete the folder, just as before. However, I can successfully delete the very same folder (regardless of whether or not the `desktop.ini` has already been deleted) using a simple Go program built with Go 1.14:\r\n\r\n``` go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n\t\"os\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\terr := os.RemoveAll(\"C:/sync/test_folder_with_icon\")\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\tpanic(err)\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy Go knowledge is limited. What is the difference between what Syncthing does and what the short program above does?

directories.](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/20aaa5927b982b7fdd01c173b58dc534f59aceee/lib/fs/basicfs.go#L164)","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/597332537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Nnnes","id":28599170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTk5MTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28599170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nnnes","html_url":"https://github.com/Nnnes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nnnes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nnnes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nnnes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nnnes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nnnes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nnnes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nnnes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nnnes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nnnes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3116562951,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzExNjU2Mjk1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/3116562951","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-10T21:43:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3116562955,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMxMTY1NjI5NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/3116562955","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-10T21:43:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/597334066","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3744#issuecomment-597334066","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3744","id":597334066,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NzMzNDA2Ng==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_vi
