that's a way, although I'm not too fond of it. Are we sure all paths are covered? What if I add or remove a \"go\" somewhere, it's kind of dirty that that a function needs to know whether it's going to be run as a separate goroutine or not...\n\nNow I'm thinking of another approach that might be of help in other scenarios as well, like reporting to Sentry and similar. We can't really do that reliably from within the same process, because the panic() could be something that's bad enough that the process is in a state where it can't continue (i.e. out of stack space or similar). But if we had a monitor process that started syncthing and monitored it for crash output (stderr) and sees when the process dies, we could both report errors and perhaps perform more reliable restarts?\n\nWe don't want to ship a separate monitor program, but syncthing could enter \"monitor mode\" by default, and start itself again with an environment variable set to indicate that it's being monitored and should continue as it does today. When running in monitor mode, it would only look at (and pipe through) log output, handle crashes and restarts, etc.\n\nBasically two programs where one is quite simple, just bundled in the same binary.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/54028828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/54035269","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/586#issuecomment-54035269","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/586","id":54035269,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MDM1MjY5","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-01T08:46:33Z","updated_at":"2014-09-01T19:18:42Z","body":"So the other alternative is to do:\n\n``` go\ngo raven.CapturePanic(func() {\n  the_routine_I_want_to_run(args)\n})\n```\n\nI think it's easy enough to grep for 'go ' and figure all the cases that are missing.\nPlus, if all the code follows this logic, I don't think it will be that hard to maintain it, and others will notice it quite easily.\n\nNot exactly sure how Sentry looks like for go, but for python it's very nice as you have the source code available around the stack traces, as well as the variables on the stack and so on, so that makes the debugging super easy.
