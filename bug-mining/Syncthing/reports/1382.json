with `setLowPriority` set to `true`, always sets its child process priority to `Below normal`, even if the parent priority is already lower than that.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce in Windows command line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstart /low syncthing.exe\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though the parent process priority is `Idle`, the child process priority gets changed to `Below normal`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/80912106-afe60980-8d75-11ea-9670-41ad43e497d3.png)\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, with `setLowPriority` set to `false`, the child process priority remains `Idle`, following its parent priority.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/80911954-a90ac700-8d74-11ea-9879-83e2419afef7.png)\r\n\r\nI would argue that `setLowPriority` should not make Syncthing change its priority to a higher value than the one already defined on runtime.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version:
