For instance:\r\n- `sysctl.conf` has `fs.inotify.max_user_watches = 204800`\r\n- directory (root folder) has `379320` directories (but only `103917` directories not ignored) and `1970011` files (but only `41029` files not ignored)\r\n\r\nIncreasing the inotify limit to 1M+ fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n## Questions/thoughts/ideas\r\n\r\n- does the inotify limit need to be higher than all directories (ignored + not ignored)?\r\n- is there a way to list all files/directories to be watched? This way, we could prevent this issue by determining a correct value before increasing it with random values (here `204800` as stated in the docs doesn't help). Or perhaps just give the information in the error: `inotify limit was hit, XXX directories are to be watched (see ...)`.\r\n- using `strace`, I've seen a lot of calls to `inotify_rm_watch`. I don't understand why? Is it because I've reached the inotify limit? After increasing the limit, there's no more calls.\r\n- hitting the inotify limit should be reported as `INFO` or `WARNING` in the logs. I've searched a lot before understanding why my files were not in sync, enabling verbose helped a lot, because the message was clear: inotify issue (+ link to how to deal with the issue).\r\n- I've used `sysctl -p` to update the limit right now, after editing `/etc/sysctl.conf`, perhaps it would be useful to update your docs for this very command, I think it's better as it uses the real configuration file (`/etc/sysctl.conf`), so no bad surprises on reboot.\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\nThank you for this tool, used alongside of Unison for other purposes, it's really great!\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v1.1.3\r\nOS Version: Debian stable (Stretch), using https://apt.syncthing.net/ repository\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5731/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5731/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
