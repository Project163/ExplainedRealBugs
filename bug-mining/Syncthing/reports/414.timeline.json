\n\nI am also using syncthing-inotify and is does a great job. But I can confirm the behavior regarding the sub parameter as mentioned above: Triggering the \".stfolder\" file in the root of a Folder (as periodically done by syncthing-inotify) causes a complete scan of the Folder. In case of a large Picture Library and a lot of xml/sqlite files (e.g., iPhoto-Library) this can take a long time and creates a lot of IO.\n\nIn syncthing/lib/model/model.go \"func (m *Model) internalScanFolderSubs(folder string, subs []string)\" \nonly the parent of sub is taken into account. Hence, triggering \".stfolder\" as sub causes a complete scan of the folder. Is that the desired behavior?\n\nAs workaround I created a \".stfolderInotify\" folder in each of my syncthing Folders and patched syncthing-inotify \n-                               callback(folder, []string{\".stfolder\"})\n-                               callback(folder, []string{\".stfolderInotify/.\"})\n  to trigger  \".stfolderInotify/.\" periodically.\n\nKind regards\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/170878354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fkwp","id":5071496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzE0OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5071496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkwp","html_url":"https://github.com/fkwp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkwp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkwp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkwp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkwp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkwp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkwp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkwp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkwp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fkwp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/170879999","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2151#issuecomment-170879999","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2151","id":170879999,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MDg3OTk5OQ==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-12T11:18:34Z","updated_at":"2016-01-12T11:18:34Z","body":"`.stfolder` is magic as it's ignored.
