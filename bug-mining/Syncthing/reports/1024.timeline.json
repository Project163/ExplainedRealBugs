Purpose\r\n\r\nSyncthing is now always run through a monitor process. Reasons found in #5786 and it also fixes #4774 as predicted there :)\r\n\r\nThis will lead to a >20% increase in reports to sentry (according to data.syncthing.net and assuming most apt/arch/fedora/... use some kind of service manager) and an initial spike of old reports, just in case that needs some precautionary measures.\r\n\r\nI also took the opportunity to add logging to the desktop entry (also tested to work).\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI manually tested the following that without `-no-restart` it restarts on ctrl-c in subshell, on restart in UI and on auto-update and it does not restart on shutdown in UI, and with `-no-restart` it doesn't restart in any of the aforementioned cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6278/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2961947820,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjk2MTk0NzgyMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2961947820","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-20T08:07:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2961947996,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5NjE5NDc5OTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2961947996","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"69da11a263f99104dc3e3e01abe0bcc792e3b1ca","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/69da11a263f99104dc3e3e01abe0bcc792e3b1ca","created_at":"2020-01-20T08:07:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2967061756,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5NjcwNjE3NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2967061756","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7ee903a55fac88fce5f03bb9bab2445e1a0eb117","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/calmh/syncthing/commits/7ee903a55fac88fce5f03bb9bab2445e1a0eb117","created_at":"2020-01-21T17:14:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2976329406,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDI5NzYzMjk0MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2976329406","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.g
