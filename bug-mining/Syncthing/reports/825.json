Syncthing is controlled through `systemd` and its configuration is managed with `ansible`. Every user account has its own instance of syncthing handling its files. All was great until I wanted to enable syncthing-inotify.\n\n```\nSep 21 06:36:24 staging syncthing-inotify[529]: [WARNING] Cannot connect to Syncthing: Get https://localhost:8384/rest/404: dial tcp [::1]:8384: getsockopt: connection refused\n```\n\nIt turns out services communicate with syncthing using the same channel as user's browsers. This means I cannot disable the GUI or I cannot enable any additional tool that talks to syncthing. I thought no problem, let's enable the GUI and mitigate the issue by only listening on a unix socket, which I can restrict access to through filesystem permissions. Alas, the GUI is hardcoded to use a tcp port.\n\nThus the feature request:\n1. allow dissociating API and GUI channels. Or at the very least start a stripped down version with just the API available.\n2. allow `unix://`-type address for GUI.\n\nI believe those would be great steps towards allowing syncthing to work flawlessly in a traditional daemon style.\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3616/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3616/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
