This lock can be held for quite a while (because stat:s and listdirs), and there can be a lot of routines waiting for that lock. This in turn blocks the `dropCache` method which wants the same lock, and is called from `(*caseFilesystemRegistry).cleaner()`. The `cleaner()` holds the `caseFilesystemRegistry` lock for the duration, which then blocks creating new filesystem instances.
