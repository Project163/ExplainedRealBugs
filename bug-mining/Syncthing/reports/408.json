Which should have been a strong signal that I was wrong. Now that we expose relaying and global discovery both in the settings interface, it makes sense for privacy conscious users to disable global discovery and change the relaying server to something they themselves control. This should work out of the box.\n\nIf a user disables global discovery but not relaying and uses the default relay setting, then they won't get relay connections as the devices can't find each other (as they disabled global discovery). This is a natural result of disabling global discovery I think.\n\n@AudriusButkevicius opinion?\n","closed_by":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2665/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
