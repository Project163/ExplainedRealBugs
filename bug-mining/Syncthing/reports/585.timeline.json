One reason they do this in torrenting IMHO: is that machines today have lots of memory and people are more and more prefer to \"leave stuff working quietly in the background\" rather \"exit and relaunch\".\r\n\r\nIn syncthing - a synchronization tool that mainly purposed to be used as \"always ON, in the background\" it would make even more sense in a way. If some large files are going through, choking everything else, to just slow it down for a while rather then exit, or set hard limits in the config \"forever\".\r\n\r\nNow as far as UI clutter goes, backend support for \"fast/slow\" toggle would do most of the work.
