What happened?\n\nOS Fedora 41 \r\nfolder to sync is a subfolder in user home containing some socket files of gpg agent (socket files mistakenly got there).\r\n\r\n\r\nsome other  files which were recently changed were randomly not synced until the socket files were removed. \r\n\r\nrescanning and restarting syncthing didn't help.\r\n\r\n\r\nafter removing the socket files the sync process sync all remaining files on 1st attempt.\r\n\r\n\r\nmy assumption is: when the socket files were accessed by the (not so randomly choosing) syncing process the syncing process crashed silently. \r\n\r\nthe missing files would have been accessed by the syncing process in the order after the  socket files. since the process crashed silently the files could not get synced. \r\n\r\n- just an assumption
