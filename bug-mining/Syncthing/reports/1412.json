Essential information about the authentication with the new login screen is not displayed to me. There is full access after authorization because I can, for example, reactivate Basic Auth via the GUI. Browser: Chrome 118. In Firefox the GUI doesn't even build completely, some JS restarts the build every few seconds. After activating http-basic-auth, the GUI works again as usual in Firefox.\r\n![2023-11-09_09-17](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/assets/33317545/eef74df0-6edc-4c59-b4ee-0f8b631142c7)\r\n![2023-11-09_09-18](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/assets/33317545/43729a65-9367-4b0b-82b1-14dd7a4a7037)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9208/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
