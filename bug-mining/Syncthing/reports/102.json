The files downloaded on PC B up until the the time of renaming the dir on PC A are left on the receiving PC B, but with the addition of the prefix \".syncthing.(filename)\". Refer to syslog excerpt below.\n\nTo re-produce:\n- Install v0.10.4 on two Ubuntu 14.10 PCs, PC A and PC B\n- Setup the 'default' dir share between A and B\n- On A, copy a dir called 'CAREER' (containing ~100MB files) into the Sync dir\n- While A is uploading to B, on A, rename 'CAREER' dir to change case to 'career' \n- Sync fails with issue described above\n\nHack to temporarily fix the sync process:\n-On B, `rm -rf CAREER` # (i.e. original name of dir that was renamed after sync started)\n\nRelevant excerpt from syslog:\nOct 29 00:50:45 xxx syncthing: [XUUME] 00:50:45 INFO: Puller (folder \"default\", dir \"CAREER\"): delete: remove /mnt/docs/Sync/CAREER: directory not empty\nOct 29 00:50:45 xxx syncthing: [XUUME] 00:50:45 WARNING: Folder \"default\" isn't making progress - check logs for possible root cause.
