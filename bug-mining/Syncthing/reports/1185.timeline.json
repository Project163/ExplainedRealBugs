Otherwise there's no benefit in making it centralized, you could also go for full mesh and have clients with e.g. 10/20 and servers with 200/250 (assuming a beafyness differential between clients and servers). I'd expect this to improve load-sharing over a centralized solution.\r\n\r\n> What exact \"metadata shuffling\" are we talking about? Which part of it doesn't scale?\r\n\r\nI think it's mainly index updates from every device for every item that changes across the cluster. There's some other stuff (download progress (which is also kind of indexy), remote paused folders, ...) but that's less problematic (not involving db).\r\n\r\n> [...] having randomly shuffled devices we connect to doesn't help, as over time we'll still hit most of them and store their index, so I am not sure what this really tries to solve.\r\n\r\nThat indeed reduces the effectiveness of the delta-index-machanism, probably by a lot if numC << totalDeviceNum. Might be alleviated by some mechanism to first try to connect to devices that have been previously connected, and only connect new devices if you can't reach `minC` otherwise. That will influence topology connection arguments though - which we haven't really dived into yet :) \r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/737875797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/738248726","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7176#issuecomment-738248726","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7176","id":738248726,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczODI0ODcyNg==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-03T19:38:17Z","updated_at":"2020-12-03T19:38:17Z","body":"So sure, accepting indexes is probably the most costly part of this, but how costly is it compared to the actual transfer?
