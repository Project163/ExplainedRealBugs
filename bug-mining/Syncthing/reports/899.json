When I click through to see the list of out of sync items it shows 7 files with the same name. They are all syncing and showing the exact same level of progress and they increment at the same time. On a second identical backup system there are 3 of the same file name shown.\r\n\r\nThere is only one copy of this file on the source computer with this name that should be syncing. The path shown for all 7 or all 3 are identical.\r\n\r\nEverything appears to be working as expected, this appears to be a display issue that I caught because the file is large and takes a long time to sync.\r\n\r\nIn case it provides a hint the backup system with 7 names in the list is on the LAN while the one with 3 names is remote and syncing at about half the rate.\r\n\r\nAll systems are running 0.14.52 on Linux. The source running Fedora 29, the two backup computers are running Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS on Odroid-HC2 computers.\r\n\r\n![syncthingduplicateitems](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9490727/48666816-2447c280-ea86-11e8-9aaf-96dfb999021d.png)\r\n\r\n![syncthingduplicateitems2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9490727/48666818-29a50d00-ea86-11e8-8095-fb8a80330221.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5332/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
