I logged in with my usual username and password. Instead of showing me the dashboard, the browser tab locks up with what looks like a redirect loop.\r\n\r\n**what you expected to happen instead**\r\n\r\nI expected to log in and be presented with the usual dashboard.\r\n\r\n**any steps to reproduce the problem**\r\n\r\nThis issue only seems to affect v1.26.0 when using Firefox to access the GUI. **Also** this issue only seems to get triggered if I am accessing a remote Syncthing GUI using the IP address of the remote host. (This issue does not occur when loading the local GUI via `localhost`.)\r\n\r\n**WORKAROUND**\r\n\r\nI've gone into the settings and set `sendBasicAuthPrompt` which allows me to access the dashboard via Firefox.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9210/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1805361164","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9208#issuecomment-1805361164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9208","id":1805361164,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAOCAEs5rm6AM","user":{"login":"keenwon","id":5516478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTY0Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5516478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenwon","html_url":"https://github.com/keenwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keenwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-10T09:16:48Z","updated_at":"2023-11-10T09:16:48Z","body":"I just experienced the same issue, and I fixed it by clearing cookies.

seems that after hibernating the OS and then resuming from hibernation later, Syncthing Tray stalls and stops updating the Syncthing state.

Hibernate Windows.\r\n3. After a while, resume the OS from hibernation.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nSyncthing Tray should refresh the Syncthing state after resuming the OS from hibernation following the poll intervals set in the configuration.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/Martchus/syncthingtray/assets/5626656/51d01f09-b237-406b-8b0d-1f2a94d523ec)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI have experienced the problem on two unrelated Windows devices.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Martchus/syncthingtray/issues/209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Martchus/syncthingtray/issues/209/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
