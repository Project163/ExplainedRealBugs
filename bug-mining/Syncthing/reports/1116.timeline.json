just realized the same problem exists in `removeFromGlobal`. However thinking a bit more about it, why do we include receive-only changed items in the global count in the first place? That seems completely wrong to me: The global state is what everyone agrees upon. Receive-only changed items are the complete antithesis to that. If we didn't add it to the global state, receive-only items would lead to a higher local than global state, which seems right. It also removes the need for the workaround added in #6852. Thus I propose to not add invalid items to the global state.

Purpose\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6850#issuecomment-665031731:  \r\n> [...] why do we include receive-only changed items in the global count in the first place? That seems completely wrong to me: The global state is what everyone agrees upon. Receive-only changed items are the complete antithesis to that. If we didn't add it to the global state, receive-only items would lead to a higher local than global state, which seems right. It also removes the need for the workaround added in #6852. Thus I propose to not add invalid items to the global state. \r\n\r\nThis behaviour also fixes #6850, and in addition to the previous fix (which is reverted here) covers removing items from the global state as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/665125230","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6850#issuecomment-665125230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6850","id":665125230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NTEyNTIzMA==","user":{"login":"tomasz1986","id":5626656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjY2NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5626656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasz1986","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-28T15:58:08Z","updated_at":"2020-07-28T16:04:11Z","body":"I hope it is OK to write here instead of the forum, as this has just come to my mind while reading the @imsodin's message. I had a problem when my Receive Only folder was in a \"Revert Local Changes\" state, i.e. after deleting some files locally. Without pressing the red button, I changed the folder type from \"Receive Only\" to \"Send & Receive\". However, Syncthing would still not push the local deletions to the other device, and the folder itself was marked \"Up to Date\", even though some of the files were missing from it.\r\n\r\nThe scenario is basically this:\r\n\r\n1. Send Only folder on Device A. Receive Only folder on Device B. Everything is in sync.\r\n2. Delete files on Device B. Receive Only folder is now marked \"Local Additions\".\r\n3. Change both folders to \"Send & Receive\".\r\n4. Both Device A and B marked \"Up to Date\", but the deleted files are not pushed to Device A.\r\n\r\nIs this somewhat related, or a completely different
