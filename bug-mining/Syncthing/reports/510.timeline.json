And part of the problem is that CommitConfiguration calls all these things synchronously and locked, and they must all return before the config becomes unlocked etc. This is all to set the \"must restart\" flag, which is also a bit buggy - it only gets set when the config is changed through the JSON push, but we also update the config internally with SetDevice and so on.\n\nOne option here could be to remove the return value from CommitConfiguration, and run those asynchronously from the Wrapper. No locking, no waiting for the commit to complete. We could track the need to restart in some other way, and that should hopefully go away with time. It might even be a push in that
