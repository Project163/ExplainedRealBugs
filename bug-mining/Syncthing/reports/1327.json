But some tagging engines for Linux (such as Baloo, former Nepomuk from KDE) stores metainformation (tags, comments, ratings etc.) exactly in xattrs, therefore this metainfo are not synchronized across the cluster. Maybe is possible to add optional feature to sync xattrs across nodes, if file system supports it?\n\nSome (possibly) related articles:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_file_attributes#Linux\nhttps://community.kde.org/Baloo/Architecture\n\nP.S.
