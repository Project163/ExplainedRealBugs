This involves parsing and compiling the ignore patterns. If there are a lot of patterns that can be expensive. If running with syncthing-inotify we might get a lot of scan requests.\n\nWe should just check the .stignore file timestamp and not do anything unless it's changed.\n\nIt's a mystery to me why we don't already do this. I must have been drunk when I wrote this (or reviewed it, if someone else is responsible.
