It's a minor annoyance to me but the confusion could in theory result in someone giving the wrong device / person access to their files.\n\n![syncthing_zoomed-out-firefox_rendering-problem](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19378/5638065/40d8ab56-95fa-11e4-9ec4-5699e18aee31.png)\n\nThe float bootstrap adds to checkboxes and radio buttons is taking them out of the flow, so it no longer causes the containing div to provide enough height to allow the elements to sit on top of each other correctly without interfering with each-other.\n\nThe effect is exacerbated by 3-col layout in use causing the UI elements to scatter.\n\nHere's a screenshot with the 3-cols disabled to clearly show the staggered effect of the floats when combined with zooming out on firefox:\n\n![syncthing_inspect-floated-checkbox_cols-disabled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19378/5638124/08b08748-95fb-11e4-8720-40b151f0d852.png)\n\nI should probably mention I'm on linux mint 17.1 as I think the widgets are different depending on the OS in use. Syncthing v 0.10.17\n\nHope that's helpful. I suggest using the overrides.css to disable the float as follows (I'll do a pull request for convenience in a moment).\n\n```\n.checkbox input[type=\"checkbox\"], .radio input[type=\"radio\"] {\n    float: none;\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1197/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
