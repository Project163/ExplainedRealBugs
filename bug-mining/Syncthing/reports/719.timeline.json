However, a device will leak information to its peers on what other devices it is interested in, which I supposed you could mitigate by instead querying for hash(device id + timestamp). Also if you have A <--> B <--> C, where A and C know about a fourth device D (but B doesn't), A and C can't share information on D's address.\r\n\r\nAnother way is, whenever a device retrieves an address from the global discovery servers (or announces its own address to the global discovery servers), it announces it to all of its peers, as a [hash(device id + timestamp), encrypt(address, device id)] tuple. Devices then relay this to their peers, being careful to avoid cycles. If a device sees an entry for a device it is interested in, it resets its timeout for polling the global discovery servers, and adds a minute or so of extra time (to avoid all devices in a network racing and hitting the global discovery servers simultaneously after the timeout).\r\n\r\nNote of course that this all falls down if you don't trust your peers to give you correct information.\r\n\r\n(All of this is orthogonal to the work around K/V stores, of course, but potentially still relevant to making global discovery more scalable, by reducing load on it).\r\n  ","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/354993555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"canton7","id":568104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODEwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7","html_url":"https://github.com/canton7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/355109640","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4618#issuecomment-355109640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4618","id":355109640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTEwOTY0MA==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-03T19:53:02Z","updated_at":"2018-01-03T20:10:26Z","body":"It's relevant and we should do it, yet orthogonal to the issue of still scaling the remaining global discovery. For what it's worth I've done a decent amount of actual engineering on this today, experimenting on discovery-v[46]-4, and noticed a few things.\r\n\r\n- I've tweaked the Retry-After and Reannounce-After headers so that devices reannounce after one hour (unless something changes), and hold off on asking for a device for five minutes when it gets a 404 response. This reduces the amount of requests somewhat.\r\n\r\n- DigitalOcean Spaces are limited to 200 requests/s which is nowhere near the capacity we need, regardless of whether we do the requests ourselves or plan to let the clients look things up there directly.\r\n\r\n- etcd seems like a nice distributed KV store so I wrote up support for that and deployed in on a triple of 2GB/2CPU boxes on DO. Unfortunately it didn't really scale with our use case and there aren't any relevant tunables:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"646\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-01-03 at 10 33 15\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125426/34537418-a1c8fb92-f0c8-11e7-818a-f7c930305105.png\">\r\n\r\n- Technologically, Amazon DynamoDB is also decent fit for a backend KV-store and we wouldn't need to worry about how it scales. I wrote up support for that and deployed a triple of t2.medium machines as frontends. Those were able to handle the load nicely, to begin with, and the DB scales up to the required read/write performance. Unfortunately the required read/write performance comes at a $150/month level, the three t2.medium instances aren't exactly free, and after a while they got throttled down to 20% of their initial CPU rate by Amazon. I guess I was in some sort of burst mode just after deployment.\r\n\r\n- Rethinking this I realized that the data isn't really valuable enough to keep in a separate KV store and we should just try the simplest thing possible. To this end I rewrote the discosrv backend to just be a RAM-backed map and added replication - just duplicating updates to a preconfigured set of peers so we can load balance.\r\n\r\nThe latter is now deployed on DO again, on a pair of high-cpu boxes (again, expensive). They are humming along very nicely though so we will be able to scale them down a bit.\r\n\r\nI also added some relevant metrics. One thing is that we get about 150 announcements/s, and these are expensive as they check the client certificate and stuff. Out of these, about 100 are re-announces where just the KCP address has changed, from 0.14.40 boxes. Since these addresses change every 24 seconds, 100/(1/24) corresponds to 2400 devices which is about how many 0.14.40 boxes are still out there according to data.s.n. I think one of the major connectivity issues in 0.14.40 that was still there in 0.14.41 was just that the global disco servers were totally DoSed...\r\n\r\nWhen this abates we should be able to turn down the boxes to a cheaper config, and then just add smaller boxes or upgrade them one by one as load increases over time.\r\n\r\nI've given up on being able to offload the TLS termination to someone else.\r\n
