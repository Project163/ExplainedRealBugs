These appear to be for cases where we've split a long directory name by adding slashes to avoid max filename length issues.\r\n\r\nThat is, a short directory on disk might be represented as `0.syncthing-enc/AB/CDEFGH` and that's handled. A longer one might be `0.syncthing-enc/AB/CDEFGH...XYZ/ASDFG` and in this case the intermediate directory is considered unexpected.\r\n\r\nA practical problem here is that we can't actually look at any given directory in isolation and draw any conclusions about whether it's unexpected or not, because it might be just part of a longer file or directory name. Perhaps we should let any and all directories slide, as long as they are under a `?.syncthing-enc` top level directory, and just react to files that can't be properly mapped.\r\n\r\n(Or maybe just let any unexpected things be there and be ignored... Keeping in mind that just opening an encrypted dir in a file browser is likely to litter it with .DS_Store and other crap on mac, possible similar stuff on other platforms...)\r\n\r\n(`v1.12.1-dev.41.gc1b452df`)","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
