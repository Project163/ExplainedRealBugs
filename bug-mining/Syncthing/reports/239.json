managed to reproduce this weird case where UPnP does not work.\nFired up wireshark, and I can see discovery packets leaving, but I cannot see UPnP MSEARCH packets leaving my machine.\n\nI changed the broadcast address to something else within my subnet, and it starts working, meaning that either Go or Windows doesn't like the address.\n\nGiven I ran a different UPnP utility and it works, it makes me think there is something wrong with Go's
