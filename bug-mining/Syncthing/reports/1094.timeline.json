implemented a prototype to restructure the global list to save a list of versions, and devices that have that version, instead of one long list of devices (duplicating lots of versions). I didn't fully consider the implications of a change in the proto structures: It means unmarshalling global lists now fails with the new code on old databases, and that can happen during a few of the old transitions. One option is to convert to the new format before all the existing transitions, but that obviously might have unintended side-effects. A second one is duplicating a lot of code using the old proto types just for db transitions. A (possible) third to reimplement existing transitions doing \"everything by hand\", i.e. direct db interaction not using methods like `updateGlobal` (we should probably always do that in future transitions). And a fourth to make a hard version break without db transitions. But the gain of this change seems quite small compared to such a cost. I'll look into the feasibility of options 1-3 tomorrow - any general thoughts on it?\r\n\r\nThe new structures are:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/lib/db/structs.proto b/lib/db/structs.proto\r\nindex 1acbaaee..f3a8ac2b 100644\r\n--- a/lib/db/structs.proto\r\n+++ b/lib/db/structs.proto\r\n@@ -13,14 +13,15 @@ option (gogoproto.goproto_unrecognized_all) = false;\r\n option (gogoproto.goproto_sizecache_all) = false;\r\n \r\n message FileVersion {\r\n-    protocol.Vector version = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];\r\n-    bytes           device  = 2;\r\n-    bool            invalid = 3;\r\n+    protocol.Vector version         = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];\r\n+    repeated bytes  devices         = 2;\r\n+    repeated bytes  invalid_devices = 3;\r\n }\r\n \r\n message VersionList {\r\n     option (gogoproto.goproto_stringer) = false;\r\n-    repeated FileVersion versions = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];\r\n+    repeated FileVersion versions         = 1 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];\r\n+    repeated FileVersion invalid_versions = 2 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];\r\n }\r\n \r\n // Must be the same as FileInfo but without the blocks field\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe invalid handling might seem a bit random: It's due to the fact that now a version can be mixed between invalid and valid entries or have just invalid ones. Currently we just sort invalid devices behind valid ones, and that distinction is now no longer there -> account them separately. I'll try to write it up better later when I have more time (and found solution to the practicalities)

The branch lives on top of PR https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/pull/6635, so that's the first thing to happen.  \r\nhttps://github.com/imsodin/syncthing/tree/indirectversions\r\n\r\nOne high-level bit for feedback without jumping into the deep end are db migrations:    \r\nThey needed a fair bit of code duplication and adjustments to the 0to1 migration. Everything starting with line 751 are old methods: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/compare/master...imsodin:indirectversions#diff-59e58e2c68f4fbad47386d8ccbaee68cR751  \r\nI haven't looked into Jakobs suggestion above to convert global lists on load and using \"the new global list handling\" for the old migrations. Given the current amount of duplication, do you think it is worth investing time to give that a try?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/627890332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3331555774,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMzMzE1NTU3NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/3331555774","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"aad7b8a0761434d34e8faf0b108244f3c53c5a96","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imsodin/syncthing/commits/aad7b8a0761434d34e8faf0b108244f3c53c5a96","created_at":"2020-05-13T11:12:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3332562972,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMzMzI1NjI5NzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/3332562972","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"93b37b20705d897a51c9a93d849e7fa54a1b168d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imsodin/syncthing/commits/93b37b20705d897a51c9a93d849e7fa54a1b168d","created_at":"2020-05-13T15:10:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
