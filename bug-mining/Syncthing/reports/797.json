@calmh This is yet another issue introduced in https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/pull/4958 and thus 0.14.49 material - I am really sorry about that disaster and slow piece-by-piece resolution. It also needs another db transition while there is already one on master, that's not in release - I will file separate PRs for master and release branches to address that. Regarding release schedules: May it be reasonable to delay 0.14.50, but already release 0.14.51-rc.1 as normal?\r\n\r\nOriginally came up in https://forum.syncthing.net/t/did-something-recently-changed-in-ignores-handling/11714/35\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Share a folder between devices A and B.\r\n2. Modify file F on A, wait for sync.\r\n3. Modify file F on B, wait for sync.\r\n4. Ignore F on A.\r\n5. Edit F on A and B.\r\n6.
