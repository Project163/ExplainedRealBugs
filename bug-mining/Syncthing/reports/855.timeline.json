understand that rationale, but from the moment one can disable normal rescans via the 0 interval, then Syncthing is not monitoring the folder anyway - anything can happen to it and Syncthing won't know. From that perspective, if the user disabled rescanning it, then it should apply to startup also. There's always manual scanning available if need be.\nPicture 10 TB folders which are only used as mirrors ('write only') and having to rescan them with every restart for no gain. The only useful scan is on creation, because the user may have initialized the folder with a copy of the remote contents, but all subsequent ones are of no use (unless some problem comes up, but for that there's manual rescan).

wit, afaict there are 3 types of scans. **For the specific case I'm thinking of (mirroring):**\n- On creating the folder. It makes no sense to disable this one because Syncthing does have to initialise its knowledge of the local contents:\n  - if the folder is created empty, then the scan wont take long anyway\n  - if the folder is pre-populated then Syncthing has to know what's already there\n- Regularly, according to the rescan interval. It is currently possible to disable this altogether based on our knowledge of the fact that the folder should not change. But it's possible that changes are made. Syncthing won't know about them. If the user knows about the changes and wants them to be taken into account, they can do a manual rescan,.\n- On Syncthing startup. Every folder is rescanned. My opinion is that all the reasons behind allowing  the 0 interval to disable rescanning also apply here, so it should be possible to disable scanning a folder on startup. It could be a consequence of the 0 interval, it could be a separate setting, whatever. \n\nOf course, in a pro server environment, Syncthing is hardly ever restarted, but 1. then those folders don't ever get rescanned anyway, 2. Syncthing is so good/empowering that it's being successfully used in plenty of amateur environments.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/181020779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"entonio","id":5048472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDg0NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5048472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/entonio","html_url":"https://github.com/entonio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entonio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entonio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entonio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entonio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entonio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entonio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entonio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entonio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/entonio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/181022383","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2760#issuecomment-181022383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2760","id":181022383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTAyMjM4Mw==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-07T14:29:22Z","updated_at":"2016-02-07T14:29:33Z","body":"So
