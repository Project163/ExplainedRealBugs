I could not open the log anymore. Because of that I stopped Syncthing, deleted the log and started Syncthing again. Now I could see that the following messages was repeated very very often:\r\n[FCKL4] 09:47:49 INFO: Couldn't fetch release information: Get https://upgrades.syncthing.net/meta.json: dial tcp 46.101.130.230:443: connectex: Der Zugriff auf einen Socket war aufgrund der Zugriffsrechte des Sockets unzulässig.\r\n\r\nA few weeks or months ago I disabled automatic upgrades by setting autoUpgradeIntervalH to zero. After I changed the value to 999999 and restarted Syncthing the problem was gone.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
