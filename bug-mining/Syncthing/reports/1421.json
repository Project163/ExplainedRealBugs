Both systems are members of a domain. \r\nThe sync completes and all looks good, there are no errors or warnings in the log. Ownership and permissions of user and group get synced totally fine.\r\n\r\nBut after a rescan ALL Files are marked as local additions. If i disable “sync ownership” all works as expected and we do not have that problem. \r\n\r\nTested that with a new testfolder with only a few files in it and was able to replicate the behaviour.\r\n\r\nI excluded the mac-folder from spotilight search and experimented with some settings like setting “modTimeWindowS” but that did not solve it.\r\n\r\nI dont see a change in the files, there are no extended attributes set and the timestamp of the files does not change after the sync.\r\n\r\nCorresponding Syncthing forum post: \r\nhttps://forum.syncthing.net/t/sync-from-linux-to-mac-with-ownership-local-additions-after-rescan/20673/1 ","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9039/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
