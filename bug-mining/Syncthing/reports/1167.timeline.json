The protocol has always been about more than just the Syncthing implementation, and even we stray from that ideal now and then adding a specific GUI address field to it is going too far.\r\n\r\nIf you do remote administration of devices I think it’s reasonable to expect you to know what port you have the GUI on, while the IP might plausibly change now and then. Being able to add a port to the config and have the GUI generate a link feels roughly on par with being able to give the device a name of your choosing - a local decision for convenience.
