E.g. If Syncthing-inotify performs `scan?folder=default&sub=foo/bar&sub=foo/bar2` because the files `bar` and `bar2` are removed, the file count is reduced by 3 instead of 2. I traced it back to the fact that we use a [`batch`](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/29fa05ae0580e9a707171af7f0b00de6b92a5be8/lib/model/model.go#L1486) array instead of a map, which means the array we pass to updateLocals can contain duplicates. This confuses the intermediate counting we do in sizeTracker.\n\nThis could cause a panic: in [set.go](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/29fa05ae0580e9a707171af7f0b00de6b92a5be8/lib/db/set.go#L84)\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3028/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3028/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
