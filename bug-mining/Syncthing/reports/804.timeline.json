\r\n\r\nWhy asserting/panicing is a good question - it makes life easy for me as I don't need to think about how to handle a case that should never happen. A panic is ideal for that, as one line of code guarantees that the issue will come to my attention if it ever arises. Obviously, it's not quite user-friendly. All of that is tangential to your actual case though.\r\n\r\nWhat needs figuring out is where the evaluation of symlinks in your filesystem instance failed, i.e. why there is this conflict:\r\n\r\npanic: bug: Notify backend is processing a change outside of the filesystem root: root==/home/piotr/storage/synced/oneplus5/, **rootSymEval==/home/piotr/storage/synced/oneplus5/**, path==/mnt/storage/storage/synced/oneplus5/.stfolder\r\n\r\nfmt.Println(filepath.EvalSymlinks(\"/home/piotr/storage/synced/oneplus5/\"))\r\n**/mnt/storage/storage/synced/oneplus5** <nil>\r\n\r\nI can't reproduce this issue, so a bit of back and forth will be necessary (maybe I am also just missing the obvious).
