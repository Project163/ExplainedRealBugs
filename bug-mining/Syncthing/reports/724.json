I think we should do that as well, with an off switch.\r\n\r\n- New config option: `options.setLowPriority` which defaults to `true`\r\n- When this option is true, at startup, we:\r\n  - On Unixes, set our niceness to 9.\r\n  - On Windows, set priority class PROCESS_MODE_BACKGROUND_BEGIN\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to also set I/O priority on Linux, but honestly the `ioprio_set` API is annoying to use from Go and I'm not going there at this point.\r\n\r\n@canton7 any concerns here for you? You wanted to know what the outcome became, and you already set something by default?\r\n\r\nWe might want to take care to not *raise* our priority as part of this, though, by checking if the original priority is default or not. But on the other hand I think that on at least Unixes it's not possible for the process to raise its own priority so this comes automatically.","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4628/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
