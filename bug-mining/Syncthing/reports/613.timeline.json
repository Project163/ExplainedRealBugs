I implemented an ignore pattern for symlinks and it worked, my remote machine is no longer 'Out of Sync'. But there is one odd thing. The local machine that contains all the symlinks states a value of 7732 files under the 'Local State' in the UI. If I ignore a regular file that number will adjust, but when I added the ignore pattern for the symlinks that number doesn't change (I thought it'd go down by 97.) So the 'Local State' on the machine isn't counting the symlinks (whether there's an ignore pattern for them or not) but it obviously is sending the names of the symlinks (when there isn't an ignore pattern) to the remote machine (as the remote machine was previously complaining about the symlinks.) So until I was able to access the remote machine I didn't know if the ignore pattern for the symlinks was
