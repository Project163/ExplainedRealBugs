Purpose\r\n\r\nScenario (https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7474#issuecomment-798881296):\r\n\r\n> The reason is that we have an \"efficiency\" measure: We do not pull items that are not present at all locally and globally invalid or deleted. B sees valid items from A, thus their global is valid. C only sees invalid items from B, thus their global is invalid and they don't pull. B doesn't know about C's global, thus shows C as out of sync. The fix here is to always pull invalid files (\"pull\" as in create a local invalid entry too).\r\n\r\nI adjusted `Need` to consider invalid files needed, and added a shortcut to the puller to send invalid files directly to the db. If at some point we do create a local file, that \"trumps\" the invalid file as usual (bumps the version of the invalid file, uninvalidates it, ...).\r\n\r\nI also added a db migration to trigger a repair, otherwise the changes don't take effect.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nUnit test checking that we do pull and send back an invalid file info.  \r\nNeeded to add some machinery to the fake connection to correctly send invalid files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7476/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4456824297,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDQ1NjgyNDI5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4456824297","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"273ee09925b571f6c0f70338c1d27651de4f1506","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/273ee09925b571f6c0f70338c1d27651de4f1506","created_at":"2021-03-15T06:58:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4457294580,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ1NzI5NDU4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4457294580","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-15T08:47:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4457294584,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0NTcyOTQ1ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4457294584","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-15T08:47:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4468729528,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQ0Njg3Mjk1Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4468729528","actor":{"login":"st-release","id":14043830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDQzODMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14043830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release","html_url":"https://github.com/st-release","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/

the solution for #7474 implemented in #7476 created a new, more severe problem: Files that should be synced, aren't: #7608. I couldn't come up with a way to fix #7474 without introducing this regression that doesn't add a lot of complexity. Thus I reverted that change and thus re-introduce #7474. As that is only a \"presentation issue\" that's clearly the more desirable issue to have.\r\n\r\nMost of the diff here is due to the migration needed to resolve issues for users already affected by #7608. As I needed a file info batch in this migration, I moved the `fileInfoBatch` from model to db.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI introduced a new unit test reproducing #7608 and removed the test for #7474.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7609/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4664984759,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQ0NjY0OTg0NzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4664984759","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-29T20:04:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4664985153,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50NDY2NDk4NTE1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4664985153","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-29T20:04:13Z","label":{"name":"needs-triage","color":"ce23af"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/829559727","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7474#issuecomment-829559727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7474","id":829559727,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTU1OTcyNw==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-29T20:04:40Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T20:04:40Z","body":"Not easy to fix, it turns out.

with subfolders and sub-sub-folders on all 3 devices\r\n- disconnect one device\r\n- remove 1 device\r\n- you now have; 1 connected device and 1 disconected device\r\n- from the connected device copy the folder structure to a new device which was never connected.\r\n- remove sub-sub-folder from the currently connected device and add it to the ignore list\r\n- add the new device with the old folder

What happened?\r\n\r\nIgnored directories are reported as out of sync between my 3 devices (2 workstations and a server), resulting in \"Syncing\" never being 100% which is important for me to check whether all the devices are synced. All directories are reported as \"Up to Date\", including the relevant sync directory with the ignored patterns below.\r\n\r\nI have an .stignore file with the following:\r\n\r\n    // Whitelisted

firefox/.firefox-template-profile\r\n\r\n\r\nAcross my devices, they all report out of sync for *at least* one of the following entries (all directories) and it is seemingly random (sometimes all of them are out of sync, sometimes only 1 of them):\r\n\r\n    firefox/.firefox-template-profile/.mozilla \t128 B\r\n    firefox/.firefox-template-profile/.mozilla/firefox \t128 B\r\n    firefox/.firefox-template-profile/.mozilla/firefox/main \t128 B\r\n\r\nI tried a combination of `--reset-deltas` and removing the contents of the sync dir and starting a full sync again but would like a more formal debugging process.\r\n\r\nIf anyone also has a workaround for using the API to consider the devices as 100% synced excluding the entries above, that would also be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Syncthing version\r\n\r\nv.1.28\r\n\r\n### Platform & operating
