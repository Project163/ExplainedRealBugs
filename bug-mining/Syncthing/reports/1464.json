As of v1.29.0 the routes return fields starting with an upper-case character like `Time` and `ReceiveEncrypted`. This is probably an unintended side-effect of the refactoring again.\r\n\r\nThis time it also affects the GUI, e.g. one gets a message like `some-device wants to share folder \"\" (stt-test-2). Add new folder?` where the folder label is missing. (The message is displayed correctly when it is shown while the page has already been opened. So the response from the corresponding event API is probably not affected.)\n\n### Syncthing version\n\nv1.29.0\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nall\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9907/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9907/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
