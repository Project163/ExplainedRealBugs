I created a new folder, set the watcher delay to `0`, and then ran a piece of software inside it that creates and modifies thousands of files very quickly. As expected, Syncthing was picking up the changes almost immediately as they were taking place. I didn't experience any extraordinary resource usage though (on Ryzen 4350G with a mid-range SSD). The Web GUI was indeed going a little crazy, changing the folder status back and forth almost constantly.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, would it bring any harm if a value of `0` was simply allowed for special cases like the one described here? Syncthing already allows much more dangerous custom configuration (e.g. disable fsync, etc.). There is no danger in this one except for potentially higher resource usage, right?\r\n\r\n**Edit**:\r\n\r\nThere is also this part of the code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/37d0ba16603a71f15b5ebdc8485d3bc0de65615c/lib/watchaggregator/aggregator.go#L456-L473\r\n\r\nCurrently, with the shortest possible watch delay of `1`, the deletion delay is `6`, right?
