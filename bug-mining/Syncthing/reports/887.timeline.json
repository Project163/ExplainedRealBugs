Maybe I am explaining stuff that's obvious to you all, but it wasn't to me and is relevant to the change I outlined above:  \r\nFlushing a `Batch` does not mean flushing to disk. It's purpose is to accumulate multiple changes into one atomic change. When flushed they get written to a db stage in memory, which in turn gets flushed to disk when exceeding `leveldb.Options.WriteBuffer`. To improve disk performance we'd need to tweak leveldb options like mem buffer size and level base size and multipliers, not primarily think about when to flush batches. The main reason to choose when to flush batches should be keeping the committed data consistent, performance is secondary.  \r\nBasically, the short version of the above is: The proposed change will probably have a small impact on disk performance if at all, however it's still the right thing to do in my opinion.\r\n\r\n> Maybe take a peek at that Dump() to see what it does; if it just returns an existing slice that’s great.\r\n\r\nAlready checked that, it's exactly what it does.\r\n\r\n> I recommend time limit; e.g. flush every second. That would reduce LSM tree torture a lot when doing initial scanning (possibly some large byte limit additionally, but usually amount of changes you can accumulate per second is limited).\r\n\r\nI doubt that limit would hit In practice: We already batch updates passed to Syncthing's db package, which will be flushed at the latest once fully processed - I wouldn't expect processing one batch to take more than a second.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/463592922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/463615365","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5531#issuecomment-463615365","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5531","id":463615365,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2MzYxNTM2NQ==","user":{"login":"fingon","id":1126063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjYwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1126063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fingon","html_url":"https://github.com/fingon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fingon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fingon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fingon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fingon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fingon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fingon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fingon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fingon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fingon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-14T12:49:44Z","updated_at":"2019-02-14T12:49:44Z","body":"The intent was to limit number of batches to one per second.

that would have to happen on the model side of things, were we currently batch at a fixed limit of 1000 items per batch (or earlier based on size). That's coming from sending indexes, which is probably not ideal for committing to database.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know the difference of batch writes to transactions for leveldb?  \r\nThey look very similar to me and the goleveldb documentation doesn't help me (https://godoc.org/github.com/syndtr/goleveldb/leveldb) and I don't find anything for leveldb (as a matter of fact, I don't find any documentation for that). My current understanding from this issue leading to the creation of transactions in goleveldb (https://github.com/syndtr/goleveldb/issues/129) is, that transactions somehow \"bypass a step\" (no idea what the \"step\" actually is).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/463777974/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/463783514","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5531#issuecomment-463783514","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5531","id":463783514,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Mzc4MzUxNA==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-14T20:32:18Z","updated_at":"2019-02-14T20:32:18Z","body":"Ping

is a new take at the PR #4980: I simplified it by dropping all the dynamic memory usage limiting and replaced it with a configurable limit per object. I'd still prefer a global limit based on available system memory, but I get that's too many moving parts/too much complexity. One option would be to set the default value to something like a percent of the system memory instead of  the current 16MB.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5673/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3040721038,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMwNDA3MjEwMzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/3040721038","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-15T07:02:27Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3040721043,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MzA0MDcyMTA0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/3040721043","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-15T07:02:28Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
