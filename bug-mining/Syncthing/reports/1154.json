This (`sendFullIndexOnUpgrade=true`) used to be the behavior in previous versions, but is mainly useful as a troubleshooting step and causes high database churn. The new default is `false`.","creator":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":36,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-15T17:43:50Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T10:11:12Z","due_on":"2020-11-03T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T10:11:12Z"},"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-10-15T18:03:13Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T07:02:41Z","closed_at":"2020-10-21T06:26:13Z","author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"Related to https://forum.syncthing.net/t/folders-up-to-date-but-stuck-in-syncing-with-empty-out-of-sync-items/15667.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create and share an empty folder between 3 devices - A, B, and C. \r\n2. Add a few large files to the folder on A.\r\n3. While the files are still being pushed from A to B and C, shut Syncthing down on A.\r\n5. Restart Syncthing on A.\r\n6. Wait for the previously interrupted synchronisation to finish.\r\n7. C is stuck trying to sync the files to B, but they exist there already.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/96167973-14c7a180-0f5b-11eb-89a4-7bc34b2dc7db.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/96167983-1729fb80-0f5b-11eb-95e1-98916c717a51.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/96167996-198c5580-0f5b-11eb-9a01-7c85d743bc28.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/96168427-afc07b80-0f5b-11eb-8837-c25fa79bacf8.png)","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7036/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
