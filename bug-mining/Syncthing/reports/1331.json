Apparently tmpfs does support xattrs, but not user extended ones:\r\n\r\n> The tmpfs filesystem supports extended attributes (see [xattr(7)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/xattr.7.html)),\r\n> but user extended attributes are not permitted.\r\n\r\nLooks like the random attrs we write in that test are such an extend user attributes. I don't really know much about xattrs, so not sure if this warrants a wider or more elegant fix. A quick fix would be to check for \"operation not supported\" string in the test and skip too.  \r\nI'd assume the quick fix is fine, as getting errors if one activates syncing xattrs on a tmpfs or otherwise unsupported FS seems correct. What do you think @calmh ?\r\n\r\n(Also bit confused CI didn't catch this - thought `/tmp` on tmpfs is pretty standard.)","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8564/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
