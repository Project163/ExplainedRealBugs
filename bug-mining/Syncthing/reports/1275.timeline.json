That would of course remain in place for all who don't care about a shortcut.\r\nBut for those who do notice the shortcut, it could be a nice touch. Thus, I find the risk of inconsistency or confusion very low, because the two cases remain clearly distinct. Just one of them get's a shortcut.\r\n\r\nAbout zooming: Do you think it scales better than a shortcut?\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the [stats `Number of Folders`](https://data.syncthing.net/), I gather that power-users with more folders (more `Edit` buttons slipping below the screen edge) would need to zoom out farther and farther, and that is limited by font size, isn't it?\r\n\r\nMy example is a bit simple maybe, but: At 100% in Chrome on my 800p screen, only the 1st to 4th folder panel is fully visible if expanded. At the same time, the `reduced` label is visible down to the 7th. That's 75% more folders whose ignore rules would be more conveniently accessible for users above some %ile between the 50th and 95th (maybe 60th %ile). Yeah, it's not a big leap forward, but then again: who doesn't need it can ignore it.\r\n\r\nAlso, as I said initially, one alternative GUI idea would be to make an expanding folder panel keep itself above the fold entirely.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/321302107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"katrinleinweber","id":9948149,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDgxNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9948149?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber","html_url":"https://github.com/katrinleinweber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katrinleinweber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/321304628","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4293#issuecomment-321304628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4293","id":321304628,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTMwNDYyOA==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-09T16:14:33Z","updated_at":"2017-08-09T16:14:33Z","body":"So anyways, I am against this, as we are solving your specific small screen problem.

don't think the Syncthing UI is a train wreck. Than again I would say that, I'm responsible for most of it. What I do think is that the dialogs are somewhat atrocious. There will always be a certain amount of scrolling on small screens, but we don't necessarily need to make that worse by having shaded background and margins and rounded corners take up literally half the screen. I think we can improve things in small steps by adding more full page dialogs and potentially top level tabs, without having to redesign the whole UI. That's something of a side track though. But it goes against the broken window \"the UI is anyway trash so no point in improving it\" feeling.\r\n\r\nMaking this a \"Reduced by <a>ignore patterns</a>\" thing with the ignore patterns being a link to the editor doesn't seem like it adds significant amount of clutter, to me, and seems like it could be a useful enhancement. The ignore patterns are hidden a couple of levels into the edit dialogs after all.\r\n\r\nIt's somewhat analogous to how we provide links for errors and in progress items from the folder status screen.\r\n\r\nAnyway, musings from the beach. A non-horrible pull request would likely be merged by me.
