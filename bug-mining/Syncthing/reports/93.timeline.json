If I had known the first thing about go, I would have been able to fix that myself. Really must learn.\n\nRegarding distributing binaries. OpenBSD binaries have a very limited shelf life. As soon as a base library bumps (libc and libpthread in this case), it will not run. Libraries are bumped frequently. You could distribute a binary for each release, but many OpenBSD users run rolling snapshots.\n\nI thought perhaps I had heard that go libraries were statically linked, but I guess not:\n\n```\n$ ldd ./bin/syncthing \n./bin/syncthing:\n        Start            End              Type Open Ref GrpRef Name\n        0000000000400000 0000000000d50000 exe  1    0   0      ./bin/syncthing\n        0000000281c65000 0000000282077000 rlib 0    2   0      /usr/lib/libpthread.so.18.1\n        000000021b14b000 000000021b635000 rlib 0    1   0      /usr/lib/libc.so.77.2\n        00000002e6c00000 00000002e6c00000 rtld 0    1   0      /usr/libexec/ld.so\n```\n\nAnyway, thanks for your help. I'm going to have a play with this today :)\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/59647862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vext01","id":604955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDk1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/604955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vext01","html_url":"https://github.com/vext01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vext01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vext01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vext01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vext01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vext01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vext01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vext01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vext01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vext01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/59647883","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/878#issuecomment-59647883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/878","id":59647883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjQ3ODgz","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-19T12:10:37Z","updated_at":"2014-10-19T12:10:37Z","body":"It depends on how you build.
