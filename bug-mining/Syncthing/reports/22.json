I have downloaded the binary-file from here.\nThe data i want to sync are encryptet by ecryptfs, because i have a notebook. If i lose it, it's better, that the data encrypted.\n\nNow my problem:\nBefore i used Syncthing for my data, i have tested it with files, who are not encryptet by ecryptfs. It functioned without problems.\nAfter that, i wanted to sync my encrypted files. Syncthing worked for a time, it indexed (or whatever) the files and at one time it aborted. It was not finished.\nWhen i wanted to start it again, Syncthing didn't. It outputted a long error text.\nI tried the whole again, after i deleted the config folder of Syncthing. It worked for a time and aborted again. The same error came, if i started it again.\n\nBefor the error came, it displayed this:\n[WJXHB] 15:39:20 INFO: syncthing v0.9.5 (go1.3.1 linux-amd64 default) jenkins@build 2014-08-16 21:05:57
