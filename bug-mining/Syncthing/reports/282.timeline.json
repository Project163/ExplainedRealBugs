is going to be one of those where it really sucks to be the reviewer, sorry. Everything kind of tied into each other so there's a lot of changes where it doesn't make sense to break them out into separate pull requests... :/ Not done yet, just for visibility. The things happening in this branch so far are:\n- Rewrite the multicast and broadcast beacons to be actual suture.Services with full internal retry forever, and exposing an `Error() error` to the outside to check on their status.\n- Rewrite the local broadcast thing to be separate services for ipv4 broadcast and ipv6 multicasts. It's actually the same code, it just switches out the beacon used based on the format of the address parameter. The discovery service also is a Service supports the same Error() method for inspection from the outside.\n- Lots of code removed from the discovery package as there is no global discovery over udp, so the code sharing and factories depending on the udp4:// etc schema are gone.\n- A new global discovery thing over HTTPS\n- A new caching discovery mux that collects all of these (x \\* global discovery services, ipv4 local, ipv6 local) and presents a single interface to the outside, with Lookup() and child status methods.\n- Some changes in the relay service to easier expose status of the various relays without having to depend on the package for the returned data types and so on.\n\nTo maybe review this somewhat, I'd suggest \n1. starting by looking at the new startup wiring in syncthingMain()\n2.  then looking at the machinery in discovery/discovery.go and the corresponding discovery/{local,global}.go files\n3. then the beacon things.\n4. then the relay things\n\nOr whatever.\n\nThere are some GUI changes to go along with the new error reporting mechanism; both relays and discovery now show as \"3/4\" type indicators (working / total) with the local discovery things just being two of those services and showing their potential errors in the hover...\n\nSome things are unsolved and need fixing:\n- [x] /rest/system/discovery cache contents and \"hint\" posting. Not currently easily accessible. Do we need this functionality at all? Who uses it?\n- [x] stfinddevice needs fixing for the new types\n- [x] the tests should probably pass\n- [x] verify that relaying works and doesn't get stuck in the initial 10 minute delay thing\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2275/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":414244558,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDE0MjQ0NTU4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/414244558","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"b0cd7be39b914a3766a092d1af9d2185a7c59bce","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/b0cd7be39b914a3766a092d1af9d2185a7c59bce","created_at":"2015-09-20T19:16:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1127513954,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExMjc1MTM5NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1127513954","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-16T21:06:52Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"c2e0c6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1127513955,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTEyNzUxMzk1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1127513955","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-16T21:06:52Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
