However I still think any information is better then nothing. To clarify in light of a multi node cluster scenario:\r\n\r\n- The warming should not show if a folder has at least 1 peer that has been online (syncing or not).\r\n- The warning should not appear on a folder if there is a problem with just one of it's peers.\r\n- The warning should only appear on a folder if that folder **on that device** has not synced with any of its peers in weeks (adjustable).\r\n- Maybe we can even extend this and show a stale warning on the peers gui if a peer has not been seen in weeks?\r\n\r\nA real life example from one of my setups. For a folder I had the topology:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6650122/119152293-78b1cb80-ba50-11eb-960d-a85b38807515.png)\r\n\r\nThen my computer had to be replaced and I went about reinstalling everything. Syncthing was not my only priority at the time so I made a mistake and forgot the link to the storage server for this folder:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6650122/119152590-bca4d080-ba50-11eb-9ca5-57be317b4f17.png)\r\n\r\nI do check the health of my storage server by glancing oer the 30+ folders on the syncthing dashboard of my storage server once in a while. However, because I forgot to replace the link the storage server kept showing \"Up to Date\" for this folder even though it had not seen my old PC (and thus any peer) in almost a year. As a consequence I've not enjoyed file versioning for that year.\r\n\r\nNow I do realize that on the storage server I could see my old pc be \"offline\". However, there are many peers (more so than folders) all sometimes online, offline or unused and with different naming schemes making it not really useful to look at and quickly get a feel of the state. And even when I do notice the peer it will just be offline. In practice one looks at the page scanning for warnings (in color) to determine the health of the system. Is there something red or something yellow; then I'll take a look at it. Only this would have draw attention.\r\nThus it would have been really helpful if Syncthing would have notified me with such warning if it hadn't seen any peer for a long time. It has the information readily available already.\r\n\r\nMaybe something like this:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6650122/119155991-0d69f880-ba54-11eb-8e2b-6aeed40a109e.png)\r\n\r\nUpdate: Maybe tombstoned is the wrong wording here.
