\n\nGood question. I'm not really sure on this, but tend to no.\nYes:\n- I've been involved with webdesign for quiet some time and the ways people can misunderstand/misuse user interfaces are absolutely endless. Many people are afraid of clicking things that aren't supposed to be clicked or never get the idea to click anything in the first place.\n- Basically all dropdown fields on websites have either the first element open by default, use those little arrows or both to demonstrate the possibility to open them up.\n\nNo:\n- I'd personally prefer a really clean UI without them.\n- The behaviour and design should be the same between the shared folders and the devices.  Currently no device is opened by default, but one folder is. And having the arrows on both would get old fast.\n- As those dropdowns basically make up the whole UI I'm sure we can experiment a little more than on a usual website. People expect more information than they see -> this should lead to clicking on a few things.\n\nIn the end I'm rather sure we can do without them and simply show something like \"Click for more info\" on mouseover.\n\nEdit: we could also only show the arrows if the cursor hovers over an item.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/64973089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"generalmanager","id":6797943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTc5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6797943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager","html_url":"https://github.com/generalmanager","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/64982591","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1034#issuecomment-64982591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1034","id":64982591,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0OTgyNTkx","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-30T11:32:30Z","updated_at":"2014-11-30T11:32:30Z","body":"> Currently no device is opened by default\n\nThe local device is, at the top.
