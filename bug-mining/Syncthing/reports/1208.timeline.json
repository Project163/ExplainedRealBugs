Examples:\r\n>\r\n> `go run build.go -goos linux -goarch 386 tar`\r\n>    Builds a tar.gz distribution of Syncthing for linux-386.\r\n>\r\n> `go run build.go -goos windows -no-upgrade zip`\r\n>    Builds a zip distribution of Syncthing for Windows (current architecture) with upgrading disabled.\r\n\r\nIf anything I guess the build script could be made to reject the option except for those subcommands. Or the command line parsing changed so that the option only exists for those subcommands. Seems potentially over engineered though. 🤷
