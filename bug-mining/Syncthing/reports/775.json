- Set \"Full Rescan Interval (s)\" to something other than default 3600s (watcher enabled), for example to 9000s (2 h 30 min)\r\n - Save the change and confirm it is written properly in config.xml\r\n - Restart syncthing\r\n - Open UI, review folder info\r\n - Folder info shows rescan at 2h 30min correctly\r\n - Open Edit Folder dialog\r\n - Switch to \"Advanced\" tab\r\n * Actual result: \"Full Rescan Interval (s)\" shows 3600\r\n * Expected result: \"Full Rescan Interval (s)\" shows 9000 as saved in config.xml\r\n\r\nClicking \"Save\" at this point will save 3600 to the config, even though the user has never entered such value.\r\n\r\nReproduction isn't 100%, and my impression is that the more folders devices configured, and the slower everything is, the more likely the issue is to occur.\r\nThe occurrence conditions are somewhat similar to the issue 4915 (stignore is accidentaly overwritten by web UI on slow machines).
