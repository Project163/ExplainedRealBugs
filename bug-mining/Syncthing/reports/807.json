I occasionally see in the logs:\r\n```\r\nstdiscosrv[11974]: Replication read size: read tcp 172.31.3.1:19200->192.168.4.1:50316: i/o timeout\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\nstdiscosrv[12505]: Replication write: write tcp 192.168.4.2:40726->192.168.8.1:19200: write:broken pipe\r\nstdiscosrv[12505]: Supervisor main: main: Failed service 'replicationSender(\"192.168.8.1:19200\")' (1.000000 failures of 5.000000), restarting: true, error: \"{replicationSender(\\\"192.168.8.1:19200\\\") replicationSender(\\\"192.168.8.1:19200\\\")} returned unexpectedly\", stacktrace: [unknown stack trace]\r\n```\r\nAfter closer investigation, it seem that the culprit is this line: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/2c9d96375bb5e3a8dcf7840412462182ce0b9433/cmd/stdiscosrv/replication.go#L248-L252\r\n\r\nNamely, unless there is enough traffic on the wire, the replication connection will be torn down. What is more, the is no reconnect on the other side: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/2c9d96375bb5e3a8dcf7840412462182ce0b9433/cmd/stdiscosrv/replication.go#L105-L110\r\n\r\nSo basically, if there is not enough traffic in the replication servers, the replication will not work.\r\n\r\nI think the solution would be to not to set a read timeout in https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/2c9d96375bb5e3a8dcf7840412462182ce0b9433/cmd/stdiscosrv/replication.go#L245 - i.e. wait indefinitely (preferable), or handle reconnects on the sending side (more work), or implement heartbeats in the replication protocol (quite a bit of work).\r\n\r\nLet me know if this sounds reasonable. I can prepare a patch.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n```\r\nstdiscosrv v0.14.46-ds1 (go1.10rc2 linux-arm)\r\nstdiscosrv v0.14.49 (go1.9.4 linux-amd64)\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5117/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
