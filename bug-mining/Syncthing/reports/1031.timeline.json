changes:\r\n\r\n- A new config option maxConcurrentIncomingRequestKiB has been added to limit the maximum amount of request data being concurrently processed due to incoming requests. This limits Syncthing's peak RAM usage when there are many connected devices all requesting file data. The default is 256 MiB.\r\n\r\n- The config option maxConcurrentScans has been removed and replaced a new config option maxFolderConcurrency. In addition to just limiting concurrent scans it now also limits concurrent sync operations. The default is the number of available CPU threads (\"GOMAXPROCS\").\r\n\r\n- Syncthing now always runs the monitor process, which previously was disabled with -no-restart. This facilitates crash reporting and makes logging behave more consistently. The observed behavior with -no-restart should be the same as before but the internals differ.\r\n\r\n- The database schema has been improved and will result in a migration plus compaction at first startup after the upgrade.\r\n","creator":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":53,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-16T06:48:10Z","updated_at":"2020-03-17T06:20:59Z","due_on":"2020-03-17T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-03-17T06:20:59Z"},"comments":13,"created_at":"2020-02-03T07:03:18Z","updated_at":"2021-05-14T07:02:43Z","closed_at":"2020-02-14T07:30:59Z","author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":14712850,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDcxMjg1MA==","name":"syncthing","full_name":"syncthing/syncthing","private":false,"owner":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing","description":"Open

recently installed and configured Syncthing to sync files across multiple devices. It seemed to work on some folders, but then I ran into an issue or maybe even 2 different issues.\r\n\r\nThere's one folder X shared from device A (Home PC) to device B (Brix).\r\nThe current issue is:\r\n1. Device B shows (in syncthing UI) that it's \"Up to Date\" with device A.\r\n2. Device B shows local state different from global state for the folder X. Both device A and device B show the same global state (which is expected).\r\n3. Device A shows \"syncing\" with device B, but nothing really happens.\r\n4. Device A shows some \"Out of Sync Items\" - I randomly checked 4-5 files on device B - they exist there. But the total folder sizes are different on device A and device B (the latter is smaller).\r\n\r\nDevice A:\r\n![изображение](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6467552/73632212-a4f3de00-468d-11ea-982e-61bc24038bca.png)\r\n![изображение](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6467552/73632244-b4732700-468d-11ea-9423-5d98c01af8a1.png)\r\n\r\nDevice B:\r\n![изображение](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6467552/73632260-c2c14300-468d-11ea-8a61-ae536969d743.png)\r\n![изображение](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6467552/73632275-ce146e80-468d-11ea-9e41-c76a373087d5.png)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThere's another folder Y also shared from device A to device B.\r\nThe problem is:\r\n1. The total size of this folder on the file system is different on A and B. On device B the size is smaller. [UPDATE: this was incorrect - see my comment below]\r\n2. In syncthing UI device A and device B show different number of files for this folder (and different total size) - that's unexpected, and each of them shows that local state is equal to global state. Also, the total size and files count shown on device B are bigger than what device A shows - this is unexpected since all files came to B from A and also wrong (see point 1).\r\n\r\nDevice A:\r\n![изображение](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6467552/73632164-9279a480-468d-11ea-8d84-430b14ed4cdc.png)\r\n\r\nDevice B:\r\n![изображение](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6467552/73632144-85f54c00-468d-11ea-9e84-47f4aa4ddbb8.png)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIn the logs I don't see any issues.
