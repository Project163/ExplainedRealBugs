SyncThing has a ~ in place of the full path the the symlink. If the full path to the symlink in the home directory is provided there is no error. The error only happens on Linux. If I create a new folder in home and specify the path as ~/newFolder to SyncThing it finds the folder without error.\n\nIf I create a folder now, symlink to it from the home directory, and then set it up in syncthing with a ~/symlinkToOtherFolder it works (note I have to edit this after setup in the advanced setting, ~ is automatically converted to /home/user/ in the add folder dialogue). If another computer shares a folder with me, the trying to set it up with the symlink produces the \"not a folder\" error which is only seen in the GUI, the only sign of it in the log is that the log
