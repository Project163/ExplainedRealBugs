So, the nature of logging and the location of log file, if any, depends on the how Syncthing was started. Would it be possible to document simple ways of logging (something similar to http://docs.syncthing.net/users/autostart.html would be great)?\n\nI think on windows logfile is saved in configuration directory. Is it too much work to have an option to have the same behavior on all OS?\n\nBTW, I use following on linux to log to syslog. Works great!\n\n```\n/home/bin/syncthing-linux-amd64/syncthing 2>&1 | logger -t [SYNCTHING]\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2004/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
