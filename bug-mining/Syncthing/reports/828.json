In the Syncthing case, this could take the form of an API method (and menu option in the GUI) that results in a zip file download. In this zip file we would have\r\n\r\n- A text file with basic build info (version / platform)\r\n- The current configuration\r\n- The last few log lines, whatever we have cached in memory\r\n- Any panic files we can find in the config directory\r\n- The contents of the usage reporting data (this would include things like the benchmark and folder sizes which is good to know)\r\n- Maybe, a heap and CPU profile (just a couple of seconds for CPU in that case)\r\n- …?\r\n\r\nMost of this isn't super privacy invasive, possibly excepting folder/device IDs. Potentially we could allow redaction of those in a systematic manner (better we do it than the user, as we then know *how* the config/logs have been mangled). Potentially we could also encrypt the zip file with a random password or similar, so it needs to be explicitly handed over to be understood.\r\n\r\nWe might also want to auto-redact API keys and username / password hashes from the config, as those are never interesting to the recipient. (Whether they are set *at all* or not might be interesting, so we should not just remove them - just set them to `*redacted*` or something if present.)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5142/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5142/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
