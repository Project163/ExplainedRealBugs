But there's an interesting footgun here, because `tcp:/127.0.0.1:22000` gets leniently parsed into a URL with `Host:\"\", Path:\"/127.0.0.1:22000\"`. The lack of host gets fixed by us into the unspecified host and default port, i.e., `0.0.0.0:22000`. That's probably a bit unexpected. So with the naive fix we'll just use this config and silently listen on all interfaces instead of localhost.\r\n\r\nShould it be an error to have a URL in non-canonical form?
