suggested by #1494. @blakev said he wrote a patch to do this, but had trouble building and never submitted a pull request AFAIK. I'm not great with css/boostrap, so feel free to rewrite how the qr button is displayed in the edit device modal. I tested this and it works fine. Closing the device edit modal to open the idqr modal is a little awkward, but I'm not sure how else to do it. I would appreciate feedback, this is my first time contributing to syncthing!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2625/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":503761125,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTAzNzYxMTI1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/503761125","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"ffc4a60bc69ae63b4ab8b3a9cf6ad825caf00d4a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/ffc4a60bc69ae63b4ab8b3a9cf6ad825caf00d4a","created_at":"2016-01-01T10:25:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1127516983,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExMjc1MTY5ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1127516983","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-16T21:08:46Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"c2e0c6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1127516988,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTEyNzUxNjk4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1127516988","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-16T21:08:46Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
