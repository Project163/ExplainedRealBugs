I couldn't capture it because it disappears when a key is pressed (e.g. printscreen)\r\n- The \"folders\" section in the \"device list\" also uses the same html tooltip instead of the webui black one.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16083086/116078694-82eadf00-a6c9-11eb-8370-a4ec12790526.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nas a sidenote, I've noticed that on touchscreen devices (Android), the hover-to-show tooltip becomes tap-to-show/tap-to-hide. Therefore because one cannot hover with a touchscreen, the \"Shared With\"/\"Folders\" html tooltip simply does not show up at all.","closed_by":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
