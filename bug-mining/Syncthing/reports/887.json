issue is in reaction to https://forum.syncthing.net/t/pretty-drastic-amount-of-writes-when-doing-initial-scan/12850 and a regression in #5441. Already since before that regression batch writes are flushed to db based on number of entries in the batch. That's okish, if entries are of the same size. However since #5441 that's no longer true, as full file infos are written in the same batch as e.g. blockmap entries. Before file infos were flushed after 64 batched items, blockmap entries after 1000, now it's 64 for both together.\r\n\r\nI propose to use `func (b *Batch) Dump() []byte` to check the byte length of the batch and decide whether to flush based on that. Dump does not copy the data, so it should be efficient. Handwaving conversion of previous limits (64*fileinfo = 64 * (2000 blocks + more) = 64 * (8kB + 8kB) = 1MB) increasing a bit due to Moore gets me to 8MB limit. Any other (potentially more informed) propositions?","closed_by":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5531/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
