the title says, Syncthing recreates or tries to recreate the directories for deleted or missing Folders. I have two examples below. They are similar in the sense that the Folder path and folder marker are gone when the issue happens.\r\n\r\n## Example 1\r\n### What happened\r\n- I had a Folder added to Syncthing residing at path `/Volumes/foo/bar/baz` which is on an external hard drive. Just to clarify, the folder marker is `/Volumes/foo/bar/baz/.stfolder`.\r\n- I decided to move it to somewhere else but also decided to deal with updating the path of the Folder later.\r\n- I paused the Folder in Syncthing UI.\r\n- I moved the folder to its new location. `foo` directory doesn't exist in `/Volumes` anymore.\r\n- [issue] When I restart Syncthing it creates the `/Volumes/foo/bar/baz` directory structure while the Folder is still paused.\r\n- [expected] If I resume the Folder I get `folder marker missing` error\r\n\r\n### What I expected to happen\r\n- Syncthing should not create `foo/bar/baz` directories in `/Volumes`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n- Create a few directories inside each other on an external drive (I am not sure if the drive being external is necessary, that is just how my setup is)\r\n- Add the deepest directory to Syncthing as a Folder\r\n- Pause the Folder\r\n- Delete the whole directory structure up to the root of the external drive\r\n- Restart Syncthing\r\n- Observe. Sometimes Finder doesn't update itself so closing/reopening the Finder window might be necessary.\r\n\r\n### Screen recording (8.1 MB)\r\n![folder recreation bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/732128/39232569-9305e974-4822-11e8-8f28-825bae7b7874.gif)\r\n\r\n## Example 2\r\n### What happened\r\n- I have an encrypted directory that I mount to /Volumes/EncFS, which is also added to Syncthing. Just to clarify, the folder marker is `/Volumes/EncFS/.stfolder`.\r\n- When I restart my computer, that encrypted directory is not mounted automatically.\r\n- [issue] Syncthing start automatically and gives me `Creating directory for foobar: mkdir /Volumes/EncFS: permission denied ` error. (`foobar` is a directory that is in `/Volumes/EncFS` when the encrypted directory is mounted.)\r\n- [expected] I also get `folder marker missing` error\r\n\r\n### What I expected to happen\r\n- Syncthing should not try to create `EncFS` or `EncFS/foobar` directories in `/Volumes`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n- Create an encrypted directory\r\n- Mount the encrypted directory\r\n- Add some files/directories in the mount point\r\n- Add the mount point to Syncthing as a Folder\r\n- Share that Folder with other Syncthing instances and make sure they are synched\r\n- Restart computer.\r\n- Open Syncthing UI and observe the errors.\r\n\r\n#### Version Information\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.46, macOS (64 bit)\r\nOS Version: macOS High Sierra 10.13.4 (17E202)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4903/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/426742000","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5077#issuecomment-426742000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5077","id":426742000,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjc0MjAwMA==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-03T18:17:21Z","updated_at":"2018-10-03T18:17:21Z","body":"@imsodin how would one debug this?
