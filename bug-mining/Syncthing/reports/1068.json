In the meantime, if the other side tries to connect it is refused as a duplicate connection. The relevant code has this comment:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// We should not already be connected to the other party. TODO: This\r\n// could use some better handling. If the old connection is dead but\r\n// hasn't timed out yet we may want to drop *that* connection and keep\r\n// this one. But in case we are two devices connecting to each other\r\n// in parallel we don't want to do that or we end up with no\r\n// connections still established...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should implement the mentioned \"better handling\".\r\n\r\nIt's probably as easy as just dropping the existing connection if it's older than some threshold, otherwise dropping the new one.\r\n\r\n(I'm sure there are still implementation complexities as we need to disconnect and wait for that to percolate everywhere before we can add the new connection etc.)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5224/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5224/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
