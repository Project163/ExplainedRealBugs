running a model test with `-count 1000` I ran into OOM. Looking at a stacktrace I found these culprits:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    340 github.com/syncthing/syncthing/lib/model.(*ProgressEmitter).Serve\r\n    340 github.com/syndtr/goleveldb/leveldb.(*DB).compactionError\r\n    340 github.com/syndtr/goleveldb/leveldb.(*DB).mCompaction\r\n    340 github.com/syndtr/goleveldb/leveldb.(*DB).mpoolDrain\r\n    340 github.com/syndtr/goleveldb/leveldb.(*DB).tCompaction\r\n    340 github.com/syndtr/goleveldb/leveldb/util.(*BufferPool).drain\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe progress emitter is straight forward: It should be added to the supervisor not manually run in a goroutine. The leveldb stuff is because we do not close the the database, both in tests and in cmd/syncthing's `main`. In `main` the database is manipulated before passing it to the model, but not concurrently with the model. So there's two options\r\n\r\n1. Close the db on `model.Close`: Nice because we don't need to think about it in all the tests.\r\n2. Close the db where it is created, meaning in cmd/syncthing's `main` and every single test that uses a db. The \"cleaner\" approach because the same function that opens it also closes it but it's tedious.\r\n\r\nOpinions? @AudriusButkevicius @calmh ","closed_by":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
