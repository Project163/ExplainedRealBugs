suspect there are a number of places exporting things by ID where the name is not readily available. An other option could be to expose an info metric, like a gauge with ID, name, type labels and just the value 1 for each folder & device. You can then join with that in the promql query.

Purpose\r\n\r\nThis is intended to address concerns raised in #9519.  The intent is to add an info gauge (as suggested by @calmh) to ease human cross-referencing of stats as stored by IDs and meaningful strings. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI have run the automated tests.  I did not see where these tests exercise the metrics reporting in particular.\r\nAs such, I have not added any new tests.  An interested party could use their favorite metrics explorer to find the new gauges and correlate them with other labeled metrics.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThis change will be visible to users in their metrics databases, but not within any interface of syncthing to my knowledge. I am happy to document the new metric gauges if there is a reasonable place to do so.\r\n\r\n### Additional Info\r\n\r\nThis is my first attempt to contribute to `syncthing`.  Process errors or omissions are somewhat expected.  I am happy to iterate on this work and make such adjustments as help the
