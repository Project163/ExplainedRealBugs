on a remote node is absolutely bogus by any measure I can think of more often than not.\n\nIn this most recent case, I'm syncing approximately 15.1 GB of data between two systems.  On the system the data is coming from, the system it's syncing to shows as 93% in sync, while on the remote system, the folder in question is 20% in sync. Based on the comparison of local state totals on both systems, the recieving system is roughly 50% in sync overall.  Further calculation based on just that folder in question indicates that the 20% in sync estimate is accurate for that folder.\n\nAssuming no background  whatsoever, I'd expect the 'Syncing' percentage for a device to reflect how far the remote device is from the global state directly, and it's pretty obviously not doing so.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/244536398","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/623#issuecomment-244536398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/623","id":244536398,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NDUzNjM5OA==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-03T09:19:46Z","updated_at":"2016-09-03T09:19:46Z","body":"Given that we don't keep track of other devices' activity, and can't do so in the general case, would it be a valid bandaid over this to simply rename the state?

They would evaluate a combined ignore list from the union of Alice's ignore list and theirs; from this the shared file list would be the full set of files minus any that are in the combined ignore list.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is that right now, a node only has to maintain one ignore list per shared folder.  If this were implemented, it would have to maintain one ignore list for each (shared folder, machine) pair; this could mean a lot more data stored, especially if the number of machines in the cluster is large, and depending on the data requirements of an ignore list.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/288509278/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dgnuff","id":26607068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjA3MDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26607068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgnuff","html_url":"https://github.com/dgnuff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgnuff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgnuff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgnuff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgnuff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgnuff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgnuff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgnuff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgnuff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgnuff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/288592294","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/623#issuecomment-288592294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/623","id":288592294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODU5MjI5NA==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-23T01:42:05Z","updated_at":"2017-03-23T01:42:05Z","body":"I actually have this implemented in a branch, there was just some tweaking to do with the events generated.
