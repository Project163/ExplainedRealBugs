I don't think there is...) However, most if not all cases where deletion doesn't free any additional space _at the time of deletion_ the files are nonetheless deleted, and thus treated as deleted files, which typically means they will age off _eventually_, and when eventually happens, more syncing can proceed.\r\n\r\nAnd besides when a node is doing snapshots/archives/file versioning it really should have enough space to do so, and failing that it will remain stuck even after deletions are \"applied\". In this scenarrio the right thing is to get more storage space on that node.\r\n\r\nIn scenarios where the node space is rather limited and things can \"accidentally\" get too full, the right thing is to undo the accident (delete the file).

Examples are:\r\n\"file went away on remote server while syncing\"\r\n\"remote server that has file went away\"\r\n\"symlinks not supported\"\r\n\r\nErrors like these show up under an error count link under the folder. Expanding the link lists each file in error state and an explanation of the error (with strings like the above)\r\n\r\nFolder state is to be stuck at a certain percentage of sync and not progressing, along with this file error count.\r\n\r\nIs this the direction we want to go with free space errors? That is the file puller generates an error for that file that says it can't (or refuses to) pull the file for lack of space. And the folder remains out of sync, with explanations, but doesn't have a folder health level error?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/340531576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vontrapp","id":919013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxOTAxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/919013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vontrapp","html_url":"https://github.com/vontrapp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vontrapp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vontrapp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vontrapp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vontrapp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vontrapp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vontrapp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vontrapp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vontrapp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vontrapp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
