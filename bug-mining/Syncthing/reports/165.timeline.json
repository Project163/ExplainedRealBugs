a quick thought:\nI just created a new repo with some video files in it. Just after Syncthing's restart, my HDD broke out in a terrible activtiy. I think it's because multiple scanner-threads that are indexing my video files, which needs some time due to the filesize. The problem is, that the scanning speed is greatly reduced because of the high seek activity of the hdd.\nIs there a possibilty to reduce the amount of scanner-threads? Looking at the handles, currently there might be four scanning-threads accessing the same hdd.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1127519486,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExMjc1MTk0ODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1127519486","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-16T21:10:23Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"c2e0c6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1127519490,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTEyNzUxOTQ5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1127519490","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-16T21:10:23Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
