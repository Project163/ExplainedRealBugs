In the verbose log there are these messages:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[VK627] 15:17:59 VERBOSE: FolderWatchStateChanged events.Event{SubscriptionID:26, GlobalID:26, Time:time.Time{wall:0xbf1ce1fdcebe16cc, ext:1632000601, loc:(*time.Location)(0x1463440)}, Type:33554432, Data:map[string]interface {}{\"folder\":\"maa2q-yxpwp\", \"to\":\"Access is denied.\"}}\r\n[VK627] 15:18:05 VERBOSE: Summary for folder \"maa2q-yxpwp\" is map[errors:0 globalBytes:0 globalDeleted:0 globalDirectories:0 globalFiles:0 globalSymlinks:0 globalTotalItems:0 inSyncBytes:0 inSyncFiles:0 localBytes:0 localDeleted:0 localDirectories:0 localFiles:0 localSymlinks:0 localTotalItems:0 needBytes:0 needDeletes:0 needDirectories:0 needFiles:0 needSymlinks:0 needTotalItems:0 pullErrors:0 sequence:0 state:idle version:0 watchError:Access is denied.]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe \"Watch Error: Access is denied\" message will finally appear on the GUI webpage.\r\n\r\nI am working in a multi-user workstation where fine-grained ACLs are configured by the administrator. It's common to have a folder structure like \"C:\\secret_agents\\007\" where I own the \"007\" folder but cannot list the parent folder, \"secret_agent\". \r\nOlder versions of Syncthing (<= 0.14.49) worked fine with such ACL settings but the above error starts to appear when I update syncthing to newer versions (>= 1.0).\r\n\r\n### Environments\r\n\r\n- Syncthing Version: v1.1.0\r\n- OS Version: Windows 10 and 7\r\n- File system: NTFS\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a folder `C:\\parent\\child` and configure Syncthing to monitor it.\r\n2. In the access control list (ACL) of folder `C:\\parent` , unset the \"List Folder\" permission and keep the \"Traverse Folder\" permission allowed.\r\n3. Enable all permissions for folder `C:\\parent\\child`.\r\n4. Restart Syncthing.","closed_by":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5609/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
