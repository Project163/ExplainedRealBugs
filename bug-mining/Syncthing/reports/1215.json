So far so good. However, I've created an issue on the cryptomator side (see https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/1540), but as I understood having a unique file id (provided by the file systems) is nothing you can rely on, according to the cryptomator developers. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is true or not, but it seems to be true, as e.g. almost all tools can work with a cryptomator drive without issues - but syncthing. \r\n\r\nAs syncthing is a greate / cool tool, I'd like to bring this to your attention.\r\n\r\nSyncthing in use: V1.13.1, Windows 10 20H2.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7385/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
