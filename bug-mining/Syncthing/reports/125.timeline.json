who want to get at those datasets. A short compromise wouldn't suffice, instead they'd at least have to log and temporarily save the ip addresses of all devices connecting to both services over a <=24h period to map them.\n\nOn a side note: the clients are supposed to connect once every 24 hours. Do they all connect at a certain time, differenciable only by clock drift? Or does every device randomize the connection time within each 24h period? Or is it randomized once on installation?

If the web server of the discovery server logs IPs longer than they are kept for discovery purposes (60m IIRC), this should be turned off asap.\nIf not otherwise specified, I presume the attacker wants to avoid long-term infection, where she loggs all IPs herself, to minimize the risk of detection. This leaves attacks on the stored data.\n\nThere are several possible stages of IP logging on the data usage data server if we use different IDs:\n1. **Neither the collection service nor the web server save IPs during usual operation.** The web server might save IPs in case of errors.\n   That would be ideal privacy wise. No ip-based mapping possible, but we should still randomize the reporting time on the client.\n2. **The collection service doesn't log IPs, the web server does.**\n   If I see this correctly (just skipped over the code) the collection service currently doesn't save the IP which delivered the data for e.g. country coding. If it did, the country coding should happen at time of delivery and only save the results, not the IPs. \n   If the web server does indeed log IPs, something like tripwire at least has a chance to detect unusual access patterns for the logs. And the timeframe before logged IPs are deleted should be as short as possible.\n3. **The collection service logs IPs, the web server may or may not.**\n   Intrusion detection would be much more difficult if the collection service saved the IPs separately.\n   In this case only uncertainties about IP-ID mapping in case of multiple syncthing users with the same IP but no/weak real life relationship provide a privacy benefit over direct ID mapping. This may sound obscure but if syncthing popularity rises, at least users of city-wide public wifi or students in dorms with shared IPs have a real advantage. Wide deployment of IPv6 might kill this tough. In case of shared households with multiple syncthing users it's at least not 100% clear which data set belongs to whom.\n\n**In all of the above cases the IP-based correllation is weaker than the ID-based one, providing more privacy to the user.**\n\n**Randomized client access times as a countermeasure to mapping of usage reports to logged IPs should also be implemented**.\n\nIf a syncthing user starts to connect via TOR, the old IP is still saved for at least 60 minutes on the discovery server and possibly forever on the usage reporting server.\n**Contrary to popular believ IPV4 addresses are often not very ephemeral. Several big european cable providers hand out the same IPs for months until the cable modem reboots for whatever reason**.  If you safe the same addresses on any of the servers long term, even the data of TOR-users who haven't directly connected can be mapped to their current IP address in this case.\n\n**In addition there are several very real problems with the SSL implementation of data.syncthing.net (see https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=data.syncthing.net):**\n- **You don't seem to do certificate pinning for the web server**, which would certainly be a good idea. There is a nice post from the creator of ssl-strip and TextSecure about this:\n  http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/authenticity-is-broken-in-ssl-but-your-app-ha/\n  The reference implementation he talks about from Adam Langley (one of Googles top security folks) is written in Go. Adam Langley also wrote Pond, which is widely considered to be the state of the art in anonymous & secure text-based communication.\n- **Your server is currently still vulnerable to the POODLE attack**\n  POODLE shouldn't have a _direct_ impact in the case of usage reporting, because it needs client side scripting to work, but still.\n- It supports RC4-based cipher suites. Those are widely believed to be breakable live by at least the NSA and maybe other nation-state adversaries right now.\n- SHA1 is used for certificate signing and should really not be used any more, similar to RC4. \n- Downgrade attacks are not prevented.\n- Only partial forward secrecy. This can be used by a MITM to downgrade to non-forward secret ciphers. Please only use forward secret ciphers in the first place.\n\nAnd then there is the case of something like Heartbleed 2.0, where an attacker with passive collection capabilities can decrypt previously recorded sessions with little to no risk of detection. \nThis is comparable to case 3, where only IP-addresses shared between multiple users provide improved privacy over direct ID mapping.\n\nIf an entity is able to break open single SSL connections (as it is currently possible with the RC4-based ciphers, or a possible future vulnerability), the threat is similar, but if MITM is needed, it may be prohibitive to do attacks on all clients in a 24h period for reasons of detectability.\n\n**TL;DR**: Please don't save IPs on the usage reporting server at all and no longer than the specified 60m on the discovery server (discovery DB and the webserver log). Long term compromise of both servers or all SSL connections at least leaves users with shared IP addresses a sliver of anonymity.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/64196156/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"generalmanager","id":6797943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTc5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6797943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager","html_url":"https://github.com/generalmanager","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/64269957","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1000#issuecomment-64269957","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1000","id":64269957,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MjY5OTU3","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-24T21:42:32Z","updated_at":"2014-11-24T21:46:02Z","body":"> TL;DR: Please don't save IPs on the usage reporting server at all and no longer than the specified 60m on the discovery server (discovery DB and the webserver log).\n\nThis is exactly how it is currently.\n\nTo be honest, this feels a bit like a moot point.

If ultimate privacy and security is your goal, turning on any kind of usage reporting–\"anonymous\" or not–seems like a bad idea.\n\nI agree from a technical perspective. But this isn't about myself or somebody with a similar level of understanding of these issues not turning on the usage reporting, because those people are making an informed decision. The problem I see is that we are calling it anonymous while most users will have rather serious misconceptions of what level of anonymity can be expected. This is not the same quality of anonymity which the Tor project or certain darknets provide. Which is absolutely okay for a general purpose sync tool with focus on openness and privacy. But if Syncthing gets adopted more widely, the average user can't possibly know how big the gap actually is. \nThey will probably use this tool because their nerdy friends said that it's a privacy friendly alternative to Dropbox, BTsync and the like. They put a lot of trust in you and the community in general.\n\nI would just like to see this trust beeing honored by beeing honest about the true quality of anonymity provided. IMHO we should either not use the word anonymous or not save the same identifier all my friends know me by, which is also linkable to my actual identity by the owner of the discovery server.\n\n> The information sent to the usage reporting server is essentially public (you're already sharing it with a third party), hence I'm not super worried about downgrade attacks and certificate forgeries here.\n> The discovery is likewise public. That's the whole point, to provide mapping between device ID and IP.\n\nI feel that there is a similar misunderstanding of technically public vs. what most people believe to be public. Of course everything one submits/uploads anywhere has to be considered public from an OPSEC point of view.\nBut this is not how most people think about public vs private, otherwise Faceboogle wouldn't have a working business model.\n\nThe main assumptions regarding usage reporting usually seem to be:\n- Whoever I am sharing this information with is responsible enough to only publish information anonymized by averaging the reported data over the whole user base.\n- The recipient is technically adept enough to protect this information from malicious third parties.\n\nAnd I think the second point makes it a reasonable move to prevent trivial mapping of the information from usage reports to IPs, which is currently not the case.\n\nRegarding the discovery server: maybe the majority of the current user base understands how this works, but I am rather shure this will change once the usage stats stop showing the majority of clients to be on linux.\nAnd I also wouldn't want to consider this information public, because the protocol clearly states that you only receive a response if you already know a clients unique ID, which is generally protected by TLS and the information beeing stored on a well-configured server in contrast to a Kademlia-style DHT.\n\nThe strong protection of those IDs between clients (via cert pinning and removing weak ciphers for p2p) is however undermined by the weak implementations on the discovery and statistics server.\n\nI am not asking you to make Syncthing only usable within I2P or Gnunet, because this would be completeley overblown even for a privacy-friendly sync tool. What I am asking for is that we either fulfill the expectations of security _users with little technical background_ have, or change those expectations by not advertising a function with very little technical anonymity as anonymous.\n\nWe know what to expect, because we understand how it works on a technical level. Most people don't and have to trust us to get the terminology _and_ technology right.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/64389494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"generalmanager","id":6797943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTc5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6797943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager","html_url":"https://github.com/generalmanager","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/64433704","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1000#issuecomment-64433704","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1000","id":64433704,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NDMzNzA0","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-25T17:02:49Z","updated_at":"2014-11-25T17:02:49Z","body":"So, I'm not at all opposed to using a different ID for the reports.

Some writers have argued that namelessness, though technically correct, does not capture what is more centrally at stake in contexts of anonymity. The important idea here is that a person be non-identifiable, unreachable, or untrackable.[1] Anonymity is seen as a technique, or a way of realizing, certain other values, such as privacy, or liberty.\n\nIn this context I interpret it so that (as long as no deeply invasive actions like forensical analysis or attacks are involved) nobody can link the submitted data to you or any identifying information.
