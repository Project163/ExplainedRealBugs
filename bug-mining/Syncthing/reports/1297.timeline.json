As you noted via the above forum post link, this issue bit me hard this week, so I would have benefited from some kind of mitigation.\r\n\r\nChanging the defaults when the host is BSD would have been helpful, but honestly would not have helped me **that** much, because I probably would have simply turned it on when I set everything up.\r\n\r\nHonestly, as a sysadmin, I would cast my vote for a UI warning along with some clear documentation around the risks and tradeoffs of enabling the feature. I think that would have saved me a couple days of hair-pulling.\r\n\r\nTo further clarify, I don't think the biggest issue is the performance impact itself. I think the biggest issue was the mystery of trying to figure out **what was causing** the performance impact. So a clear UI warning would have been incredibly helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks again for working on Syncthing.
