feel free to make a pull request.\nGiven it's implemented sensibly, I am pretty sure @calmh will consider merging it.\n\nSaying Windows and Android is not a good reason not to support is not true (at least what I believe in).\nTurning the code into an unmanageable mess just for the sake of it working on Unix, is a good enough reason for me. I just sadly cannot comprehend a sensible solution which works across the board.\n\nBy the end of the day, we (or perhaps that is just my personal view) are trying to make a tool which works on multiple platforms, and we try to make sure that all features work on all platforms (more or less).\n\nI guess you could do uid:gid mapping based on the user account names across Unix and Windows, but then perhaps Unix people would expect it to work based on integers...
