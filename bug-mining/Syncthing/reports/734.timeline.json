Purpose\r\n\r\nThe scenario is well described in #2571, in short: If a dir is replaced by a symlink, the files within the dir aren't marked as deleted in the database if they exist at the location the new symlink points to. The other device will therefore fail to remove the directory because it isn't empty.  \r\nThe issue further describes that when you manually delete the directory, contents from the symlink target gets deleted: This isn't the case even previous to this PR, as we check that we don't descend into symlinks.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nNew unit test for this

Purpose\r\n\r\nFixes #2571 and #4573 by extending the file info returned from a scan by a \"ReplacedDir\" parameter, which signifies that the old file info in the db was a directory (and now is a file/symlink). This information is used to detect deleted children, for which \"IsNotExist\" returns false.  \r\nIn addition this makes sure that these deleted children are updated in the db before their parent is replaced, thus preventing intermediate pull (dir not empty) failures when the entire update exceeds the batch size.  \r\nCompared to #4568 (which is obsolete if going forward with the approach of this PR) this uses information from scanning instead of doing more lstat calls.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTwo unit tests specific to the fixed issues and `TestInternalScan`. The last one is there because all tests passed with an earlier version of this PR, while it was severely broken - this test would have failed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4584/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1451655990,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MTQ1MTY1NTk5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1451655990","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-31T20:54:32Z","milestone":{"title":"Planned"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1451655991,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDE0NTE2NTU5OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1451655991","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-31T20:54:32Z","milestone":{"title":"Unplanned
