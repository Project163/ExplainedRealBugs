have read in other issues that the data corruption problem has been solved in v0.10.7+, but it seems to still exist. I already had it a couple of times now. It started 2 months ago or so. Until now it always helped to just remove the index-folder and restart syncthing. This time, this does not seem to work. I've done that a few times now, but I always get the corruption error at some point.\n\nI'm currently using v0.10.21. There are multiple devices in my \"syncthing network\", but only 2 of them were connected while the problem occurred and I have removed the index on both. I've uploaded a few of the panic-logs I received. Please tell me if you need more:\n- http://pastebin.com/ELq60ZaA\n- http://pastebin.com/jJE805qS\n- http://pastebin.com/jz3j7e4B\n\nNote also that one of my syncthing instances runs on ARM, the other on x86. The problem only occurred on ARM so far.\n\nI hope you can fix this bug very soon, because this is of course a showstopper since I can't use syncthing at the moment. And I really want to stick to it, because it's the best sync-solution for me, apart from these problems :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/77704317","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/987#issuecomment-77704317","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/987","id":77704317,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NzA0MzE3","user":{"login":"mskenderian","id":3152700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTI3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3152700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian","html_url":"https://github.com/mskenderian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-07T19:04:19Z","updated_at":"2015-03-07T19:04:19Z","body":"I have the same issue, i deleted the whole db (index) it worked for sometime, then same things again after some time.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/77704317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mskenderian","id":3152700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTI3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3152700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian","html_url":"https://github.com/mskenderian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mskenderian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/77799883","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/987#issuecomment-77799883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/987","id":77799883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3Nzk5ODgz","user":{"login":"Otto23","id":10795151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzk1MTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10795151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Otto23","html_url":"https://github.com/Otto23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Otto23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Otto23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Otto23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Otto23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Otto23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Otto23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Otto23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Otto23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Otto23/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-09T04:48:12Z","updated_at":"2015-03-09T04:48:12Z","body":"What is your OS ?
