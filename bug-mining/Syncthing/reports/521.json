With a warning, but that warning goes away and then the device looks happy in the GUI. Instead, we should accept the invalid files into the index, display a non-100% sync status, and warn repeatedly (every pull iteration, unless we do something else?).\n\n---\n\nHello,\n\nI have a Linux (Mint 17.3) machine synching a backup folder to a Windows 7 computer. I thought the backup was running correctly for a couple of months, but when I had to format I found out many files never arrived at the Windows machine.\n\nObviously the problem was Windows stupid filepath limitation, but I was a bit scared that Syncthing didn't warn me in any way that some files were never synched. The fact that it told me all that time that the folder was _up to date_ is very unnerving.\n\nI would like to request some sort of warning when this happens. The folder on the Linux machine was set as a master folder, and no file was ever added to the Windows machine's folder manually, so it should tell me that there were files missing on the other end, not that the folder was up to date.\n\nI can't specify the version because I went through several Syncthing updates in that time.\n\nThank you.\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3012/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
