The current presence of `CamelCase` is just laziness in not specifying a JSON encoding on the structs.\n\nI don't really care too much whether we always use `/` as path separator or the local OS convention, as long as we always do the same thing. :) (We should probably always accept either in input, unless there's some specific reason we want to be more picky somewhere.)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/77768872/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"pascalj","id":330168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDE2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/330168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalj","html_url":"https://github.com/pascalj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pascalj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-15T11:57:28Z","updated_at":"2015-03-15T11:57:28Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1465","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1465/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1465/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1465/events","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/pull/1465","id":61801424,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzExOTkyMzY=","number":1465,"title":"Use

the current mix of UpperCamelCase und lowerCamelCase with consistent lowerCamelCase keys for the JSON API. Also adapt the frontend so it works with the changed API. Abbreviations are now lowercase, so `UseTLS` becomes `useTls` and so on.\n\nAs for the separator issue mentioned in #1338: the `/rest/system` endpoint already sends the `pathSeparator` that is used. That way, no Information is lost and consumers can still replace the separator if needed. I didn't make any changes regarding the separator.\n\n**Attention**: this will break existing consumers of the API.\n\n~~This PR depends on
