Purpose\r\n\r\nCurrently the folder root is evaluated (to resolve symlinks) at fs creation. At that point the directory may not exist or `EvalSymlinks` may fail for other reasons. The current implementation just ignores that case by assuming there are no symlinks. That's dangerous because if there are, it will lead to panics on watching. Also the only place where this evaluated root is needed is for watching. Therefore the evaluation of the root path now happens when `fs.Watch` is called.
