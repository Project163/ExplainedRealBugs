This (`sendFullIndexOnUpgrade=true`) used to be the behavior in previous versions, but is mainly useful as a troubleshooting step and causes high database churn. The new default is `false`.","creator":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":36,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-09-15T17:43:50Z","updated_at":"2020-11-03T10:11:12Z","due_on":"2020-11-03T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-11-03T10:11:12Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-10-03T15:28:23Z","updated_at":"2021-10-04T07:02:39Z","closed_at":"2020-10-03T18:46:20Z","author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"I'm trying to add the aarch64 pkg on Alpine repositories but we're still stuck on tests that fail with this architecture.\r\n\r\nHere the full log:\r\nhttps://paste.sr.ht/~reedwade/18d36d4ed6dcb6c6d4696b3e0d6b28c880c2af89\r\n\r\nHere the full recipe:\r\nhttps://git.alpinelinux.org/aports/tree/community/syncthing/APKBUILD?id=5899f8a6a1300ca6814737ffce364eb81a766719\r\n\r\nit seems I still can build with a second try : https://paste.sr.ht/~reedwade/6f26c06d1fd51bc9fd5685cfdb97edbff002b4ef\r\n\r\nIs it a known issue ?
