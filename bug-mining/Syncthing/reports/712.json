I use it to sync the files to a backup storage.\nHowever restoration form the .stversion folder is a mess. You have to rename all the files to remove the timestamp in the name. It would be great to have a GUI for this function.\n## USECASE:\n\nI had the problem, when i was working with my colleague on a school project.\nI accidentally deleted a folder inclusive its subfolders. Through inotify, they were also immediately deleted on his side too. Luckily he had the \"Simple Versioning\" enabled. So we could copy all the files back from the .stversion folder. But it was HARD work to manually rename all the files back to their original name and to sort the multiple versions out.\n\nIt would have been only four or five clicks with a GUI. Just give the order to revert the files (copy the files back to the Sync folder and rename them), which have a timestamp between 13:10 and 13:20.\n\nAnd at least, I had to ask my Colleague to copy the files back, because they were in his .stversion folder. I couldn't have done anything from my side.\n\nI just thought it would be a nice feature in usability, to have such a GUI revert function.\n## IMPLEMENTATION:\n\nIt would just require a list of all the files in .stversion folder to be transfered.\nAfter that the list only has to be filtered for the files, the user wants to restore,\nbased on the timestamp and send back.\nAt least a single command could be emited to fullfill the copy and rename process of the selected files.\n## GUI:\n\nI propose to insert a \"Revert\" Button next to the \"Rescan\" and \"Edit\" buttons of the folders.\nOf course only if versioning is enabled in any of the synced devices.\n\nThis opens a Window like following Picture:\n![gui_proposal](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13203829/11912872/8712a924-a651-11e5-8573-1492b3396c53.png)\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2599/reactions","total_count":28,"+1":25,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2599/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
