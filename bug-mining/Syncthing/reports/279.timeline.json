However, I use quite a complicated setup involving network namespaces to run some programs around the VPN so they're not using it (mostly Steam). The issue was that I haven't set up the broadcast address for the veth0 interface inside the namespace. Before:\n\n```\n9: veth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000\n    link/ether 7a:xx:xx:xx:xx:de brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 172.25.10.50/24 scope global veth0\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```\n9: veth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000\n    link/ether 7a:xx:xx:xx:xx:de brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff\n    inet 172.25.10.50/24 brd 172.25.10.255 scope global veth0\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\n```\n\nThe command I'm using now is `ip net exec steam ip a a 172.25.10.50/24 b 172.25.10.255 dev veth0`, before the `b 172.25.10.255` part was omitted. Now the message is gone and the local discovery works instantly. What confuses me is that after I've added the IPv4 broadcast address both of my devices (Nexus 4 and Nexus 10) connected via local IPv6, before they always connected to the router WAN address. It's like this lack of IPv4 broadcast prevents any broadcasts, even when the local IPv6 is available (and most often it is by default). So there may be a bug buried somewhere.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/100869864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rkfg","id":184066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg","html_url":"https://github.com/rkfg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/101999291","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1388#issuecomment-101999291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1388","id":101999291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMTk5OTI5MQ==","user":{"login":"rkfg","id":184066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg","html_url":"https://github.com/rkfg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-14T10:38:59Z","updated_at":"2015-05-14T10:38:59Z","body":"Hmm, I should be wrong.
