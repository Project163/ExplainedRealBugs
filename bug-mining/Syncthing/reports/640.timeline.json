work with a team of animators, and our Syncthing share has a huge, nested share structure that currently has about 80GB in it, and it's growing a little bit every day. \nI don't know how difficult this would be to make happen (I imagine very), but there have been a couple times in working with Syncthing with a team that I have had to deal with infinite directory loops. Oftentimes they are a result from erring on some Syncthing share algebra, but the fact that it's happened twice in the past couple months could be cause for concern. In those instances, a popup warning that lets us know something along the lines of \"Continuing with what you are doing could result in an infinite directory loop!\" would have been really nice to keep us from making a that terrible mistake.\n\nIf you can't pull the directory structure at share creation, then maybe while it's starting its initial sync, run some pattern recognition that kills the sync process for the affected shares? This might help a lot since not all of my people are very technically inclined. Just a thought.

you're right as long as the user Saves the currently selected path, whether it is a parent or subdir, as it will end in (a) nested share(s), and for this **red** is **the** color and there is nothing to argue.\r\nBut : **as there is no popup** for validation in the end and 2 different dynamic messages may appear* in the step-by-step process of selecting a path, displaying easily eyes-catching distinguished message may be of some help. Whatever, for the translation I work on, I used this way : for subdir case I use uppercase \"WARNING, blah blah...del or dups\"(because there is more chances this is yet a **wrong** idea from the newb), and for the parent case I used the simple \"Warning, bloh bloh,...del or dups, so you should create a new dir.\" because this message appears as soon as we are in the path field and hit a nux \"/\" or win \"\\\\\" in selection process and ST can't know if we are going to a more precise independent path or if we will Save at this very step showing the \"...is a parent...\" message, in which case we'd rather know what we are doing (and again red would be the color too, whatever I said previously).\r\nTrying to be more precise on what may puzzle people, I'll describe what happens to me when selecting a path : First of all click \"Add folder\" : the \"Add popup\"...pops-up...with either one or the other warning displayed as per this very #3433 (because puzzled by the warning I canceled to retry ;-) which leaves as is the previous warning, Okay, let's admit and go on, there also may be no weird message at all): ~, hit \"/\" or ArrowDown, the \"...parent...\" warn message appears under the droplist full of my hidden .dirs in ~, then hit S (as I know my main dir is Sync), the drop-list with same 4 lines length gets nearly empty (single line for me as I have here a single dir with initial S) but still hidding the helper text that is no more followed by a warn (I can check this by hitting ArrowRight), complete \"Sync\" (either with letters or ArrowDown+ArrowRight), I see a new warning (must be about \"parent\" but still hidden by the drop-list now showing the list of my first 4 shares).... well now I understand better what was over-puzzling me : I zoomed-out firefox (Ctrl+- five times) so that I have a global  view of devices and folders, and this zoom also applied to \"Add folder\" popup, so the path drop-list was hiding the warnings :confused:\r\nOkay. No even sure putting the warning above the field would be a good idea as message appearing/disappearing would make the field jump down and up... or would it be possible to have the ~drop~list expand to the top instead of the bottom?\r\nWouldn't a confirmation popup be welcome for the cases when the warnings are displayed ? This may appear as belt and braces, but \"Are you really sure to create a nested share?\" would be the last thing ST can do to prevent ignorant users to run in trouble. This is mainly because with the new 0.14.20 \"...parent...\" warning, the users will mostly see warnings all the time... until* they do things the right way ... well... after all that's not so bad... no warning means no soucy... and warning means warning. Okay.\r\n \r\n*a funny thing is that the messages are often hidden by the path droplist\r\n** but the warning may stall them... that's what I wanted to say since the very beginning of this post
