seems to me that the current .stignore format makes it impossible to implement a simple use case: to only synchronize files with a certain file extension. I think there are two problems with the current format.\n\nFirst, I tried to mark the files with the desired extension as included:\n\n```\n!(?)*.jpg\n!(?)*.png\n```\n\nThis already did not work, as it is not possible to use both `!` and `(?)` as a prefix. I tried both `!(?)` and `(?)!`, none seemed to be working.\n\nSecond, I did not find a satisfying way to exclude the rest of the directory structure. Of course, simply\n\n```\n*\n```\n\ndoes not work, as it matches all directories, stopping syncthing from looking inside them. The next best thing is probably\n\n```\n*.*\n```\n\nbut this also excludes directories (and their contents) with a `.` inside. Plus, it does not exclude files without a `.`. What is necessary is a distinction between patterns that match directories and patterns that match files. I think the approach taken by git (http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) is sensible: everything that ends with a `/` matches directories only and everything else matches files only.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1127516871,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExMjc1MTY4NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1127516871","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-16T21:08:41Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"c2e0c6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1127516873,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTEyNzUxNjg3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1127516873","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-16T21:08:41Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
