I believe that the reason my\ncolleague asked me to contact the Syncthing project may be due to\nconcern that the currently-unmaintained gogo protobuf will break when Go\n1.19 is released, similarly to how quic-go broke with 1.18; however, I'm\nnot sure how likely that is.  To be fair, there are also at least the\nfollowing two alternatives:\n\n1. Perhaps form a team with other projects who use gogo protobuf, and\nadopt its maintenance?\n\n2. Perhaps form a team to work on a compatibility layer, similarly to\nMarten Seeman's qtls-go1-18?\n\nSpeaking from a Debian context, this second option would become\nnonviable if gogo protobuf itself fails to build with a future version\nof Go.\n\nRegards,\nNicholas\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1086948226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sten0","id":11372289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzcyMjg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11372289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sten0","html_url":"https://github.com/sten0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sten0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sten0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sten0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sten0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sten0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sten0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sten0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sten0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sten0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1086952893","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8247#issuecomment-1086952893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8247","id":1086952893,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAOCAEs5AyZW9","user":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-03T21:27:02Z","updated_at":"2022-04-03T21:27:02Z","body":"> concern that the currently-unmaintained gogo protobuf will break when Go 1.19 is released, similarly to how quic-go broke with 1.18;\r\n\r\nWhat's that concern based on? quic-go is not a good example, it's replicating internal go library code that needs to be adapted on every release, thus the qtls-<goversion> package.

Shouldn't a `dpkg-buildpackage --no-sign -d` work\r\n > from a checkout of your Salsa repo?\r\n\r\n Attempting to build Syncthing 1.18.6~ds1-1 (or newer) on Ubuntu 20.04\r\n will fail early during dependency resolution, at a minimum, because\r\n golang-github-marten-seemann-qtls-go1-18-dev exists exclusively in\r\n Debian sid/unstable as of two days ago.  If your interest is in\r\n providing a Debian-Policy-compliant package via PPA for Ubuntu 20.04,\r\n then I'd recommend the following general-case backporting strategy:\r\n\r\n 1. Backport (or ask to have it backported) 1.18.6~ds1-1 to bullseye,\r\n making adjustments as necessary.  Some dependencies may also need to be\r\n backported.  At the moment I'm focused on sid/unstable, but when I have\r\n free time I'd be happy to help with this effort.  At this point you'll\r\n have a package that works on Debian 11 (bullseye).\r\n\r\n 2. Branch 1.18.6~ds1-1~bpo11+1 to jammy-backports, make adjustments, and\r\n don't forget to use the Ubuntu `dch` options to generate the correct\r\n \"~ubuntu\" suffix.  Some dependencies may also need to be backported, and\r\n should be provided in the PPA.  If I remember correctly the state of\r\n Debian sid/unstable and testing is currently about 2.5 months newer than\r\n Ubuntu 22.04.  At this point you'll have a package that works on Ubuntu\r\n 22.04, that will provide smooth upgrades when users upgrade to Ubuntu\r\n 22.10 (fast stream) or Ubuntu 24.04 (LTS stream).\r\n\r\n 3. \"Sloppy\" is a Debian convention that indicates the packages is not\r\n taken from stable_release +1, but from what will become stable_release\r\n +2.  Upgrades skipping stable distribution releases are not supported,\r\n and this convention helps users and admins identify packages that may\r\n cause a \"failed to upgrade\" state.  I believe this is also why Ubuntu\r\n upgrade instructions recommend removing packages installed via PPAs\r\n before upgrading between major versions of the distribution.  Create a\r\n focal-backports-sloppy branch by branching from either:\r\n\r\n   a) jammy-backports (ideally the release tag), or\r\n   b) 1.18.6~ds1-1~bpo11+1, and apply the same adjustments as the\r\n   jammy-backports branch.\r\n\r\n 4. The next step is to apply another round of adjustments that may be\r\n required to backport a package that works on Ubuntu 22.04 to Ubuntu\r\n 20.04.\r\n\r\n Yeah, this method is a lot of work, but that's the cost of providing\r\n newer software with on LTS releases with verifiability, reproducibility,\r\n reusability by downstreams, etc--and without needing to provide a\r\n \"upgrades unsupported\" disclaimer.  This is the \"how\" of why upgrades\r\n between stable Debian releases go smoothly, and likely the reason why\r\n Ubuntu is based on Debian.\r\n\r\n If you're actually asking how I tested that protobuf was required, here\r\n is how to replicate my experiment.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n diff --git a/debian/control b/debian/control\r\n index b2f8931d3..b9cf9d708 100644\r\n --- a/debian/control\r\n
