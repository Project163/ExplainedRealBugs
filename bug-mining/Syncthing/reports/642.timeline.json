The button still doesn't work.  I need a javascript/angular/whatever front end guy to look at it and tell me what I'm doing wrong.   It's suppose to add the folder to the config when you press the button but, it's not adding anything to the config.  When you add to the config manually (via rest API or editing the xml file in program dir) then everything works fine.  So it's just the UI code that's not working.  probably just an easy one line of code somewhere.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4179/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1104675101,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTEwNDY3NTEwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1104675101","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"b49bbe82ddf3ab0eae2c1482f0974a116ac50108","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/b49bbe82ddf3ab0eae2c1482f0974a116ac50108","created_at":"2017-05-31T18:04:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1221860852,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEyMjE4NjA4NTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1221860852","actor":{"login":"viable-hartman","id":1300504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDA1MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1300504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viable-hartman","html_url":"https://github.com/viable-hartman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viable-hartman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viable-hartman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viable-hartman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viable-hartman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viable-hartman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viable-hartman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viable-hartman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viable-hartman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viable-hartman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2195e87f22d991cfc2cb1ff5fbd9418261ad6592","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/viable-hartman/syncthing/commits/2195e87f22d991cfc2cb1ff5fbd9418261ad6592","created_at":"2017-08-25T17:29:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1657623435,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2NTc2MjM0MzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1657623435","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-01T07:01:29Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1657623436,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTY1NzYyMzQzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1657623436","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_use
