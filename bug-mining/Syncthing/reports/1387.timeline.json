Having them delete \"their folder\" on \"their device\", recreate it, then share it with my device didn't help.\r\n\r\nIt is noted that the reverse setup (my device shares encrypted folder with device running 1.23.4) does not have this same issue.

hit by what could be a variation of this bug, possibly with a common root cause, since updating to 1.23.6, but probably specific to Windows:\r\n\r\nMy setup:\r\n\r\n3 devices: server (Debian 11, running 24/7), notebook (Windows 10), desktop (Ubuntu 22.04), all in the same LAN.\r\nAll devices are trusting each other and are sharing multiple shares.\r\nSome data (\"crypto\" share) must be encrypted on the server by organizational policy, but is o.k. to reside normally on desktop and notebook (their disks are fully encrypted, server's disk is not), so I'm using this setup for the crypto share:\r\n@Desktop, @Notebook: sharing normally to each other, but sharing encrypted to server\r\n@Server: share type is \"receive encrypted\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\nAll 3 devices consider all others connected and do exchange data.\r\n\r\nActual behaviour:\r\n\r\nServer and Notebook consider each other disconnected. That's the problem.\r\nDesktop is connecting fine to Server and Notebook.\r\nNotebook is connecting to Desktop but not to Server.\r\nServer is connecting to Desktop but not to Notebook.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe observation that only the Notebook is having issues makes me think that this is bug is Windows specific and encryption specific, because it works unencrypted between Windows and Linux and it works encrypted between Linux and Linux.\r\n\r\nLog at Server (repeats ca. every 15 seconds):\r\n2023-07-06 21:46:02 Established secure connection to (notebook-id) at (server-ip):22000-(notebook-ip):22000/quic-server/TLS1.3-TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256/LAN-P20\r\n2023-07-06 21:46:02 Device (ID of notebook) client is \"syncthing v1.23.6\" named \"(notebook's name)\" at (server-ip):22000-(notebook-ip):22000/quic-server/TLS1.3-TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256/LAN-P20\r\n2023-07-06 21:46:02 Connection to (notebook-id) at (server-ip):22000-(notebook-ip):22000/quic-server/TLS1.3-TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256/LAN-P20 closed: reading length: Application error 0x0 (remote): closing\r\n\r\nLog at Notebook (repeats ca. every 15 seconds):\r\n2023-07-06 21:46:02 Established secure connection to (server-id) at [::]:22000-(server-ip):22000/quic-client/TLS1.3-TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256/LAN-P20\r\n2023-07-06 21:46:02 Device (server-id) client is \"syncthing v1.23.6\" named \"(server's name)\" at [::]:22000-(server-ip):22000/quic-client/TLS1.3-TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256/LAN-P20\r\n2023-07-06 21:46:02 Connection to (server-id) at [::]:22000-(server-ip):22000/quic-client/TLS1.3-TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256/LAN-P20 closed: handling index-update for (crypto-share-id): chacha20poly1305: message authentication failed\r\n\r\nWhat I've tried but didn't help:\r\n- restarting Syncthing and machines, multiple times\r\n- Suspend Antivirus (ESET) on Notebook (Windows).

Bug unshares folders with untrusted devices if folder does not have an encryption password set, regardless of whether the folder is shared with the untrusted device as encrypted or not. Prevents sharing with untrusted devices in some cases where sharing would be encrypted.\r\n\r\nPatch preserves safety check but permits sharing folders with untrusted devices if they are shared as encrypted.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTested on 2023/07/31 as follows:\r\n- Compiled syncthing from main with and without this patch\r\n- Ran both syncthing binaries concurrently\r\n- Added both syncthing instances as mutually untrusted devices.\r\n- Shared one folder per instance with the other as encrypted\r\nAs expected, the unmodified syncthing instance automatically deleted its shared folder (consistent with v1.23.6 bugged behaviour). The patched syncthing instance did not (consistent with pre-v1.23.6 behaviour before safety check and bug was introduced).\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9012/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9984423384,"node_id":"CE_lADOAOCAEs5ql4twzwAAAAJTHjXY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/9984423384","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-08-02T07:14:55Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9984424265,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs5ql4twzwAAAAJTHjlJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/9984424265","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eed12f3ec51b0e261e5a58033f35161e6d72b496","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/eed12f3ec51b0e261e5a58033f35161e6d72b496","created_at":"2023-08-02T07:15:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9995232452,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs5ql4twzwAAAAJTwyTE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/9995232452","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9c2f1efe3ff5aeb4a36e7d6a41f6a8737bfabf02","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/calmh/syncthing/commits/9c2f1efe3ff5aeb4a36e7d6a41f6a8737bfabf02","created_at":"2023-08-03T07:00:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10043125460,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs5ql4twzwAAAAJWne7U","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/10043125460","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/us
