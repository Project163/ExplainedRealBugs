recently discussed in https://forum.syncthing.net/t/translating-syncthing/, this mangles the various translation files to interoperate with the repository on Hosted Weblate, to be found at https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/syncthing/gui/.  The live Weblate instance currently syncs with the source branch of this PR, and will be automatically rebased.\r\n\r\nStarting with some refactoring and housekeeping, the individual commits basically track how the Weblate database reached its current state: First importing already translated strings, then adding back the untranslated ones to apply a \"needs-editing\" label automatically.  All based on the latest Transifex state as of 2023-02-06.  Some language codes are not directly compatible and get adjusted automatically during future imports.\r\n\r\nThe only real conflict is `es-ES` Spanish (Spain), which has no equivalent on Weblate.  As we already have a plain `es` Spanish translation, strings from the former are copied to the latter where there is no previous translation.  The `es-ES` variant should be removed completely in the long term, if needed strings can be recovered from Git history by the Spanish translators.\r\n\r\nFinally, all translation updates already collected through Weblate, but not present on Transifex, get imported through this PR.  Not including them here would override the Weblate internal database.  Note that Weblate interacts directly with the JSON files committed in upstream Git, thus all languages will live there henceforth and the `transifexdl.go` script should no longer be used.\r\n\r\nThis is the step-by-step roadmap for a clean transition as far as I can tell.  Please comment on any steps I might have missed:\r\n\r\n- [x] 1. Disable Transifex download script to no longer run scheduled. (Not quite sure where that runs, changes to `build.sh` here should be enough.)\r\n- [x] 2. Check any builders for scheduled jobs that might still do Transifex-related stuff.\r\n- [x] 3. [optional] Block new translations from being entered on Transifex and announce the link to Weblate there instead.\r\n- [x] 4. Merge this PR.\r\n- [x] 5. Switch Weblate upstream repository setting to track the `main` branch instead.\r\n- [x] 6. Enable Webhook integration for GitHub according to https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/admin/continuous.html#github-setup\r\n- [x] 7. Make new forum announcement on https://forum.syncthing.net/\r\n  * [x] Pin new topic: https://forum.syncthing.net/t/translating-syncthing-on-weblate/19772\r\n  * [x] Link to it from the previous topic https://forum.syncthing.net/t/translating-syncthing/\r\n  * [x] Update the top post, pointing to the new topic.\r\n- [x] 8. Drop the `lang-es_ES.json` file in a separate follow-up PR: #8782\r\n- [x] 9. Prominently mention the dropped language and new place for translations in the release notes (#8781).\r\n\r\nFor roughly a few months after the transition, @acolomb volunteers to keep checking and incorporating remaining translation changes coming in through Transifex.  Unless / until step 3. above is implemented.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThere are only two references to Transifex in the docs, in a heavily outdated section about source code layout.  That should be cleaned up in general, but at least the reference will be removed in a separate docs PR once this is approved and merged.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8777/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1423819524","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8781#issuecomment-1423819524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8781","id":1423819524,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAOCAEs5U3cME","user":{"login":"acolomb","id":6996887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTY4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6996887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb","html_url":"https://github.com/acolomb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-09T08:37:17Z","updated_at":"2023-02-09T08:37:17Z","body":"Note
