what problem your new feature would solve\r\nIf an AV-software checks the validity of SSL-connections the strelaysrv gets catched because of a selfsign certificate.\r\nIf a person checks that, the organisation name in the certificate is strange and it is not obvious that it belongs to syncthing.\r\nI blocked the connections first because I didn't trust the certificate because of the long expire time.\r\n - how or why you think it is generally useful (i.e., not just for you)\r\nA organisation field filled with O:\"Syncting\" or CN: \"Syncting relay server\" would make the certificate much more trustworthy and a person would recognize it. \r\n - what alternatives or workarounds you considered\r\nA dialog on the first startup that encourages you to install the certificate.\r\n\r\nI attached a screenshot of my av-software warning me about the connection (its in german so sorry for that)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6715246/98529513-ffa21200-227d-11eb-9a70-4c3aeffe158b.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7108/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
