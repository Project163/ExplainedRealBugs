However, peer A will keep showing 'Up to date' for the remote device in its gui.\r\nIf now a byte is added to the problematic file, peer A will show 'Syncing (99%, 1 B)' as expected in its gui.\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour for me would be that peer A reflects the out-of-sync state of peer B even when syncing zero-byte files, for example, as suggested by imsodin, by displaying 'Syncing (99%, 0 B)'.\r\n\r\nEven though I discovered the behaviour due to a filename length limit on one peer, I'd expect it to occur with any issue that prevents the file from being synced on a remote.\r\nI used 1.16.1 and also 1.17, both on Alpine and Windows, but imsodin was able to confirm the problem looking at the code, so I don't think this is relevant.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7741/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
