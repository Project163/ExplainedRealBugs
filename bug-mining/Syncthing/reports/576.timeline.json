ran into this as well, but with existing symlinks (not just new ones as @calmh described). I upgraded one machine (the always-on server) to 0.14.14 and booted up my desktop machine to upgrade it. I have syncthing set to launch on login and started getting notices of files deleted. Thinking this odd as I hadn't deleted anything since the machines were connected last, I stopped syncthing and upgraded to 0.14.14. Now I was seeing reports (like above) of invalid symlinks (even though they were present on the server side).\r\n\r\nCut to 12+ hours later, and I am in front of my laptop that is part of the sync group, disabling syncthing before allowing it to connect to the internet. I have 83 symlinks in the synced directory. Checking on the desktop, I have zero. Syncthing had removed all the symlinks on the desktop.\r\n\r\nAs a recovery measure,  I tarballed up all the symlinks on the laptop before upgrading and letting it sync, then manually removed the symlinks on the server (where they were still present) and restored the tarball and now the 3 machines all show as \"Up to date\" and have their 83 symlinks.\r\n\r\nSome things I have noted about the symlinks:\r\n- some were dangling symlinks to either files or directories\r\n- some were to valid files or directories\r\n- some were relative, some were full-path\r\n- age of the symlink seems to have nothing to do with which ones were listed as failed\r\n- only some of the list (53 iirc) were shown as \"Failed\" in the syncthing UI despite none of them being synchronized.\r\n- all had been synchronized prior to the upgrade, none were \"new\" to be synced\r\n\r\nI still have one further machine (another laptop) which needs to be updated to 0.14.14, and I am wondering if it will cause me trouble. Will actually hold off on booting and updating it now in case I can test something for @calmh, but a bit concerned that a \"fix\" introduced a (if not for the gtk gui) quiet data-loss in my environment. Fortunately I had a way to recover, but seems like the upgrade needed more safety code added to either cause syncthing to stop on boot, or fail to sync rather than wiping out data.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/267396820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"javmorin","id":56076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MDc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javmorin","html_url":"https://github.com/javmorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javmorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javmorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javmorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javmorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javmorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javmorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javmorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javmorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javmorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":895611027,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODk1NjExMDI3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/895611027","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-12-15T18:00:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":895611028,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDg5NTYxMTAyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/895611028","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-12-15T18:00:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/267428438","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3802#issuecomment-267428438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3802","id":267428438,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzQyODQzOA==","user":{"login":"bradbulger","id":1234634,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzQ2MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1234634?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradbulger","html_url":"https://github.com/bradbulger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradbulger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradbulger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradbulger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradbulger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradbulger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradbulger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradbulger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradbulger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradbulger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-15T20:00:32Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T20:00:32Z","body":"I
