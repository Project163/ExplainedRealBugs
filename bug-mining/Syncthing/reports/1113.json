By enlarging the rescan interval in Syncthing to a reasonably large value, like for instance 24h, the disks can be spun down for a substantial portion of the day.\r\n\r\nHowever, when staggered file versioning is used, disks spin up hourly to remove file versions in the `.stversions` folder that have expired.\r\n\r\nIt has been [suggested in the forum](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/synchthing-prevents-disk-spindown/14446/8) that using a single hook to update the staggered file versioning and rescan the folder provides control over disk access by adjusting a single parameter.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6313/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6313/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
