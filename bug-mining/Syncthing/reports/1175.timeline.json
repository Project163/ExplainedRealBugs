actually has a proper bug as a cause :) \r\n\r\nWe do reload the UI when the theme was changed by the user, in the success callback of the api call changing the config. However that call errors out, as it waits for the config change to take place, and while doing so the config change restarts the api server, terminating all outstanding api calls. Now we are giving the API a chance to shut down gracefully, and thus the config change succeeds.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7157/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4042875879,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDA0Mjg3NTg3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4042875879","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"e1b958284eb27a7d54f57ebcbb0c685407b09f33","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/e1b958284eb27a7d54f57ebcbb0c685407b09f33","created_at":"2020-11-26T14:49:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4046166690,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQwNDYxNjY2OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4046166690","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-27T13:35:45Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.12.1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4216489854,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQyMTY0ODk4NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4216489854","actor":{"login":"SimonPickup","id":18005537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDA1NTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18005537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonPickup","html_url":"https://github.com/SimonPickup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonPickup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonPickup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonPickup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonPickup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonPickup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonPickup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonPickup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonPickup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimonPickup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ee4471bce68daadbae2cd050de8f2cbf06c55dbb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MobiusSync/syncthing/commits/ee4471bce68daadbae2cd050de8f2cbf06c55dbb","created_at":"2021-01-18T06:53:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5679833310,"node_id":"LE_lADOAOCAEs4smqECzwAAAAFSi2De","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/5679833310","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"h
