happens to three virtual machines running centOS 7 and syncthing 1.3.0 .\r\nIn the options, selecting **specifically** \"No upgrades\" when \"Stable releases and release candidates\" is selected and in effect, then saving causes the \"You have unsaved changes\" popup to appear, making it impossible to switch directly from \"Stable and candidates\" to \"No upgrades\".\r\nIt's as if clicking outside the window or \"Close\".\r\nTo select it, I had to switch first from \"Stable and candidates\" to \"Stable only\", save, then go back and select \"No updates\", then save.\r\nNot a
