I don't know which version I started with, but I know the dates, so maybe you can tell.\n\nHere is my setup in more detail. It began like this:\n\n**Source machine**\nHP Pavillion g4 notebook running Windows 7 Professional x64.\nInstalled Syncthing on 2016-01-20 (I know because I mailed me the ID)\n3-4gb backup folder set as Master: C:\\Beta\\Backup\n320gb Samsung HDD, single NTFS partition.\nRunning Avast antivirus.\n\n**Target machine**\nDell desktop running WIndows 7 Professional x64.\nInstalled Syncthing on 2016-01-20 (same day)\nFolder synched to: F:\\Apoio\\Beta\\Backup\n1.5tb Western Digital Caviar Green HDD, 460gb NTFS partition.\nRunning Panda antivirus.\n\nIt operated like this until February, then I migrated the Source machine to Linux:\n\n**Source machine**\nHP Pavillion g4 notebook running Linux Mint 17.3.\nInstalled Syncthing on 2016-02-15\n3-4gb backup folder set as Master: /home/beta/Backup\n320gb Samsung HDD, 286gb ext4 partition.\n\nThe Target machine remained the same until last week, when I decided to migrate it to Linux as well. Then I begin sorting the backup out to prepare for formatting, and I noticed the files were missing. There were 32 .mp3 files, and 12 .docx files missing. I then copied them with a thumb drive, but the copy failed because of filepath limitations, and I noticed that the files had very long names.\n\n**Additional information**\nThe computers are synched through the internet, they are rarely together in a LAN, because the notebook stays at my workplace.\n\nI never got an Out of Sync error for my Backup folder, regardless if the Source machine was running Windows or Mint. I did get Out of Sync errors for other folders, and they happened because I tampered with them, like deleting files on the Target side, but I never messed with the Backup.\n\nOn all Windows machines I was running the SyncTrayzor client with Syncthing. When I switched to Linux I used Syncthing just with the Web UI.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/214890902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BethAr","id":5732386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzIzODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5732386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethAr","html_url":"https://github.com/BethAr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethAr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethAr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethAr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethAr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethAr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethAr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethAr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethAr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethAr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/214893650","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3012#issuecomment-214893650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3012","id":214893650,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNDg5MzY1MA==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-26T21:33:38Z","updated_at":"2016-04-26T21:33:38Z","body":"The

well, I just reproduced it. I don't have the Mint machine here, so I used this one as Source:\n\nLenovo 3000 n200 running Manjaro/Xfce 15.12\nSyncthing v0.12.21\nSource folder set as Master at: /home/beta/Teste\n80gb Hitachi HDD, 50gb ext4 partition.\n\nTarget is the same as above.\nTarget folder: F:\\Apoio\\Beta\\Teste\n\n**Results**\nIf I add a file with a very long name (255 chars), I get _no errors_, in the Source or the Target. The file does arrive at the Target, but I can't do nothing with it there. Windows will scrub it with chkdsk later, if I recall.\n\nIf add a file with either a `:` or `?` in the name, I do get a warning at the Target machine, but I get no errors at the Source machine, and even though the file _never_ arrived at the Target, the Source machine still reports the folder as Up to Date.\n\nI only got an error reported at the Source machine (Out of Sync error), from a invalid filename, when I added a file with a `\\` in the name, which arrived as a folder in the Target. Overriding the folder with the red button did nothing, I had to delete it manually to sort things out.\n\nSo the issue stands: I get no warning at the Source that there was a problem at the Target, even though the Source is set as Master. I had to RDP into the Target machine, which runs headless, and open up a browser to see the problems.

you are saying the file does arrive.\nThe fact that you can't do anything with it or the fact that chkdsk decides to nuke it is not really our fault.\n\nFrom our perspective, I believe syncthing has delivered what it has promised to do, which is getting the file there, so from it's perspective everything is there and up to date.\n\nAlso, if the file was removed by chkdsk, syncthing would propagate the removal back to source, which did not seem to happen looking at your initial story, so I am not sure I am buying chkdsk removing
