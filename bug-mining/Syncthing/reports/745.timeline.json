upgrading the app to 0.10.5 I encountered a serious showstopper that renders the app unusable. It occurs both using experimental root and not using the experimental root feature.\r\n\r\nReproduction:\r\n- Clear app data and caches (if the app was not fresh installed)\r\n- Setup folder \"/storage/emulated/0\" as syncthing folder read-write with default settings and scan interval 10 minutes (you can use another scan interval as well - I used this one)\r\n- Setup the ignore list before the first scan to ignore special folder\r\n`(?i)/.android_secure\r\n(?i)/Android/data/**/cache\r\n(?i)/Android/data/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/files/*\r\n(?i)/Android/data/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid.debug/files/*\r\n(?i)/com.infosysta.mobile.jirapro\r\n(?i)/DCIM/.thumbnails\r\n(?i)/Domoticz\r\n(?i)/LOST.DIR\r\n(?i)/Sygic/Maps\r\n(?i)/Tasker/log/*\r\n(?i)/TWRP/Backups`\r\n- Syncthing walks the folder - displays \"Scanning\".... \r\n- Scanning reaches 100% after some seconds (Note - I have only ~ 1.500 files with the above mentioned ignore patterns) and the scan finishes.\r\n- Folder displays state as \"current\" (translated from german)\r\n- I took a note of how many files are displayed for that folder in the syncthing web GUI = 1.500 files.\r\n- After around 10 seconds, the \"scanning\" appears again (I did not add, change, delete files).\r\n- The folder is rescanned \"by syncthing itself\" without any user interaction\r\n- The scan finishes again very quickly after reaching \"100%\"\r\n- Folder displays state as \"current\" (translated from german)\r\n- I took a note of how many files are displayed for that folder in the syncthing web GUI = 3.000 files.\r\n- The file count is twice as high as after the first scan.\r\n- Now the folder stays \"idle\" until the rescan interval passed by.\r\n- I took a full log with STTRACE=scanner (enabled before the test, attached)\r\n\r\nLooking at the log \"as being no expert\", I suspect it is scanning the folder named \".\" within \"/storage/emulated/0\" which causes the double amount of files in the web gui report of the folder. At first glance, the first \"real to hash\" is called for e.g. \"somefolder/somefile.txt\" and later, during the \"second scan\" for \"/somefolder/somefile.txt\".\r\n\r\n### Version

up until 0.14.44 at which point it became a problem. Now those devices have index entries that are not accepted in other places. So we might want Android users upgraded to 0.14.46-rc.1 when we release that, with the fix for
