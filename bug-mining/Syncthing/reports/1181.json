All the methods that supposedly close it, just tell the model that it's closed and potentielly send a Closed BEP msg, but don't actually close the connection.\r\n\r\nThe type hierarchy looks like this:  \r\nmodel has: `connections.Service` implemented by `completeConn{internalConn, protocol.Connection}` and `internalConn` are wrappers of the concrete underlying tls connection type (tcp, quic, ...).  \r\nThe protocol connections gets a reader and a writer based on `internalConn`. An option would be to instead pass it a `io.ReadWriteCloser`, based on the same.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
