am having an issue where Syncthing-android resets file modificaiton times to the time of initial sync on the Android device. These modification times are propagated through the cluster. I consider this a data loss.\n\nMy cluster consists of four machines:\nandroid 0.4.3 syncthing v0.8.20 (this project)\ndarwin-amd64-v0.8.21\nlinux-armv7-v0.8.21\nlinux-amd64-v.0.8.21\n\nHere is how I reproduce this bug.\n\nI stop syncthing on every machine in the cluster. I `rm ./*` from within the repo directory on each machine. Now the repo exists but is completely empty. Then, I `rsync -a` my files into the repo of one machine (specifically, the darwin v0.8.21) from a backup. These files have diverse modification times.\n\nWhen I start the cluster without the android machine, the files sync normally, propagating the correct modification times to each machine in the cluster.\n\nWhen I add the android machine with an empty repo, it syncs the files from the cluster to itself, but it erroneously updates the modification time of the received files to the present time. These updated modification times are then propagated to the rest of the cluster.\n\nModification times are important information to me and I don't think it's normal behavior to update them when syncing.\n\nPlease let me know if I can provide any logs or debug traces to assist you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing-android/issues/69/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing-android/issues/69/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":178037737,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MTc4MDM3NzM3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/178037737","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-10-14T06:33:19Z","rename":{"from":"puller : final: chtimes invalid argument","to":"Option to not sync mtime"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":178037740,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE3ODAzNzc0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/178037740","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-10-14T06:33:21Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"009800"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/58996289","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/831#issuecomment-58996289","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/831","id":58996289,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4OTk2Mjg5","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-14T06:36:17Z","updated_at":"2014-10-14T06:36:17Z","body":"Changed the issue description. It would be nice if syncing could run without syncing mtime, similar to how we can run without syncing permissions.
