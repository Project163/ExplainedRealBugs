Of couse, this was done silently and I am sure you were not aware of this when migrating. \r\n\r\nWe have been in contact with Font-Awesome developpers (see #[902981](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=902981#76)) and they have responded clearly:\r\n > the first question to get out of the way is: “Will Font Awesome open source their build tool?”\r\n>\r\n> And the answer is no for the time being.\r\n\r\nThis makes it impossible, for example, for Font-Awesome v5 to be included in Debian.\r\n\r\nThe community has already reacted to this, and the Fork-Awesome project was created, which is a fork of Font-Awesome v4, back when the build system was still available:\r\n - https://forkawesome.github.io/Fork-Awesome/\r\n - https://github.com/ForkAwesome/Fork-Awesome\r\n\r\nI have gotten in touch with the guys at Fork-Awesome and they have been open consider a v5 compatibility layer, which they have already started working on, making it much easier to migrate to Fork-Awesome for Font-Awesome v5 users. See the following discussion: https://github.com/ForkAwesome/Fork-Awesome/issues/112\r\n\r\nI have tested this compatibility layer with Syncthing and have gotten positive results. However, if Syncthing starts using icons that are not included in Fork-Awesome, then there is nothing that a compatibility layer will be able to do.\r\n\r\nWould Syncthing consider migrating to Fork-Awesome?","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5236/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5236/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
