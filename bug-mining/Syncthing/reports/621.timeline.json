I understand correctly after reading this \\~bug\\~ plus the documentation,\r\nP _r_ being the Pairs list at Remote R side for Folder F _lr_ shared with Local L whose pairs list for F _lr_ is P _l_, setting R as an Introducer (let's then call R=I) will populate P _l_ with P _r_ - P _l_ subset as long as R remains I, and only as a consequence of this wanted behaviour will the L _g_ local global list of known devices be populated with additional P _r_ - P _l_ (to prevent \"Folder {folderName}({folderID}) error : unknown device {deviceName}({deviceID})\").\r\nI leave beside what happens in the scenario when no longer R=I.\r\nIf I explained correctly, you see I've just understood Introducer concept :)\r\nSo it appears making the UI text less verbose is not possible (since clarification here requires the additional \\~concept\\~ of shared folder pairs list) without using a yet known algebra. This is worse if we want to anticipate the questions that raised to my mind when I first wandered what is this, namely the question of time : what will happen later if .....? For this I like the @go2null suggestion using the future (will). Maybe better, the verb could be _will update_, then it slightly addresses/raises questions about removal (both F _lr_ & L _g_ entries).\r\n\r\nOr maybe, like we yet have elsewhere for other too complicated options to explain and fit in the GUI, a small \"Allow device {deviceName}({deviceID}) to update **all** my shared folder's pairs lists whose it is yet a member with devices it knows and I don't\" with a link to the documentation.\r\n\r\nFun to you, but damned markdown that won't allow concatenate normal_italic_ nor indices/exponents\r\n
