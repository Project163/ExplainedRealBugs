Here's a log that I just captured:\n\n```\n[MAPXM] 2014/12/02 13:44:42.953451 staggered.go:288: DEBUG: Waiting for lock on  /home/mhw/projects/.stversions\n[MAPXM] 2014/12/02 13:44:42.953484 staggered.go:319: DEBUG: archiving /home/mhw/projects/i915-crash/syslog\n[MAPXM] 2014/12/02 13:44:42.954622 staggered.go:337: DEBUG: moving to /home/mhw/projects/.stversions/i915-crash/syslog~20140509-113558\n[MAPXM] 2014/12/02 13:44:42.957397 staggered.go:226: DEBUG: Versioner: Expiring versions [/home/mhw/projects/.stversions/i915-crash/syslog~20140509-113558 /home/mhw/projects/.stversions/i915-crash/syslog~20140509-113558]\n[MAPXM] 2014/12/02 13:44:42.958447 staggered.go:268: DEBUG: too many files in step -> delete /home/mhw/projects/.stversions/i915-crash/syslog~20140509-113558\n```\n\nI think the problem is that the list of files passed to `expire` includes the newly created archive file twice. `expire` then sees this as two separate backups in a time period when only one is required and so it deletes the file.\n\nWhy does `expire` get the filename passed to it twice? Because files without file extensions will be matched by both of the glob patterns used in [this section of code](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/internal/versioner/staggered.go#L344..L356). Removing duplicates from the list prior to calling `expire` should fix it I think.\n\nBased on a quick test the simple versioner doesn't have this issue because its expiry logic is simpler.\n","closed_by":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1063/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
