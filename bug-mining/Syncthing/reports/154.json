Add a pattern to `.stignore`.\n2. Hit _[Rescan]_ in GUI and notice the change of Local/Global state file count\n3. Remove the pattern you've added in `.stignore`\n4. Hit _[Rescan]_ in GUI and notice the local/global state file count isn't changing.\n\nTried rescanning, restarting, none worked. The only way Syncthing recognizes them again is if I **completely** empty the `.stignore` file. As soon as I add even one single character in it, everything is ignored again. This definitely feels like it's cached somewhere...\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/816/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
