Problem\r\n\r\nI've noticed that more often than I'd expect, I have devices connected over a (slow) relay when they can have a (fast) local connection. It's easy to miss, but when big syncs take a long time, you'll start looking. I've seen this multiple times, for a variety of reasons. One time I entered the wrong tcp://ip-address so dynamic was used. Another time I used a laptop at the office first and the 24/7 online home server never used the local ip when I was on the home wifi, until I restarted syncthing on the home server. And just now I noticed that a remote connection with a very fast optical fiber was using a slow relay for the past year.\r\n\r\n### Feature\r\n\r\nIt would help to see **a label**, icon or indicator of sorts to show if a relay was used, or a direct remote connection, or a LAN connection, and some polite way of indicating that a direct connection is better than a relay.  This way you'd immediately see if it is what you expected or not. This illustrates what I mean (although emoji's are not the implementation I'd suggest):\r\n\r\n> ### Remote Devices\r\n>\r\n> [[device1]       [LAN 🤩] [Up to Date]]\r\n> [[device2]       [LAN 🤩] [Up to Date]]\r\n> [[device3]       [direct 😄] [Up to Date]]\r\n> [[device4]       [relay 🙂] [Up to Date]]\r\n\r\nEncouraging users to check their connections this way also alleviates relays that provide an invaluable service from peers that unknowingly unnecessarily burden those relays when all they need to do is a restart, config change or port forward. This way they get a faster sync, and the relays are free to service users that really need it. I'd prefer short concise labels, but any indicator would be helpful.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
