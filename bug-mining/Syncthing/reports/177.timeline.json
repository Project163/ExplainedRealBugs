Let's assume we have 50 files each 2 GB (no subdirectories).\nIn worst case I create a new repo from the directory. Syncthing has to index all 50 files at once. That sounds good, but on a hdd it results in a very low reading performance (assuming the index itself is on a seperate hdd oder ssd) because of the multiple file handles which all want to read their whole 2 GB.\nThe best case would be a single thread reading file by file sequentially and all files aren't physically fragmentent on the hdd. The hdd could read without unnecessary seeking resulting in highest transfer rates (typically 80-120 MB per second).\n\nKnowing this issue, I have started this process last night for about 90 GB. From the logs I could see, it took about 4 hours and 30 minutes. That would make a reading rate of roughly 6 MB/s (and of course terribly hdd-noise). Assuming a fixed reading delta at 100 MB/s sequential reading, the whole process could have been finished in less than 20 minutes (if there are no further bottlenecks).\n\nI hope I could make my case clear for you.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/69004514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Tiefkuehlpizze","id":5569743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Njk3NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5569743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze","html_url":"https://github.com/Tiefkuehlpizze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/69006938","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1199#issuecomment-69006938","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1199","id":69006938,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MDA2OTM4","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-07T10:58:47Z","updated_at":"2015-01-07T10:58:47Z","body":"Ah

could add such a setting. I'd think most modern operating systems handle it quite well, seeing the four streaming workloads and doing the appropriate readahead, and keeping the filesystem layer \"saturated\" with requests it can reorder and prioritize is usually the best way to get the most performance out of it. (Of course there are exceptions. My syncthing-running boxes are either SSD laptops or ZFS arrays, both of which respond well to this, better than a single spinning disk for sure.) And of course this is a bit selfish, as it doesn't necessarily \"leave\" much performance on the table for other tasks.\n\nBut a `hashers` setting per folder, symmetrical with the existing `copiers`, `pullers` etc settings would work fine. Maybe default to 2 or something more conservative. I wouldn't suggest exposing it in the GUI (either) as it's an advanced setting most users probably shouldn't be fiddling with... At least until the config GUI is refactored.\n\n(As an aside, maybe the `finishers` config should go away now that the finisher does almost no work and there is no gain in parallellizing it.)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/69025208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/69031148","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1199#issuecomment-69031148","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1199","id":69031148,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5MDMxMTQ4","user":{"login":"Tiefkuehlpizze","id":5569743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Njk3NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5569743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze","html_url":"https://github.com/Tiefkuehlpizze","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tiefkuehlpizze/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-07T14:48:51Z","updated_at":"2015-01-07T14:48:51Z","body":"Sounds good to me.
