All fields were filled by the Syncthing App (not via Web GUI).\n\nBut by playing around with all my repositories, I found a pattern: paths like \n/storage/emulated/0/... (ASUS)    or    /mnt/sdcard/... (ACER)\ndo NOT work. Save button is always inactive. But one cannot modify the path once the repository is created, so dead end.\nThe point is: such paths are generated by the Syncthing for Android App when I navigate and select the target folder.\n\nWork around: create repository using Web GUI and enter paths like\n/sdcard/...\ninstead. This makes the Save button active!\n\nSo I think the issue is: on both my devices (Acer E350, ASUS TF300T), the App creates path patterns which will disable the Save button in the Web GUI. This holds at least for folders on the (internal) SD card on the devices mentioned above.

I think the deal here is that the old/current version of the Android wrapper saves the config.xml without a rescan interval, which is kind of fine since the config loader defaults it to 60 s.
