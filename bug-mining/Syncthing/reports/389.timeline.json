Let me explain why it is how it is and then we can see. :)\n\nWhen we get an incoming connection, we get their certificate as part of the TLS negotiation. If we don't recognize that certificate we drop the connection, and we pop up the prompt in question. The remote name gets sent in the first message of an allowed connection, but we dropped the connection before we got that data.\n\nIt's a nice safety net that we don't interpret any data sent by unrecognized devices. Perhaps we have a protocol parser vulnerability where a malformed message can cause us to crash, expose private data or do bad things. Of course we do our damndest to avoid that. But as it is, by avoiding to even peek at data sent by someone we don't explicitly trust it's much _much_ harder to exploit any vulnerability we might have.\n\nOne possibility that came to mind now that we _could_ use is to set the name in the certificate from the hostname at generation time. That way the name is available to the recipient, but the name wouldn't be changeable by the user other than by regenerating the certificate (thus getting a new device ID). It might still be better than nothing.\n\n(Of course, allowing the user to set a name already in the accept dialog would be fine, that's just a UI change.)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/111014373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/111017776","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1929#issuecomment-111017776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1929","id":111017776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMTAxNzc3Ng==","user":{"login":"jpjp","id":6050800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTA4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6050800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpjp","html_url":"https://github.com/jpjp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpjp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpjp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpjp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpjp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpjp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpjp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpjp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpjp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpjp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-11T07:03:43Z","updated_at":"2015-06-11T07:03:43Z","body":"Makes
