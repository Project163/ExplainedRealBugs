questions:\n\nAs the auto upgrades can strike at random, it makes sense to emit an event indicating that we are about to restart. Now at the UI, we could catch that event and show a modal while the restart is in progress and then refresh the page.\n\nBut the issue is that the user might be in a middle of something (for example editing ignores), and we don't want to suddenly destroy all of his work by doing a refresh.\n\nI guess it's fine to actually restart syncthing as all the state is in the browser, not in the application, but then again, the underlying application has changed, so how do you know that the action you are doing is an action the application supports?\n\nThe current way I've done it is basically it closes any modals that were open, and gives you a new modal with a 10 seconds countdown which you have the opportunity to cancel (or you can just click refresh yourself). \n\nThis seems to work, but I am starting to think that perhaps _fighting windmills_ and trying to tackle problems that do not exist?\n\nAlso, in the above scenario, perhaps if no modals are currently open, I could perhaps just blindly refresh without any prior notification to the user?\nOr perhaps it should be a non-cancel'able modal which is shown for 2 seconds to give an indication of what the hell is happening?

to having this functionality, optional and on by default, with a warning a few minutes before it happens, and only when idle.\n\n2 things to think about:\nA- Coordination with installer scripts:  What if the underlying infrastructure also handles updates? How to avoid issues?  Ex.: F-Droid installs 0.9.x which then self-updates to 0.9.y, but F-Droid doesn't know and didn't do other stuff it should be doing.\n\nB- The future introduction of Long Term Support (LTS) versions.\nThe current release cycle of Syncthing is very fast. This is great and expected given the age of the project. Each release brings new features, bug fixes and perhaps security fixes. However, as the user base grows, and Syncthing gets integrated in other apps (I myself have plans in this direction), there will be a desire for a more stable branch, which has just security fixes (and perhaps critical bug fixes) but not new features. Certainly not new features which have the potential to introduce regressions.\n\nHere is a good explanation of why & how to have LTS versions: https://info.tiki.org/Version+Lifecycle \n\nA key benefit of LTS is that it makes it easier to make big changes in the future. There could (will!) also be a desire in the future to update the protocol. I know it's \"supposed\" to always be backward compatible once 1.0 comes out, but it's nice to keep our options open.\nhttps://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/protocol/PROTOCOL.md\n\nThere very well may be a requirement in the future that all nodes be of version 2.0 for the fancy new stuff to work. \n\nNow, back to auto-updates. If & when LTS versions are introduced, there should be a way to select either regular releases (new features) or LTS (security fixes mostly).\n\nBest regards,\n\nM
