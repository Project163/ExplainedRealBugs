Why? Syncthing syncs file. It shouldn't care about it's content. It should not analyze them and alter them based on arbitrary conditions. It should just replicate the directory just like copy-pasting would do (but two-way, and keeping the newest version). If your data refers to data external to your repository that's _your_ desicion.\n\n@AudriusButkevicius: Which means that if I used dropbox, **both my directories trees would be different**. I don't want two different trees: I'm using a syncronization tool! Not only that, but their size could differ massively.\n\nThat would also result in other supercomplicated scenarios.\n- What do you sync if the symlink is broken?\n- What do you sync if you don't have read access to the destination.\n- What do you sync if the destination is a non-regular and non-directory file.\n- What do you do if the symlink is a directory with more symlinks?\n- What do you do if the symlink is a directory with recursive (or infinite) loops?\n\nFinally, when syncing directory trees, it's _very_ common to use symlinks when we want to _avoid_ recurring into part of the tree and syncing it (eg: syncing ~/.config, and having ~/.config/syncthing be a symlink to somewhere else).\n\nMeanwhile, there's no evidence that altering the file tree and copying the destination's content could be of any use under any scenario. No use-case has been provided of when that may be useful.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/61480617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"WhyNotHugo","id":730811,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDgxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730811?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo","html_url":"https://github.com/WhyNotHugo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WhyNotHugo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":187346234,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg3MzQ2MjM0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/187346234","actor":{"login":"klingtnet","id":1538057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet","html_url":"https://github.com/klingtnet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-11-03T14:00:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":187346235,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4NzM0NjIzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/187346235","actor":{"login":"klingtnet","id":1538057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet","html_url":"https://github.com/klingtnet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klingtnet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-11-03T14:00:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":187346236,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg3MzQ2MjM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/187346236","actor":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-11-03T14:00:41Z",

that is not what we are (or rather I am) aiming for.\nI literally intend to do symlink -> symlink transfers, regardless of whether the link is valid or not, with perhaps slash conversions, but that's about it.\n\nIt will obviously won't work if you have absolute paths (unless the layout is the same), but should work for relative paths even cross Windows and Linux, the only caveat is that we'll need admin privileges on Windows which I haven't solved yet. \nI guess we could fail to create the symlinks and warn the user, but then I am left to work out how to achieve 'in sync' state and stop repeatedly transferring it.\n\nI guess we could mitigate the problem by embedding a manifest into the binary, but since the builds are produced on Linux, I don't think the relevant utilities exist.\n\nThe other thing I haven't worked out is how to distinguish between a directory symlink and file symlink on Linux, as they seem to be the same thing, where on Windows they are different things.\nEspecially when the target doesn't exist...\n\nSo any input on the issues above would be
