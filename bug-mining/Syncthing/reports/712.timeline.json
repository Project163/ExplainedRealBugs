As a first step in the direction of better restorability I'd suggest changing the folder & naming scheme inside the .stversions folder. This poses the problem that after accidentally deleting a big folder (which can also happen with some kind of mounting problems) one has to write a script to rename thousands of files. Simple file renaming tools don't work, because Syncthing generally doesn't delete several thousand files within the same second, so the last digits of the timestamp are different.\r\n\r\nThis could be completely avoided by moving the timestamps from the filename into subfolders of the .stversions folder.\r\nThe current folder- and filenamestructure looks like this:\r\n\r\n.stversions/complete/original/path/originalfilename~YYYYMMDD-hhmmss.ext\r\n\r\nI would suggest to put all files from within 1 day increments in the same folder with subfolders for hours, minutes and seconds:\r\n.stversions/YYYYMMDD/hhmmss/complete/original/path/originalfilename.ext\r\n\r\nThis way the first folder level doesn't get an unreasonable number of subfolders, while one is probably interested in all deleted files from one day, which can be easily found and merged back together.\r\n\r\nIf you would consider implementing this (imho rather easy but important step in improving the restorability), would you prefer this to be the new default and existing .stversions folders will be ported to the new format. Or would you prefer adding a new option?\r\nIf the latter, one could also let the user declare the preferred structure without much additional effort.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/339497151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"generalmanager","id":6797943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTc5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6797943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager","html_url":"https://github.com/generalmanager","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1310905291,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTMxMDkwNTI5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1310905291","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-10-25T22:46:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1310905292,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEzMTA5MDUyOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1310905292","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-10-25T22:46:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/339498127","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2599#issuecomment-339498127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2599","id":339498127,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTQ5ODEyNw==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":

And that with minimal coding effort. No UI needed, it should just be a step in this direction to make restoration easier. I can also open a new ticket, if you'd prefer that.\r\nWith the described usecase one generally has:\r\n- Knowledge of the approximate day+time of deletion. Even if not, du -h -d 2 will give a good idea when big files/lots of files were deleted.\r\n- Local file/folder structure mostly intact, but missing lots of files scattered across the file system or one/several directories with lots of subdirectories.\r\n- A ton of renamed files in the .stversions folder of another device, but the ones I'm interested in are bunched together with lots of old files I don't want. So I have to scan every folder to approximate the period it took to delete the files and sync the deletion progress to the other device. Then I have to cobble together a script to hopefully select the right versions and rename them, bearing in mind that most of them have different timestamps.\r\n\r\nWith my proposal the workflow would be this:\r\n- Choose the folder of the approximate deletion, maybe narrow it down with du -h -d 1.\r\n- Copy the whole folder from the remote device to the local device.\r\n- Merge folders by copying/rsync/whatever. No renaming and very little directory scanning involved.\r\n\r\nSo for the usecase I laid out a boolean option in the advanced options would be enought to switch between the current and the proposed folder structure. Either deleting or porting the existing .stversions folder, depending on how much time you are willing to spend on this. But if it's not too much effort, custom structures with variables for path, file name and timestamp would be awesome, as I'm sure some people would prefer something else depending on their usecase.\r\n\r\n@AudriusButkevicius As @imsodin wrote, it depends on the use case. If you are looking for one or few specific file(s) and know it's/their destination the current setup is preferable.\r\n\r\nIf you don't remember the exact name and path, I'd assume my proposal would work better, because you are probably missing it (why else would you look for it) so you should have a general idea when the file disappeared. Then you don't have to search in every folder and subfolder (like now) to look for it. But this is probably an edge case, depending on whether or not the approximate time of deletion is known.\r\n\r\nBut for the use case I layed out (accidental or bug related deletion of big directories) the current way is truly a pita, as all filenames are modified, but with different timestamps.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/339743201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"generalmanager","id":6797943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTc5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6797943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager","html_url":"https://github.com/generalmanager","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1312478601,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTMxMjQ3ODYwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1312478601","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-10-26T17:41:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1312478602,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEzMTI0Nzg2MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1312478602","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-10-26T17:41:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1312478603,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTMxMjQ3ODYwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1312478603","actor":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-10-26T17:41:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},

But IMHO we should either offer this functionality as a ready-to-go template for the external versioner and mention it generously in the documentation and maybe in the UI, or actually integrate it into syncthings staggered versioning concept.\r\n\r\nWhy do I consider this important? I think this use case is more common than one might think. I do have rather large repos and sync-setups (several servers, 1-3TB repos each). But this is mainly because 15-20 people are actively using this to share their pictures, music, movies and documents. And most of them have asked me in the last two years how they can restore this big folder they accidentally deleted, or all the *.mp3 files they intended to rename but deleted and so on. And they weren't too happy when I told them they'd have to rename hundreds of files. \r\n\r\nSo even I had to write the same renaming script three times before I spent the time to dig deep enough to discover the possibilities of the external versioner. But I'm sure there are more non-techy users of Syncthing suffering from this than people who aren't afraid to write their own versioning script.\r\n\r\nMaybe this would be worthy of discussion in the forum?
