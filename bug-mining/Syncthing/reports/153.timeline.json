That'll run it with the old HTML+bootstrap.

using @calmh’s `STGUIASSETS` trick, I’ve narrowed the problem down to the `/gui/vendor/bootstrap` change. When I use 0.10.11’s `/gui/vendor/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css` file, the modal background covers the modal, but if I delete it using the developer tools, I can then check the boxes. When I use 0.10.11’s `/gui/vendor/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js`, the modal background problem disappears, and the boxes are still checkable.\n\nETA: changing only the Javascript doesn’t fix the problem, so seems like the CSS is the problem. Hmm\n\nDon’t know where to go from there, there are a lot of differences between those files. Seems like something changed in the new Bootstrap version, but I can’t find any known issues, and the non-device check boxes are working fine for me.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/67508252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"backspace","id":43280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace","html_url":"https://github.com/backspace","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":209655872,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA5NjU1ODcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/209655872","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-12-18T16:05:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":209655873,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwOTY1NTg3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/209655873","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-12-18T16:05:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/67512602","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1121#issuecomment-67512602","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1121","id":67512602,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NTEyNjAy","user":{"login":"backspace","id":43280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace","html_url":"https://github.com/backspace","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/backspace/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-18T16:29:09Z","updated_at":"2014-12-18T16:29:09Z","body":"Further

Bootstrap's\ngrid system appears work around the issue. Devices/folders have to be\nexplicitly split out into rows, otherwise the final element appears offset.\n\nTo do this grouping by row, a new filter (groupFilter) has been added, which\nturns an input of e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] with a groupSize of 3 into\n[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]. However altering the collection in this way throws\nAngular into an infinite watch loop, terminating in infdig. m59peacemaker's\npmkr.filterStabilize (MIT) was added to work around this issue.\n\nThis also has the side-effect of wrapping the list of devices/folders\nwhen the screen width decreases.\n\nSee also:\n- #2027 (bootstrap update which triggered this issue)\n- #1121 (last time it happened)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2030/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":348058985,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM0ODA1ODk4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/348058985","actor":{"login":"canton7","id":568104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODEwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7","html_url":"https://github.com/canton7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d24a7dd3cd68c36259752f89c741dcbcc49bdd61","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canton7/syncthing/commits/d24a7dd3cd68c36259752f89c741dcbcc49bdd61","created_at":"2015-07-05T16:20:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":348059252,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM0ODA1OTI1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/348059252","actor":{"login":"canton7","id":568104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODEwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7","html_url":"https://github.com/canton7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7023d3ca2bd605894f9fd3f1825cfd0a4d358d20","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canton7/syncthing/commits/7023d3ca2bd605894f9fd3f1825cfd0a4d358d20","created_at":"2015-07-05T16:21:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1127519670,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExMjc1MTk2NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1127519670","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-16T21:10:32Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"c2e0c6"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
