This way most cases like a single lockfile beeing open don't even show up on the users radar.\r\n\r\nMost users will only have a very small number of files (if any) which could trigger such a warning, like lock files of backup or editing programs. If we did build the \"big solution\" with the ignore list, the majority of all users wouldn't have to do anything, while some might have to click ignore a handful of times.\r\nWhich is a rather low barrier and not very deterrent from a user experience view.\r\n\r\nBut if even one user loses important data because of this, they'll most likely blame syncthing for it and discourage others from using it. Which is not just bad for the reputation, but a sign that it failed to do something the user expected of it.\r\n\r\nI've been using syncthing since the very beginning with dozens of devices and several TB of synced files (not mine, managing a friends&family cluster). So I do know all the common fallacies, but I still spent more time on this than I'd like to admit until I noticed that hundreds of files in one of the subsubdirectories were missing on one machine. The easiest way on linux to find out are rsync or using diff on an sshfs-mounted directory. I'd assume that windows users don't have it that easy.\r\n\r\nI do realize there are more difficult cases like a file beeing written to or held open by another program, but most of those cases shouldn't be too difficult to identify and ignore. Not doing something the user expects and which touches the core functionality seems like something we should try to improve.  Especially because we are throwing warnings and notifications for so many other

Thus cases like replacing a dir with a file can still be detected and handled, while the case described here wont result in data loss.</strike>  \r\nAnother possibility would be to implement #4480 and skip the current lstat tests on paths that failed to be scanned.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4573/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1468425897,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MTQ2ODQyNTg5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1468425897","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-11T13:27:12Z","milestone":{"title":"Unplanned (Contributions Welcome)"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/393622857","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4480#issuecomment-393622857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4480","id":393622857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzYyMjg1Nw==","user":{"login":"NiceGuyIT","id":7763429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NjM0Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7763429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiceGuyIT","html_url":"https://github.com/NiceGuyIT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiceGuyIT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiceGuyIT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiceGuyIT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiceGuyIT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiceGuyIT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiceGuyIT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiceGuyIT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiceGuyIT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiceGuyIT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-31T18:07:18Z","updated_at":"2018-05-31T18:07:18Z","body":"+1 for notifications of files that could not be read.\r\n\r\nUse case: [Why do .zip files from Mac OS show up as green/encrypted?](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/asklar/2012/05/03/why-do-zip-files-from-mac-os-show-up-as-greenencrypted/)\r\n\r\nWhen a Windows user unzips a file created by a Mac user, the encryption flag is inadvertently set preventing other users (like Syncthing) from reading it. Syncthing is run as a service on the file server and silently ignoring files that can't be read means Syncthing failed to do it's primary job: sync files between two servers.

Purpose\r\n\r\nAs the discussed in #4480 there is currently a discrepancy between syncing errors, which are displayed in the UI, and scanning errors, which are silently dropped. In this PR I do not change how scanning works (e.g. no additional scans due to errors), but I do track errors that do occur and make them visible through folder summary (number) and a rest endpoint like `folder/pullerrors` for the actual errors.\r\n\r\nAs tracking these errors is clearly the folder's responsibility, I needed to move the scan code from `Model` to `folder`. In my opinion that's anyway where it belongs. I did not attempt to actually remove the overlap between `Model` and `folder` - not accessing `f.model` all over the folder code is a task for another day.\r\n\r\nDiscussion point:  \r\nI added a new folder state \"Scan Failed\" which takes effect if the folder is not out of sync, but had failures on scan. Alternatively in this state the folder could just stay up-to-date or also use the out of sync state. Staying up to date would be the status quo, and make sense as in it is not know, whether the file we couldn't scan changed, i.e. we are up to date from a cluster perspective. Setting it to out of sync just means we count items we can't scan as out of sync, until we can and know for sure whether it is changed or not.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nManual\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![screenshot_2018-09-21_11-06-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15955093/45872143-8be7d700-bd8f-11e8-8ee4-f7a2db471c9c.png)\r\n![screenshot_2018-09-21_11-06-52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15955093/45872144-8c806d80-bd8f-11e8-84c6-51c2810f0adb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nNew rest endpoint to be documented","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5215/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/427874049","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4480#issuecomment-427874049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4480","id":427874049,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzg3NDA0OQ==","user":{"login":"bjornfor","id":133602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzYwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjornfor","html_url":"https://github.com/bjornfor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjornfor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjornfor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjornfor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjornfor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjornfor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjornfor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjornfor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjornfor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjornfor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-08T15:15:40Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T15:15:40Z","body":"Simple improvement suggestion: Please increase the severity of the debug(!) log message that says syncthing cannot open files due to permissinon errors.\r\n\r\n(I just spent some time debugging why syncthing didn't sync and eventually learned about the STTRACE=scanner environment variable.
