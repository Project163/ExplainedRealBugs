(I encountered this while trying to delete quite a large tree, with lots of ignored .git dirs). I think graceful detection of the situation so as not to trigger slightly unclear errors, and not pause the puller, is the most important thing. After that, a message saying \"we tried to delete this folder but there was an ignored file/folder in it so we couldn't. Please remove it yourself\" in the gui would be nice, and adding a button to delete the folder anyway would be ideal (although a fair bit more work I'm sure).
