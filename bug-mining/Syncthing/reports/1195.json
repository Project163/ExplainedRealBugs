Some API requests do folder I/O, such as /rest/db/status which tries to load the ignore patterns.\r\n\r\n(This specific case is easy to solve, because it doesn't need to load ignore patterns, it can be satisfied with whatever is already loaded instead. I'll file a PR to improve that shortly.)\r\n\r\nHowever the slightly larger issue is that the realCase can be quite slow (it does potentially lots of listdir calls) and having everything pass through a mutex that waits for that is not great. It means for example that CheckPath() that we call all over the place gets blocked by requests. Possibly we could make the cache better by using two phase locking (first a read lock which is fast and concurrent if the cache matches, then a write lock only if we have a cache miss).\r\n\r\nFor that to work we'd need to slightly re-engineer it as the cache today covers the whole path down to the leaf, and only one such path at a time (though with all parents' info). This means that if we look up `/foo/bar/baz/quux` and then afterwards `/foo/bar/baz/asdf` this is a cache miss. In practice we should probably cache the initial .../quux call and when we get the next call we follow the cache all the way down to the leaf and there just use the cached directory info in the parent instead of updating the leaf... This might make more sense looking at the code. It's not entirely trivial.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7270/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
