was happily using syncthing-linux-386-v0.8.7 and then the other end of my connection upgraded to syncthing-linux-386-v0.9.4 which stopped my updates. I then updated to that too, still nothing. We then both upgraded to syncthing-linux-386-v0.9.5 and I now only get updates to files by restarting my syncthing with ctrl-C and relaunch (reboots via UI may work too, didn't try)\n\nCaused by new settings being wrong/corrupt? Caused by what? 0.8.7 worked flawlessly for months once we got it working at all. Issues with \"no updates\" only started with upgrade to 0.9.4+ but may be present in intermediate versions too.\n\nThis could be a duplicate, I didn't check 54 other issues to find out.
