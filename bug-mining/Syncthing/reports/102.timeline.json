installed v0.10.4+4-gd305752 from your link on the two PCs. I have tested uploading from PC A the original data I used and also a new folder containing 3 sub-folders, each containing a 1GB file.\n\nTest 1. If during initial sync, I just rename the test data folder once on A (i.e. 'CAREER' -> 'career'), eveything runs fine and the issue appears fixed.\n\nTest 2. If during initial sync, I rename the test data folder name multiple times and also rename the contents multiple times, it can cause a Web GUI notice on PC B: `15:20:27: Folder \"default\" isn't making progress - check logs for possible root cause. Pausing puller for 1m0s.` But after waiting one minute, syncthing corrects itself and gets everything in sync on both PCs.\n\nTherefore, the bug appears mostly fixed with this commit. It might be nice to improve the result in Test 2, but you might consider that more an improvement than a bug.

that appears to be what happens.
