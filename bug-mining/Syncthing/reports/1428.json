I hadn't updated syncthing in a while and I started seeing a panic in my logs after doing a system update. The panic seems to happen after syncthing finishes scanning all my folders.\r\n\r\nI am unfortunately not sure how to reproduce the problem at this time. The earliest error log is of version `1.27.2`. Perhaps something to do with the file that syncthing didn't have read permissions on? I attached the logs with personal info removed.\r\n[panic-20240126-012105.reported.log](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/files/14058310/panic-20240126-012105.reported.log)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9369/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
