At one (r1) of them I changed the path to the repo to a not existing one, expecting that syncthing will create the folder (done.) and sync all the files from the other repo (r2) to my new fresh folder. But syncthing did it the other way round. All the files on the other repo (r2) were deleted (pull: delete).\n\nWhy did this happen? I do not think this is the expected / wanted behavior. How does syncthing decide if a file has to be deleted on r2 instead of synced to r1? How could I change the directory of a repo on a machine and do an \"initial sync\" without having to take care of deleting all files on other repos?\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/549/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/549/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
