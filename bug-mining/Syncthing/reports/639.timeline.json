I think this might even have been the intention at some point. If the device name is left blank in the config, it will show whatever the other side calls themselves (while connected) and not adopt it into the config. It's just that when initially accepting a connection it is set to the value announced by the other side, and then kept that way as it's non-blank. This could be improved.\n\n> Was this even thought of before adding a socks5 proxy addition, this seems to entirely collapse most security models and yet its just marching on?\n\nNo I don't think we considered this at all in relation to socks proxies. I don't think we considered proxies a part of the security model either. I'll say this though - if your security model depends on keeping this information secret and it's important to you, it doesn't hurt for you to actually test things before deploying in the wild.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/303030765/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/303030893","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4164#issuecomment-303030893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4164","id":303030893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMzAzMDg5Mw==","user":{"login":"scienmind","id":11633330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjMzMzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11633330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scienmind","html_url":"https://github.com/scienmind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scienmind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scienmind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scienmind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scienmind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scienmind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scienmind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scienmind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scienmind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scienmind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-22T08:15:46Z","updated_at":"2017-05-22T08:15:46Z","body":"> Openly advertising a unique system users platform name is pretty taboo...\r\n\r\nThat's not true, while it may not be the perfect practice, it's certainly not \"taboo\".
