Purpose\r\n\r\nThis change fixes #3241 by using the Angular framework's sanitize module to convert URLs in notice messages to HTML links.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nNo new tests have been added. Reproducing this issue and validating it has been fixed was done through manual testing. My steps were:\r\n\r\n1. Launch syncthing.\r\n2. Add ~/config/syncthing to the list of folders I want synchronized\r\n3. Validate the reference to [Syncthing Configuration files]( https://docs.syncthing.net/users/config.html#syncing-configuration-files) is displayed as an HTML link and takes the user to the proper page in a new tab.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![new_notice_message](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2366492/20466487/70225caa-af42-11e6-9033-8cfdba86b8ad.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nNo documentation changes necessary.\r\n\r\n### Authorship\r\n\r\nI'd like to be listed as Kevin White, Jr. with my GitHub username in parentheses if it's not too much trouble. Otherwise, just use my username.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3747/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":866102877,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50ODY2MTAyODc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/866102877","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"0d55d8c5b080505d706635ecb2a20ffaedc2808d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/0d55d8c5b080505d706635ecb2a20ffaedc2808d","created_at":"2016-11-21T08:27:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1353523504,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEzNTM1MjM1MDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1353523504","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-22T08:00:17Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1353523509,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTM1MzUyMzUwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1353523509","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-22T08:00:17Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
