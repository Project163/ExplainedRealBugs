both dangerous and not, as the folder wont propagate the changes the data isn't lost in the cluster, but it will delete everything locally and have to redownload once the indexes are back in.\n\nThe problem here is that what you describe is correct: As no other device is announcing these files, they are local changes - that's the definition of them. And I don't see how syncthing should know that it's just a temporary thing and remotes will announce those files. We could do something like if the folder is shared with at least one device, and we have no indexes from them, wait for indexes to come in and don't consider things changed until the, but the question is \"when are we done\"? At any point, missing indexes could be files that no remote has or files remotes haven't announced yet. You can come up with heuristics, like delay marking things as locally changed until X time passed after the last received index update, but that will break down in many scenarios (too frequent changes, weird connection issues, ...).\n\nSo to me this is working as designed as in not a bug, and in the absence of a concrete improvement suggestion I'd also close it as a feature request as it's not actionable.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/3009111110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/3009214792","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10191#issuecomment-3009214792","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10191","id":3009214792,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAOCAEs6zXPlI","user":{"login":"tomasz1986","id":5626656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjY2NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5626656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasz1986","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-26T17:24:02Z","updated_at":"2025-06-26T17:28:23Z","body":"I was thinking of maybe disabling the button while indexes are being downloaded.

Maybe it's still allowed intentionally to queue the operation afterwards? I have my doubt that's very valuable either, also mostly confuses users if they click a button and then nothing happens for a long time.

show revert buttons only when folder is idle (fixes #10191)\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Revert Local Changes button for Receive Only folders, and\r\nthe Delete Unexpected Items button for Receive Encrypted folders buttons\r\nare shown even when the folder is already performing other operations.\r\nBecause of the above, pressing the button seems to have no effect, as\r\nits operation can only proceed after the previous operations have\r\ncompleted. This confuses the user, who then may keep trying to press the\r\nbuttons again and again with no visible result.\r\n\r\nTherefore, show the two buttons only when the folders are actually idle,\r\nwithout performing other operations at the same time. This change makes\r\nthem behave similarly to the Override Changes button, which is also only\r\ndisplayed for Send Only folders when they are idle.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Tomasz Wilczyński
