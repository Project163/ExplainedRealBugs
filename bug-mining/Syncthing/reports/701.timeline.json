does not prevent the inconsistent state discussed in #4475, as it would require lots of db lookups for a relatively rare situation. It instead detects this situation when a directory should be deleted due to pulling/remote change, but there exists known valid files inside this directory. In this case the version of the local dir is bumped such that overrides the deletion from the other device.\r\n\r\nThis change broke one test and I added one more to target this specific scenario. This lead to feature creep in connected code:\r\n - The broken test `TestIssue3164` does nothing in the model, it operates solely on the sendreceive folder, so I fixed and moved it in rwfolder_test.go.\r\n - s/f.dbUpdates/dbUpdateChan/ because all other channel involved in pulling are not part of the folder struct and are anyways redefined on every puller iteration.\r\n - Don't call `ScanFolder` in goroutines on every puller iteration, add paths to `toBeScanned` and \"schedule\" the scan at the end of pulling (actual scan will anyways only happen after pulling finished). Saves some redundant scans and seems less hackish to me.\r\n\r\nTesting: One new test simulating #4475, which in addition also tests the case of an unexpected, unscanned file in a to be deleted folder. No \"testing in production\" so far, I will do that when I examine the invalid PR situation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4493/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4493/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1333088004,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEzMzMwODgwMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1333088004","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"637a1a8f1f582d7507f474170a526ab9db5f0c78","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imsodin/syncthing/commits/637a1a8f1f582d7507f474170a526ab9db5f0c78","created_at":"2017-11-09T01:26:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1346654735,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDEzNDY2NTQ3MzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1346654735","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-17T08:00:48Z","milestone":{"title":"Planned"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1346654871,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQxMzQ2NjU0ODcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1346654871","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-17T08:00:54Z","assignee":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed
