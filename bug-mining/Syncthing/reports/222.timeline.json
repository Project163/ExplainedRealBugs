got a folder that I want to sync which got about 300 000 files, from these about 250 000 are small files, about 80KB, but there are also some large files, that have about 2GB each.\n\nWhen I start syncthing it get stuck for about an hour, just to compute which all files are not synced, and to build that huge queue of files to sync. And then it get stuck again, after syncing few small files on one huge file that needs about a day or more for it to be synced, because it's huge.\n\nIf there was an option to sort the sync queue by size, it would get rid of all small files in few hours and whole thing would start working much more smooth, as there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of files in the queue, which makes syncthing very laggy and unresponsive, thus whole sync process would be incredibly more fast and effective.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/86715884","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1434#issuecomment-86715884","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1434","id":86715884,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2NzE1ODg0","user":{"login":"N-Coder","id":1306276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDYyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1306276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder","html_url":"https://github.com/N-Coder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-26T21:02:44Z","updated_at":"2015-03-26T21:02:44Z","body":"I think a bidirectional Publish/Subscribe system via [WebSockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) would be better suited here (it is the successor of BOSH, Comet, long polling, etc.). The Website/GUI could connect to the Syncthing API via WebSocket and subscribe to all the \"channels\" that should be updated regularly (as noted in syncthing/syncthing-gtk#66: /rest/system, errors, connections and events) and the server would then send updated data as soon as it changes (or at regular intervals, if changes can't easily be detected, e.g. for the CPU usage in /system). All other requests (mainly POST requests and GETs for data that rarely changes) would still be made via normal HTTP/REST.\nThis would remove the problem of AJAX requests piling up when the server is too slow to respond, and usually leads to data being updated faster (as it is immediately pushed from the server and not pulled by the clients in regular intervals) at the very low cost of the server managing a stable WebSocket connection per client. As WebSocket is one of the main features of HTML5, it is broadly supported by modern browsers and has various server implementations.\nI would really like to help you implementing such improvement, as it would probably solve the problem mentioned in issue #867 (which also affects my syncthing setup). I could help with the design of such an API and the implementation of WebSocket Server and Client, if you want to see such feature implemented. Unfortunately I'm new to the go language and don't know anything about the internals of you API (but I'm also keen on learning more about it ;) ).\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/86715884/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"N-Coder","id":1306276,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDYyNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1306276?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder","html_url":"https://github.com/N-Coder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/N-Coder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/86878181","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1434#issuecomment-86878181","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1434","id":86878181,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2ODc4MTgx","user":{"login":"canton7","id":568104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODEwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7","html_url":"https://github.com/canton7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-27T09:18:26Z","updated_at":"2015-03-27T09:18:26Z","body":"@N-Coder I think what you're proposing can be broken down into two separate (but related) issues:\n1. We already have a long-polled events interface, where lots async data appears, without it having to be polled for. Putting stuff that's currently being polled for (model updates, errors, etc) onto the events interface would significantly reduce the amount of polling. This is (as I understand it) what @calmh's referenced commit does.\n2. The events interface doesn't have to be long-polled: using websockets would be another option here, and one that might be worth considering. However do bear in mind that the majority of Syncthing's REST API clients _aren't_ web browsers. We've got cli interfaces, custom GIUs, tray icons, you name it, interacting with Syncthing in this way. A long-polled interface is easy to write a client for: a websockets interface is tricky if you don't have a library

Having a desktop app act as a websockets client is hardly a common thing to do.\n\n> While current polling method requires maintaining timer and doing TCP connections ever few seconds (actually pretty crazy thing to do).\n\nThe _long polling_ requires a thread, a loop, and a new connection about once a minute in the idle case.
