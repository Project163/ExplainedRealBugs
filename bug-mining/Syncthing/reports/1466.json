I replace the password by something simple to avoid problems with special chars, but even `test123` resulted in the same issue.\r\n\r\nI'm sure it worked before and I didn't change anything. I definitely had the correct password.\r\nAfter getting this error, I've reset the password multiple times, updated to the latest version 1.29 (old was 1.27 I think). Nothing helped fix the problem.\r\n\r\nMy guess: Maybe something changed regarding encryption/decryption of the password (Windows update) causing a bug?\r\n\r\nNote: I set `debugging` attribute to `true` in the <gui/> tag in config. Is there is anything else I can do to generate (more) log lines and help debug this issue?\n\n### Syncthing version\n\nv1.29.0 \"Gold Grasshopper\" (go1.23.4 windows-amd64) builder@github.syncthing.net 2024-12-30 03:46:20 UTC\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Browser version\n\nChrome 131.0.6778.205 \n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n[KAVAC] 2025/01/09 18:43:09 INFO: Wrong credentials supplied during API authorization from 127.0.0.1:50860\r\n[KAVAC] 2025/01/09 18:43:13 INFO: Wrong credentials supplied during API authorization from 127.0.0.1:50860\r\n[KAVAC] 2025/01/09 18:43:26 INFO: Wrong credentials supplied during API authorization from 127.0.0.1:50860\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9909/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9909/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
