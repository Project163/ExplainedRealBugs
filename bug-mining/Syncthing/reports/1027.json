This limits Syncthing's peak RAM usage when there are many connected devices all requesting file data. The default is 256 MiB.\r\n\r\n- The config option maxConcurrentScans has been removed and replaced a new config option maxFolderConcurrency. In addition to just limiting concurrent scans it now also limits concurrent sync operations. The default is the number of available CPU threads (\"GOMAXPROCS\").\r\n\r\n- Syncthing now always runs the monitor process, which previously was disabled with -no-restart. This facilitates crash reporting and makes logging behave more consistently. The observed behavior with -no-restart should be the same as before but the internals differ.\r\n\r\n- The database schema has been improved and will result in a migration plus compaction at first startup after the upgrade.\r\n","creator":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":53,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-16T06:48:10Z","updated_at":"2020-03-17T06:20:59Z","due_on":"2020-03-17T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-03-17T06:20:59Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2019-07-28T08:07:09Z","updated_at":"2021-01-24T07:02:39Z","closed_at":"2020-01-24T07:35:49Z","author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"The database becomes quite large in large setups and this reduces performance, due to writes and compaction. Currently we keep a copy of each file info for each peer. This is simple but wasteful, especially for the block list. There are attributes we need to remember per device (the invalid bits, for example) but it should be enough to keep one copy of the block list, keyed by folder/file name/version.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5898/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5898/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
