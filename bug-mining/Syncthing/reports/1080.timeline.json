I ran into this very thing except in my case, I was moving files on \"A\", then the disk holding \"B\" failed (the syncthing config on both hosts was still intact.) So, I removed the folder on B's syncthing and readded it (B now contained partial contents restored), and the results can only be described as pandemonium... after an initial bit of resyncing, moving a file on B would sometimes result in the file instantly being deleted or moved to \"sync-conflict\", presumably because A's history last saw that file in that state. Thinking about it, it is hard to figure out what exactly *should* happen in cases like this, but \"WTF\" behavior is probably not the best.

noticed something unexpected when I remove a shared folder from a device (let's call it A): soon, all my other devices that share the same folder try to push it again to A, as if A never had that folder in the first place. The only way to stop them sending notifications is to go to each device's UI and un-select A from the list of devices sharing the folder.\r\n\r\nI believe this behaviour is troublesome and counter-intuitive: to stop one device from sharing that folder, I also need to tweak all the other devices. A non-expert user could get very confused and not know how to fix the issue at all. What I would expect is for device A to tell the others: \"I had that folder, I don't want it anymore, stop sharing it with me\".\r\nTechnically, I'd say that upon deletion, A should remember the devices that were sharing the folder at that time, and try to notify each of them of the deletion. When a device is actually notified, A can forget about him having the folder. When all the devices are notified, A can finally forget about the folder altogether.\r\n\r\nI experienced this with device A being an android smartphone, with syncthing-android v0.9.6 (latest on f-droid) and syncthing v0.14.22-rc.1+12-g5a1ee7c. Other devices are laptops and ARM devices with auto-update enabled (currently using syncthing v0.14.23).\r\n\r\nI did some searching before posting, but I didn't find any reference of what should happen in this case, either confirming or disproving my experience.

Two new flags can also be used to affect the location of the configuration (`-config`) and database (`-data`) separately. The old `-home` flag is equivalent to setting both of these to the same directory. When no flags are given the following logic is used to determine the data location:\r\n\r\n- If a database exists in the old default location, that location is still used. This means existing installations are not affected by this change.\r\n- If `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set, use `$XDG_DATA_HOME/syncthing`.\r\n- If `~/.local/share/syncthing` exists, use that location.\r\n- Use the old default location.\r\n\r\nThis logic is used on non-Windows, non-Mac platforms only.

clearly is \"data\" and the XDG spec says to put \"user-specific data files\" there.\r\n\r\nWhy? indexdb can grow large and people can consider to put them on a specific partition for example or
