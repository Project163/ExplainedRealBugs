Verify that both S3 and Azure blob storage implementations work correctly\n* Check that the removal of 'hidden:\"true\"' attribute doesn't expose credentials in logs or UI\n* Review the log level change from Warnln to Debugf to ensure it won't miss important

PR Summary\n\nRefactor Storage Implementation: Add Azure Blob Support and Abstract Storage Interface\n\n## Overview\n\nThis PR refactors the storage implementation by replacing concrete S3-specific code with a generic blob storage interface and adds support for Azure Blob Storage as an alternative storage backend.\n\n## Change Types\n\n| Type         | Description                            |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Feature      | Add Azure Blob Storage support         |\n| Refactor     | Replace concrete S3 implementation with generic blob storage interface |\n| Security     | Security credentials for S3 and Azure now exposed in help text and docs |\n| Enhancement  | Improved function parameters and context handling |\n\n---\n\n## Affected Modules\n\n| Module / File                     | Change Description                       |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| `infra/ursrv/serve/serve.go`     | Refactored imports, added blob interface, exposed credentials |\n| `stdiscosrv/database.go`         | Replaced concrete S3 implementation with blob interface |\n| `stdiscosrv/main.go`             | Added Azure Blob storage configuration options |\n| `stdiscosrv/apisrv_test.go`      | Updated function parameters in tests |\n| `api/tokenmanager.go`            | Enhanced login attempt tracking |\n| `config/optionsconfiguration.go` | Changed logging level and format |\n| `osutil/net.go`                  | Added strings package import |\n| `copyrights.go`                  | New file to update copyright notices |\n\n---\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n* Security credentials for S3 and Azure blob storage are now exposed by removing the 'hidden:\"true\"' attribute\n* Storage implementation interface has changed, requiring updates to any code using the concrete S3 types directly\n\n---\n\n## Notes for Reviewers\n\n* Verify that the blob storage abstraction properly handles both S3 and Azure implementations\n* Security review needed for the removal of hidden:\"true\" from credential fields\n* Check for any performance implications of the abstraction layer\n\n---\n\n## Additional Context\n\n* This PR enables Azure Blob Storage as an alternative to AWS S3 for backend storage\n* The storage refactoring improves modularity and allows for additional providers in the future","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codeOwlAI/syncthing/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/codeOwlAI/syncthing/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
