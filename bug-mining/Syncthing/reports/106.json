It was nice too see there was a way to extract the ignore information from the Syncthing app.\n\nCurrently the /rest/ignores API looks as follows:\n\n```\nGET /rest/ignores\n\nTakes one parameter, folder, and returns either the content of the .stignore , or an error.\n\n$ curl -s http://localhost:8080/rest/ignores?folder=default | json_pp\n{\n   \"ignore\" : [\n      \"Thumbs.db\",\n      \"#include anotherfile\",\n      \"\",\n      \"// Comment\",\n      \"somefile\"\n   ]\n}\n```\n\nUnfortunately this does not provide a lot of functionality for clients (besides GUIs): it just reads the .stignore file. Other ignored files such as `.stversions`, `.stfolder` and `.syncthing.*` are missing. Keeping an up to date list with upstream is error prone (i.e. when `.stfolder` was added all clients would need to be informed to update their code).\nAdditionally, the ``#include` functionality requires clients to read out files. This is also redundant functionality that Syncthing already implements.\n\nI propose to add an extra `/rest/ignores2` API in one of the following ways:\n1) return a complete list of items to be ignored (including .st\\* files and #include arguments, without comments)\n2) Same as 1) but with _all_ ignore patterns translated to regular expressions. Could this include negated ignores? Maybe a remark can be added such that the client should only be executed on the same OS as Syncthing is running (to reduce confusion of slash and blackslash).\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/942/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
