Not sure when, as I'm currently traveling with family, but I do have a laptop in reach.\n\nRegardless of which option we choose, the fact that FolderCompletion is not resent for folders added in the last ClusterConfig is a bug in itself. Fixing that will help here as well if we stay with the current event.

Purpose\r\n\r\nAs discussed in #8266, this replaces the `accepted` boolean in `FolderCompletion` with a string derived from the recorded `remoteFolderState` value.  A new event type `RemoteClusterConfigReceived` causes the folder summary to be sent again shortly after learning the remote updates.\r\n\r\nThe new event doesn't have any meaningful content yet, I'd welcome suggestions on how to handle that.  Skipping in case the remote folder states haven't changed would be easy though, if we want that.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nAccepting or unsharing a folder on a remote device is reflected in the GUI within a few seconds now.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/syncthing/docs/pull/736 needs to be adapted for this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8283/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6442077797,"node_id":"COE_lADOAOCAEs5HhKeCzwAAAAF_-k5l","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/6442077797","actor":{"login":"acolomb","id":6996887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTY4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6996887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb","html_url":"https://github.com/acolomb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-15T20:00:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6475951830,"node_id":"CE_lADOAOCAEs5HhKeCzwAAAAGB_y7W","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/6475951830","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-22T06:42:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
