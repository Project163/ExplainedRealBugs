A magic number that indicates that this is a Syncthing/BEP connection\n2. A \"Hello\" message that contains some basic metadata about the other side (client name and version, etc).\n\nWe should make sure to handle incompatibilities here and display a message that is as friendly and informative as possible.\n\nIn particular we should keep track of current and historical magic numbers. This should only change in case the protocol changes in it's entirety, but we know that's going to happen at least once more. Hence we should be able to say not only \"incorrect magic\" but \"The device xyz is using protocol version blah which is not compatible with this release - please upgrade\".\n\nIf it seems feasible we might also isolate and keep around the code to parse hello messages for old versions. Again this will be less of an issue in the future, but we know one big break is coming. Being able to say with precision that \"The device called jb-laptop is running Syncthing v0.13.47 which is too old for this Syncthing v0.14.2\" is better than just \"some device is too old\".\n\n\"Planned\" as this needs to go into v0.13, and sooner rather than later.\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
