Folder is paused is not an error IMHO.\r\n\r\n - any steps to reproduce the problem.\r\nWell.... it happes from time to time, not on every try. \r\nPress the PAUSE button from a folder. Maybe some more often as usual. \r\nI'm sorry, it just happens when I don't think about it, so I cannot tell you how to click that button :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v1.4.1\r\nOS Version: MacOSX Sierra\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5833/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
