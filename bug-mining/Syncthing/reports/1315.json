With normal folder types I would understand, but watching for changes seems pointless for \"Receive Encrypted\" folders as there shouldn't be any changes happening on that device.\r\n\r\nI think it would be great if \"Watch for changes\" were automatically disabled on \"Receive Encrypted\" folders as it would save memory on the device as no local changes should be happening on those folder and if there are they can be caught by periodic scanning.\r\n\r\nAlso I might be missing something about \"Watch for changes\" and why it might still be useful for \"Receive Encrypted\" folders.","closed_by":{"login":"acolomb","id":6996887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTY4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6996887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb","html_url":"https://github.com/acolomb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
