Implementation proposal of the discussed enhancement in #8244\r\n\r\nIn short:\r\nDepending on the connection type we add an icon before the device-status in the Remote Device panel. This should make it easier to notice if/when we use an inferior connection-type (f.e. Relay).\r\n\r\nOne can argue about what connection types deserve an 'own' icon, but also considering the amount of icons that are available in the same style from a default library (without needing to tweak them ourselves) I simply agreed with the latest comments from the issue, so from \"worst\" to \"best\":\r\n\r\n1 - Relay\r\n2 - QUIC\r\n3 - TCP WAN\r\n4 - TCP LAN\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-09-23 at 14 36 33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43787840/191961637-b26c909d-6786-40dd-81f9-5cb126f0eb64.png)\r\n\r\nThe icons used are default reception icons from the bootstrap library (1-4 respectively). This icon-library was added.\r\n\r\nThe tooltip has been made somewhat interactive to add a direct link to the relevant document-page and sub-part. To accomplish this I added a delay of 1000ms before the tooltip disappears, this should give some time to click on the '?'-icon. Other than linking to the docs, this tooltip gives a brief description in a style of \"Connection type: [type]\" where ~~\"Connection type\" is translatable, whereas the types currently aren't (apart from 'Relay', not sure whether it can be properly translated actually - I'm open to input). Reason being that the other connection types are, afaik, internationally known abbreviations.~~ both parts are translatable. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTesting it is quite simple. Add some remote devices, preferable with different connection types.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nAn example of how it now looks:\r\n![Screenshot 2022-09-23 at 13 57 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43787840/191960308-1274675f-bb8b-45a9-8157-08161503c73c.png)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nI will adjust the documentation when the implementation is approved.\r\n\r\nThis can quite simply be a brief explanation of what these icons mean, what they don't mean and a visualisation of the four possible states (icons) with a short description of the meaning of each of them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8553/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8553/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7448733990,"node_id":"COE_lADOAOCAEs5Gwwm9zwAAAAG7-qkm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/7448733990","actor":{"login":"acolomb","id":6996887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTY4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6996887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb","html_url":"https://github.com/acolomb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-23T16:25:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
