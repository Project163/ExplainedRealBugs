Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v1.3.1\r\nOS Version: multiple, Linux 32bit, Android 64bit\r\nBrowser Version: (if applicable, for GUI issues)\r\n\r\nStarting with v1.3.1 the API endpoint /stats/device returns an empty JSON object.\r\n\r\nThis leads to the UI showing \"Never\" as the \"Last connected\" time.\r\n\r\nI'm seeing this on three of my devices already updated, user \"yeti\" in IRC has confirmed that this is happening for him/her too.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n1. connect two syncthing instances running v1.3.1\r\n2. stop one instance\r\n3. check the UI or API on the other
