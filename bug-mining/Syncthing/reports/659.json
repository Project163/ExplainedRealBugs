Triggers sync to machine B.\r\n\r\nMachine B overwrites file X without warning since it hasn't discovered it via a scan yet.\r\nI've tested this between a few different OSes in different directions.\r\nOther observations:\r\n- Modifying existing files on both sides before a single rescan appears to work correctly.\r\n- Deleting the test files then rescanning/recreating on both sides/rescanning appears to generate the expected conflict file.\r\n\r\nIt is slightly contrived I know, but it is more likely when using longer rescan intervals to conserve battery / IOPS. There is no safety net if multiple machines create a file with the same name within a rescan interval.","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3742/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
