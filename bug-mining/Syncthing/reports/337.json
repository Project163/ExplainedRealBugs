I am wondering if this is down to boot2docker.\n\nI have managed to `./build.sh docker-init`.\n\nHowever, `./build.sh docker-test` returns\n\n``` bash\n+ mkdir -p /go/src/github.com/syncthing\n+ cd /go/src/github.com/syncthing\n+ cp -r /tmp/syncthing syncthing\ncp: cannot access `/tmp/syncthing/cmd/syncthing/testdata': Permission denied\ncp: cannot open `/tmp/syncthing/internal/model/testdata/.stignore' for reading: Permission denied\n```\n\nI rewrote a docker file for pulse, which gets around this when it is kept at the root of the project.\nSomething a bit like the following. It uses the official golang container images for the cross compilers.\n\n```\nFROM golang:1.3.3-cross\n\nADD . /go/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing\nWORKDIR /go/src/github.com/syncthing/syncthing\n\nRUN go get github.com/tools/godep\n\nENTRYPOINT [\"./build.sh\"]\n```\n\nHowever, this approach just hangs until a SIGQUIT is fired because integration tests take too long. \n\nAny thoughts? Has/Where has anyone else managed to get integration tests working?\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1030/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
