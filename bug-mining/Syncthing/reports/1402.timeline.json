set up the Syncthing web GUI to require username and password to open it. Syncthing Tray handles it quite well, but if I want to log in to the web GUI from by browser I'll quickly find myself troubled.\r\n\r\nWhat I expect to happen?\r\n1. I enter localhost:8384\r\n2. A login page appears, so I can use the Bitwarden plugin in my browser to automatically fill in the credentials, or at least to be able to copy the username and password from the plugin's window and paste them manually.\r\n3. I successfully enter the web GUI\r\n\r\nWhat happens?\r\n1. I enter localhost:8384\r\n2. A new window opens requesting for credentials, which blocks the whole browser UI, so I can't open any plugin's window\r\n3. I click cancel, and close the tab\r\n4. Copy the credentials from the Bitwarden plugin to notepad\r\n5. Re-enter localhost:8384\r\n6. Paste the credentials from notepad\r\n7. I successfully enter the web GUI\r\n\r\nThis is even more boring since Syncthing Tray wants to open the web GUI on every single reboot for some reason.
