use Syncthing on Manjaro and Windows machines and the core works really good. However, the GUI could be more efficient when reporting the percent of sharing between two machines. Currently, it calculates the percent regarding to the number of files transfered but it should do that based on the size.\n\nFor example: If I share 3 files, 3go, 500mo and 100ko. If the 3go file is transfered first, the percent will show 0% until the file is fully complete.\n\nRequest: Get the size of the whole files to transfer first and calculate the progress based on what have been transfered instead of the number of files.\n\nThank you.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2842/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-10T19:03:35Z","updated_at":"2016-06-10T19:03:35Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3295","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3295/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3295/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3295/events","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3295","id":159696805,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNTk2OTY4MDU=","number":3295,"title":"Syncing

Further calculation based on just that folder in question indicates that the 20% in sync estimate is accurate for that folder.\n\nAssuming no background  whatsoever, I'd expect the 'Syncing' percentage for a device to reflect how far the remote device is from the global state directly, and it's pretty obviously not doing so.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/226838418","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1300#issuecomment-226838418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1300","id":226838418,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjgzODQxOA==","user":{"login":"Ferroin","id":905151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/905151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin","html_url":"https://github.com/Ferroin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-17T17:59:06Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T17:59:06Z","body":"I'm kind of curious why this has been left untouched.

Purpose\n\nWhen 2 or more folders are shared with a remote device, the completion displayed in the device section on the right was based on a simple average of the completion of the shared folders. This is irrelevant when the folders have different sizes (e.g. a folder _X_ of 20MiB and a folder _Y_ of 100GiB; the _X_ folder will be quickly completely synchronised and bring the completion to 50%, even if just a very few part of the data has been send).\n\nI weighted this average with the global size to reflect more accurately the progress of the synchronization.\n### Testing\n\nI have created two folders on an instance _A_ with very different sizes (1MiB and 2.3GiB). After asking to synchronised thooses two folders with an other device _B_, I checked regularly the percentage displayed on _A_ next-to the name of the device _B_.\n### Authorship\n\nThis is my first contribution to syncthing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":750381255,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NzUwMzgxMjU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/750381255","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"c9cf01e0b6f80d4579a7a50c64339df91f0b1e4e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/c9cf01e0b6f80d4579a7a50c64339df91f0b1e4e","created_at":"2016-08-09T19:58:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1200077850,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEyMDAwNzc4NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1200077850","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-08-10T00:13:17Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1200077853,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTIwMDA3Nzg1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1200077853","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-08-10T00:13:17Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
