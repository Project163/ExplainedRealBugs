This will allow us to change the domain name and IP address of our own STUN server without having to patch Syncthing.\n\nThis should be enough to fend off most non-Syncthing users.\n\nIf there's a consensus that this is a viable approach, I'd start working on a PR.\n\n### Problem or use case\n\nAs previously discussed on the forum, we may still want to host our own STUN server. The problem with such a service is that it tends to be abused by others, which ultimately led to the current server being shut down. Any hardcoded address in the codebase is likely to suffer the same fate sooner or later.\n\nsee https://forum.syncthing.net/t/stun-syncthing-net-doesnt-resolve-anymore/24075/8\n\n### Alternatives or workarounds\n\nStatic secrets for the STUN server, but this could suffer the same fate. Anything that can simply be hardcoded into a WebRTC page will eventually be abused. DNS SRV requires backend logic, which should deter more offenders.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10029/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
