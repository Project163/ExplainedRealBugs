As a result Syncthing cannot sync data on SD Card except one folder /sdcard1/Android/data/com.nutomic.syncthingandroid/files/\n\nMy suggestion is not to stop syncing read-only folders if \"Folder Master\" option is selected.\nAn obvious example why we may need it is one-way syncing photos _from_ an Android device.\n\nIn this case file .stfolder also cannot be written and a \"permission denied\" error rises. This needs to be resolved somehow.\n\nOf course, this would be useful not only on Android platform. Generally , this is quite logical to allow one-way sync of read-only directories when \"Master Folder\" option is selected.\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
