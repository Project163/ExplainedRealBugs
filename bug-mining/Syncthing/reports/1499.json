They're all on default hourly scan. But with 20 of them it naturally adds up, so with Syncthing 2.0.x I am now getting three \"Folder changed state\" messages practically every minute (`scan-waiting` → `scanning` → `idle`) – probably 1/3rd of all system logs since reboot are just Syncthing informing verbosely about its periodic rescans. I'm wondering if these messages are really necessary, or if I'm holding Syncthing the wrong way.\n\n### Syncthing version\n\nv2.0.3\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nLinux x86_64\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nSep 04 09:07:52 myth syncthing[725]: 2025-09-04 09:07:52 INF Folder changed state (folder=ichok-zz7qs state=idle log.pkg=model)\nSep 04 09:09:38 myth syncthing[725]: 2025-09-04 09:09:38 INF Folder changed state (folder=exrmo-cczah state=scan-waiting log.pkg=model)\nSep 04 09:09:38 myth syncthing[725]: 2025-09-04 09:09:38 INF Folder changed state (folder=exrmo-cczah state=scanning log.pkg=model)\nSep 04 09:09:39 myth syncthing[725]: 2025-09-04 09:09:39 INF Folder changed state (folder=exrmo-cczah state=idle log.pkg=model)\nSep 04 09:12:19 myth syncthing[725]: 2025-09-04 09:12:19 INF Folder changed state (folder=raav2-qm2mc state=scan-waiting log.pkg=model)\nSep 04 09:12:19 myth syncthing[725]: 2025-09-04 09:12:19 INF Folder changed state (folder=raav2-qm2mc state=scanning log.pkg=model)\nSep 04 09:12:19 myth syncthing[725]: 2025-09-04 09:12:19 INF Folder changed state (folder=raav2-qm2mc state=idle log.pkg=model)\nSep 04 09:13:31 myth syncthing[725]: 2025-09-04 09:13:31 INF Folder changed state (folder=lwfnc-bdl2x state=scan-waiting log.pkg=model)\nSep 04 09:13:31 myth syncthing[725]: 2025-09-04 09:13:31 INF Folder changed state (folder=lwfnc-bdl2x state=scanning log.pkg=model)\nSep 04 09:13:31 myth syncthing[725]: 2025-09-04 09:13:31 INF Folder changed state (folder=lwfnc-bdl2x state=idle log.pkg=model)\nSep 04 09:14:26 myth syncthing[725]: 2025-09-04 09:14:26 INF Folder changed state (folder=cdnce-jrrlr state=scan-waiting log.pkg=model)\nSep 04 09:14:26 myth syncthing[725]: 2025-09-04 09:14:26 INF Folder changed state (folder=cdnce-jrrlr state=scanning log.pkg=model)\nSep 04 09:14:26 myth syncthing[725]: 2025-09-04 09:14:26 INF Folder changed state (folder=cdnce-jrrlr state=idle log.pkg=model)\n```","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10350/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
