However, what is the intention for how the user should disable relaying? By changing the `default` listen address to `tcp://0.0.0.0:22000`? That's hardly discoverable :(\n\nThe config upgrade code must also take this into account, whatever we do here, so that the existing preference is retained.\n\nTo me, it seems like the simplest and cleanest solution is to resurrect the `relaysEnabled` option, and just have `default` not mean relays in that case. In fact, I'll prepare a PR for that for discussion, and if some better idea comes up in the meantime we can do that instead.
