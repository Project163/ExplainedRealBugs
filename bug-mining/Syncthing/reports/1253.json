Then later A shares the folder to a device B, which is also trusted. B might then share the folder to U without encrypting the data. With introducers activated, that might even happen automatically.  \r\nThe outcome is, that the connection between B and U fails if U is a behaving Syncthing instance. If U is an adversary, they can receive plain data. B sharing the folder with U without encrypting data is a misconfiguration, nevertheless we should make it as hard as possible (or impossible), to do that.
