Since then, I get lots of info messages like:\n\n```\n[XYZXYZ] INFO: Puller: final: symlink  <path of symlink>: no such file or directory\n```\n\non the receiving device (Device 2). Upgrading Device 2 to 0.14.1 didn't made any difference.\n\nAll of these symlinks already existed on Device 2, but for some reason were removed from it. This seems to affect all symlinks, independently if they point to an existing source or not. Although, the symlinks were remove on Device 2, they still exist on Device 1 and the `Master` Folder is not marked as `Out of Sync`.\n### Version Information\n\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.1\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3445/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
