It works fine in version 0.10.1. Then in 0.10.2 it fails due to improper UUID (this issue discribed in #890). Versions 0.10.3 and 0.10.4 are more tolerate to UUID, but another problem arises: when syncthing sends request to router to add port mapping, the router returns error: 400 Bad Request. This results in a following error: \"WARNING: Failed to create UPnP port mapping\".\n\nI used Wireshark to get the packets sent to server: [v0.10.4](http://pastebin.com/5b2CGqev) and [v0.10.1](http://pastebin.com/bPS5MA6e)\n\nThe one part, that looks suspicious in v0.10.4:\n\n0160  70 70 69 6e 67 22 0d 0a 41 63 63 65 70 74 2d 45   pping\"..
