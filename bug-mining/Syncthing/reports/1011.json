Choose a folder that doesn't have any Ignore patterns.\r\n2. Make sure there's no existing `.stignore` file or delete it.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Syncthing GUI, and click \"Edit\" the selected folder.\r\n2. Hit \"Save\" (without changing anything).\r\n\r\n### Actual results\r\n\r\nA new, empty `.stignore` file is created.\r\n\r\n### Expected results\r\n\r\nWhen hitting \"Save\", if there are no Ignore patterns specified, Syncthing should not create a `.stignore` file, or should delete it if it already exists.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v1.3.1\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6190/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
