am sorry for the long title, but I am not sure how exactly to describe this.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create and share an empty folder between 3 devices - A, B, and C.\r\n2. Add one large file to the folder on A.\r\n3. While still syncing, pause the folder on A.\r\n4. Wait for B and C to mark the folder \"Out of Sync\".\r\n\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/107113860-0ce29300-68a5-11eb-8960-e67308241a53.png)\r\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/107113862-0eac5680-68a5-11eb-8468-bbd852b2e401.png)\r\n![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/107113864-0f44ed00-68a5-11eb-8e38-2130d11e4882.png)\r\n\r\n5. Unpause the folder on A.\r\n6. B and C are stuck trying to download the file.\r\n7. In this state, add two more large files to the folder on A.\r\n8. The two new files get properly pushed to B and C, but the first file gets \"forgotten\" in the process.\r\n\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/107113913-5d59f080-68a5-11eb-807c-199018121b28.png)\r\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/107113915-5f23b400-68a5-11eb-866b-715523336132.png)\r\n![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/107113916-60ed7780-68a5-11eb-92db-1aa864391dd3.png)\r\n\r\n9.

Purpose\r\n\r\nThis change would have prevented the db/index corruption even if the bug that caused #7649 is present. It ensures that indexes are only ever received after checking IDs, regardless of the order methods are called in model. Getting the order right in the model is hard, as it involves multiple, intertwined inputs (connections being established/closed, local config changes, remote config changes, ...).\r\n\r\nThe main change here is to move receiving indexes/writing them to the db into what is currently the `indexSender` (renamed to `indexHandler`). Checking indexIDs happens when starting/creating an index handler, thus it's now impossible to receive indexes before checking IDs.\r\n\r\nGit doesn't pick up the the rename as there's too many changed lines, however the diff is actually quite sane with one function moved verbatim. Thus I recommend looking at the diff without the first commits:  \r\nhttps://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/pull/7689/files/adfb666f486503e6f63803de3a2831adaa4fa9a9..0e7a416c77bbd80556b1646be6073e7f6c9c7152\r\n \r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nDue to the stricter conditions on receiving indexes a lot of tests now require a (fake) connection to work. Somehow that resulted in more usage of `fakeFS` and triggered a crash there, thus the lone change to lib/fs.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4776542870,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ3NzY1NDI4NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4776542870","actor":{"login":"tomasz1986","id":5626656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjY2NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5626656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasz1986","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b9ed6ea2bbb376de7214bab033ebdcf04af8cf62","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tomasz1986/syncthing/commits/b9ed6ea2bbb376de7214bab033ebdcf04af8cf62","created_at":"2021-05-21T00:05:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4790779513,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQ3OTA3Nzk1MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4790779513","actor":{"login":"st-release","id":14043830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDQzODMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14043830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release","html_url":"https://github.com/st-release","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-25T07:44:51Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.17.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4798340710,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ3OTgzNDA3MTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4798340710","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"653d5e0724f93e2c3854a8d10334bccafee21d50","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/calmh/syncthing/commits/653d5e0724f93e2c3854a8d10334bccafee21d50","created_at":"2021-05-26T10:18:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
