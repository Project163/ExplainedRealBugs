The \"avoid to raise\" thing is just that if someone already set nice level 19 we should not raise it back to 9 due to `setLowPriority=true`, for example.

a few comments on this:\r\n\r\n1. The classes you listed are how Linux implements things, I'm not sure that it's the same on other UNIX systems, and it might be good to double check for at least FreeBSD (the other BSD's should be similar enough to FreeBSD to not matter).\r\n2. IO class is by default set by the process scheduling class on pretty much all UNIX systems in existence.  For Linux for example, if you set a process's nice value to 20, it will automatically get the lowest best-effort scheduling class for I/O, set it to -19 and it will automatically get the highest best-effort class, set it to real-time scheduling, it will get a RT I/O scheduling class of appropriate proportionate value, and set to the idle CPU scheduling class and it will get the idle I/O scheduling class.\r\n3. The 'idle' scheduling classes on Linux aren't actual idle schedulers, they will still preempt other things on occasion, they just get the lowest possible scheduling priority (which is good on the CPU side, but probably bad on the I/O side for most people as it will increase the time it takes to actually sync things).\r\n4. Only some schedulers on Linux actually support I/O priorities handled this way.  Some don't support priorities at all, others only support them through control groups.  I would be very careful about how this change of priority is documented, as otherwise you will get people complaining about it having no impact on anything on distros that use such schedulers by default (which is most big distros right now
