Two new flags can also be used to affect the location of the configuration (`-config`) and database (`-data`) separately. The old `-home` flag is equivalent to setting both of these to the same directory. When no flags are given the following logic is used to determine the data location:\r\n\r\n- If a database exists in the old default location, that location is still used. This means existing installations are not affected by this change.\r\n- If `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set, use `$XDG_DATA_HOME/syncthing`.\r\n- If `~/.local/share/syncthing` exists, use that location.\r\n- Use the old default location.\r\n\r\nThis logic is used on non-Windows, non-Mac platforms only. On Windows and Mac the logic is unchanged.\r\n","creator":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":66,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-18T19:49:05Z","updated_at":"2020-05-05T06:03:45Z","due_on":"2020-05-05T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-05-05T06:03:45Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-12-14T21:08:23Z","updated_at":"2021-04-05T07:02:27Z","closed_at":"2020-04-04T09:33:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"It's nice that we now have LDAP authentication. Now that we have it, and in the spirit of taking the whole arm when offered the hand, there are a couple of improvements we could make. To make it more enterprise, though that wasn't the target of the initial implementation. ;)\r\n\r\nCurrently the mode of operation is LDAP bind by pattern. That is, the user enters \"jb\", we have a pattern \"CN=%s,OU=users,DC=kastelo,DC=net\", we combine the two and attempt a bind. This mode of operation is perfect against a small OpenLDAP where 1) every user in the system should have Syncthing access and 2) the name in the DN (CN=... above) is what the user enters. Both of these two assumptions are typically false in larger setups or in AD.\r\n\r\nA more complete implementation would (at least as an optional mode of operation) have:\r\n\r\n1) a bind user, which has permissions to search the directory\r\n2) a search pattern where we plug in the username the user entered and match it against logon name (AD terminology) or email\r\n3) a group membership restriction, which in its simplest incarnation can be coded into the user search pattern above as an `&& memberOf = ...` type of thing.\r\n4) and then do the bind against the found user, like we do today.\r\n\r\nAll in all this is about five more lines of code, excl the extra config option (I just implemented it in another product).","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5376/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5376/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
