If it was in fact on github, feel free to close this one.\n\nThere are tons of errors which would be really helpful even to non-technical users. Mostly because it gives them something they can feed google with.\n\nSome things which should be escalated to the web UI:\n- Any reason why a folder was stopped.\n- ~~Not sure if possible:  errors in programs which access syncthing via the api. For example the \"no space left on device\" error from syncthing-ionotify would be highly interesting to know about.~~\n- ~~Failure to create port mappings via UPnP (this has cost me nearly two hours, because I've been debugging the wrong side :-( )~~\n\nPlease chime in with proposals for other errors which deserve their own yellow error boxes!\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
