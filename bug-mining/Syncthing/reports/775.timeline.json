rescan interval for a folder is reset to 3600 in the GUI the first time you open a folder configuration after connecting to Syncthing with a fresh browser session (this does not seem to happen subsequently when opening a folder's configuration after the first time).\r\n\r\nSaving the configuration at this point then saves the 3600 rescan interval, overriding the previous value. \r\n\r\nObviously, I don't expect the rescan interval to revert to 3600 seconds if it was set to something else. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nHave a syncthing instance running and share a folder, and set its rescan interveral to something other than the default 3600. \r\nClose the browser (or close Synctrayzor to a notification icon).\r\nOpen a new browser session and connect to snycthing (or reopen Synctrayzor).\r\nExpand the folder details (notice the rescan interval is not the default as per your config change).\r\nOpen the folder configuration and go to the advanced tab.\r\nSee that the Rescan interval value is 3600.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.47\r\nOS Version: Windows 10 (Synctrayzor) / Debian 9\r\nBrowser Version: Snyctrayzor 1.1.21 / Firefox
