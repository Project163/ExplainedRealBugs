If you define your filetype using the extension (like .jpg), it's a bad design because it can fail. The „right“ way to create a file type based compression would be to look into the files header (first few bytes) and then decide, if it should be compressed or not. Of course it still needs a global setting for file types it doesn't know.\n\nAnd don't forget, that txt-files are usually just a few kB in size, so the benefit (on average) is minimal (well, except you've got gigabytes of logfiles).\n\nA compromise could be, that Syncthing only checks if it's a textfile or a binary file and enables compression if it's a textfile and disables it in every other case (But an extra setting would still be necessary: disable compression, enable compression and auto compression)\n\nI know the Block Exchange Protocol handles the compression of messages through a one bit flag, does anybody know if this is also the case for the user data? If yes, this could be a problem.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/75865745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"KopfKrieg","id":5047813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNDc4MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5047813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KopfKrieg","html_url":"https://github.com/KopfKrieg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KopfKrieg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KopfKrieg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KopfKrieg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KopfKrieg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KopfKrieg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KopfKrieg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KopfKrieg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KopfKrieg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KopfKrieg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/75867461","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1374#issuecomment-75867461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1374","id":75867461,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1ODY3NDYx","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-24T23:02:47Z","updated_at":"2015-02-24T23:02:47Z","body":"Well
