If I understood correctly, this commit broke it a few years ago: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/commit/f0f60ba2e74737f16c9fac5e9447d1835fa3deb5#r128163305\r\n\r\nSo, currently what happens is that the hashed password is taken as the literal plain-text password and hashed. That is, the hash becomes my password.\r\n\r\nIs there supposed to be any way of providing hashed GUI passwords to the syncthing API?\r\n\r\nSyncthing version 1.24.0 on NixOS.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9123/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
