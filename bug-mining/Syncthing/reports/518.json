Nowadays the versioning is much more advanced than just an integer, and the local version isn't really a \"version\" in any real sense of the word.\n\nIt is however a sequence number that is incremented on every change, and lets devices know where in the sequence to resume index sending and so on. So renaming it to that would make more sense to me.\n\n``` diff\n--- a/lib/protocol/bep.proto\n+++ b/lib/protocol/bep.proto\n@@ -68,7 +68,7 @@ message Device {\n     repeated string addresses    = 3;\n     Compression     compression  = 4;\n     string          cert_name    = 5;\n-    int64           max_local_version = 6;\n+    int64           max_sequence = 6;\n     bool            introducer   = 7;\n     uint64          index_id     = 8 [(gogoproto.customname) = \"IndexID\", (gogoproto.customtype) = \"IndexID\", (gogoproto.nullable) = false];\n }\n@@ -102,7 +102,7 @@ message FileInfo {\n     bool         invalid        = 7;\n     bool         no_permissions = 8;\n     Vector       version        = 9 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];\n-    int64        local_version  = 10;\n+    int64        sequence       = 10;\n\n     repeated BlockInfo Blocks = 16 [(gogoproto.nullable) = false];\n }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3461/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
