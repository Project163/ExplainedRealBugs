Oftentimes they are a result from erring on some Syncthing share algebra, but the fact that it's happened twice in the past couple months could be cause for concern. In those instances, a popup warning that lets us know something along the lines of \"Continuing with what you are doing could result in an infinite directory loop!\" would have been really nice to keep us from making a that terrible mistake.\n\nIf you can't pull the directory structure at share creation, then maybe while it's starting its initial sync, run some pattern recognition that kills the sync process for the affected shares? This might help a lot since not all of my people are very technically inclined. Just a thought. Thanks!\n\nSyncthing Version: v0.13.0\nOS Version: Windows 7,10\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3197/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
