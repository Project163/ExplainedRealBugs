`-gui-address` command-line parameter no longer accepts a scheme in v0.12, complains of \"too many colons\".\n\nSee IRC log:\n\n```\n<canton7> it seems that v0.12 doesn't like having 'http://' or 'https://' in the -gui-address command-line parameter?\n<calmh> okay\n<canton7> is that an intended change, or an (unintended?) artefact of something else?\n<calmh> too many colons etc\n<canton7> yeah\n<calmh> i think unintended\n<calmh> i don't remember doing something about it intentionally\n<calmh> but i do remember changing how we handle overrides of those things from the command line\n<calmh> so i probably broke something\n<canton7> it would make my life amazing again if I can force https, even if the user hasn't checked that box in the settings (otherwise I'm playing a bit of a redirection guessing game) :D\n<calmh> you can always use https anyway, you won't get a redirect to http from it\n<calmh> but yes, that's supposed to work\n<canton7> I vaguely recall there being a gotcha there, but can't remember what it was\n<canton7> (helpful I know..)\n<calmh> right\n<calmh> so if that option is given, we just pretend that was the value that was stored as listen port in the config\n<calmh> but we don't store it that way in the config, and we have a separate tls flag there\n<calmh> so that's broken\n<calmh> we shoudl chop off the scheme, like we did before\n<calmh> i changed the config handling for other reasons a few commits back and broke this then\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2371/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
