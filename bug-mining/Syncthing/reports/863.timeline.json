Such as protobuf files used in `go generate`. For example, instead of the current \"protoc -I ../../vendor/...etc\" we need something like a wrapper script that figures out where the module actually lives on disk and points protoc to that:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat script/protoc.go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n\t\"bytes\"\r\n\t\"fmt\"\r\n\t\"os\"\r\n\t\"os/exec\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tvar args []string\r\n\tif p :=
