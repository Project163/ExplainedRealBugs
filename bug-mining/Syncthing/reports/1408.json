has the ability to handle certificates passed by traefik proxy server in `X-Forwarded-Tls-Client-Cert` header.\r\n\r\nPreviously, traefik url encodes the content but it stopped doing so since version v2.9.4.\r\nThis becomes troublesome for setups where stdiscosrv sits behind newer traefik versions,\r\nas now stdiscosrv tries to url [decode](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/main/cmd/stdiscosrv/apisrv.go#L356) the header content when it is not encoded.\r\n\r\nThe symptom can be very confusing, as if some client's certificate's pem text happens to not contain `+`, etc, then it works perfectly, but other clients will always fail announcement with 403 error.\r\n\r\nMore details can be found at https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues/9669.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what should be the best strategy here to support both old and new traefik versions... but wanted to at least raise attention.\r\n\r\nstdiscosrv version: 1.24.0\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9143/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
