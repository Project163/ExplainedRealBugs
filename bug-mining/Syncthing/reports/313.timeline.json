topic, since the files are all in the same folder, and named by YouTube ID. Possible solutions:\n1. Separate the video files into separate folders within the torrent file. Problem: many videos are in multiple topics, so there would be duplication.\n2. Separate torrents for different subtopics. Problem: same as in 1, plus fragmentation of the seeder space.\n3. Be able to select within the KA Lite Update interface which videos to download (as we currently support), but have them get downloaded via BitTorrent instead of from the S3 servers.

it?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/77684654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"krozycki","id":4281416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODE0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4281416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki","html_url":"https://github.com/krozycki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":247973139,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyNDc5NzMxMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/247973139","actor":{"login":"krozycki","id":4281416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODE0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4281416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki","html_url":"https://github.com/krozycki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-07T11:11:28Z","assignee":{"login":"krozycki","id":4281416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODE0MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4281416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki","html_url":"https://github.com/krozycki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krozycki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/77685188","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1157#issuecomment-77685188","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1157","id":77685188,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3Njg1MTg4","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-07T11:22:55Z","updated_at":"2015-03-07T11:22:55Z","body":"So I think this will be fairly hard.\nmodel.Request gets called from the protocol package.\n\nThe reason this is hard:\n1. We cannot pass a socket handle into the model, because we need to send packet headers before the actual request content, which means we need to know the size of the data before we write it (since it's one of the fields).\n\nPossible options:\n1. Instead of expecting a []byte, err return value from .Request, we could pass a []byte into request which it then copies the data into.\nThe []byte would be allocated by sync.Pool in the protocol package, knowing when it can be reused.\nNot sure if you can make go read a file into a []byte though.\n2. Have some sort of clever writer wrapper which internally uses sync.Pool beween different instances and knows how output the exact set of bytes to the socket once it has all the relevant fields set.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/77685188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/77690852","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1157#issuecomment-77690852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1157","id":77690852,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NjkwODUy","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-07T14:15:49Z","updated_at":"2015-03-07T14:16:04Z","body":"In my experience, one issue with using sync.Pools for buffers is that it's a long way from where we allocate to where we can reuse, and it's not always clear when exactly we are done with a buffer (some slices of it may live on as hashes etc). When I tried earlier it was less efficient than what we're doing now. But! There were also bugs with sync.Pool in go 1.3 so that objects in the pool weren't freed as they were supposed to when GC kicked in, and sync.Pool has caused massive improvements in other places I've used them, so I think it's probably worth it to take another
