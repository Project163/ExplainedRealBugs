looks like my initial analysis was wrong (sorry about that) and I ran into two things:\r\n\r\n1. Extended attribute syncing does not work properly in the following scenario: L1 talks to L2 only, L2 talks to L1 and M1, M1 talks to L2 and M2, M2 talks to M1 only (L = Linux, M = Mac)\r\n2. A chmod permission error preventing xattrs from being applied\r\n\r\nSo obviously the latter is user error 🤦🏻.\r\n\r\nBut in 1), I'm not sure how many clients are required, but that's the setup I have currently. I believe it was only L1 <-> L2 <-> M1 when I first ran into the issue and started digging (and then creating the second issue in the process).\r\n\r\nSo let's say I do the following:\r\n1. M1: `touch test.txt`\r\n2. L2: `setfattr -n user.test -v test test.txt`\r\n3. L1: `setfattr -n user.test2 -v test2 test.txt`\r\n\r\nThen `user.test` is never propagated to `L1` and `user.test2` is never propagated to `L2`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly creating a file on L2 breaks xattrs between M1/M2.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1272382790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mafredri","id":147409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri","html_url":"https://github.com/mafredri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1272384017","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8594#issuecomment-1272384017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8594","id":1272384017,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAOCAEs5L1woR","user":{"login":"mafredri","id":147409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri","html_url":"https://github.com/mafredri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mafredri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-08T19:32:56Z","updated_at":"2022-10-08T19:32:56Z","body":"Hmm, that's weird.

I thought I was clever when I crafted the comparisons for xattrs and ownership, in that we only consider a file info different if it's set on both sides -- otherwise a file would be unequal and require resync as soon as it's synced to a new operating system and new attributes picked up. But precisely that actually needs to happen, otherwise we don't send out the change when a file comes from linux and we add attributes on macos, and things like that. We need to pick up those attributes and send back the changed file. There are details in making that happen properly that I'll hopefully be able to deal with, PR upcoming at some point tomorrowish...\r\n\r\nOne potentially interesting side effect is a cluster with two sendOwnership or sendXattrs devices won't work.
