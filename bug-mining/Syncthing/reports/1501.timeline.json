The format is `<%d>` (without any space separator), the integer value being the same levels as in syslog:\n\n    <7>  debug\n    <6>  info (default)\n    <5>  notice\n    <4>  warning\n    <3>  error\n    <2>  critical\n    <1>  alert\n    <0>  emerg\n\nIIRC, current systemd versions interpret this prefix for all services' stdout logs without having to enable anything. Previously it was a `SyslogLevelPrefix=` option. For testing `systemd-cat` also does the same.\n\nThough `--log-systemd` might cause confusion with the _actual_ systemd structured logging API, but I'm not sure of a better name, maybe `--log-level-prefix`.\n\n(I'm not relaly familiar with how logging is done at scale – on my own home server I just have a basic hand-made setup where anything `>= error` in the system log gets emailed to me daily and `>= alert` goes to a Discord push notification. So for example I get notified about some service OOM-crashing, based solely on the message levels, without specifically needing to parse any message contents.)","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/3252576834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"grawity","id":31021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grawity","html_url":"https://github.com/grawity","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grawity/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grawity/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grawity/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grawity/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grawity/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grawity/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grawity/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grawity/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grawity/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19499406372,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs7JmoV2zwAAAASKQVQk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/19499406372","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6cfcf7dd158487fc8b5b5bce2e18bb0314ddea4b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/calmh/syncthing/commits/6cfcf7dd158487fc8b5b5bce2e18bb0314ddea4b","created_at":"2025-09-04T09:07:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19522820587,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs7JmoV2zwAAAASLppnr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/19522820587","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"546b832694e7590ea681ef7332369610eba047e6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/calmh/syncthing/commits/546b832694e7590ea681ef7332369610eba047e6","created_at":"2025-09-05T06:43:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19522889929,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs7JmoV2zwAAAASLp6jJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/19522889929","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cbc3af486730862c9256915155246db714a8e7f7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/calmh/synct
