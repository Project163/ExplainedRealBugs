Prior to v0.9, the effect would have been (given your scenario above) that `testfile.txt` was deleted on B when it was ignored on A (because it \"disappeared\" from A:s point of view). Currently, `.stignore` only means that we don't see the file locally any more so no more changes will be picked up, but we'll still see changes from other nodes and try to sync to it.

might be another issue: What happens (should happen) if on another node, a file is created with the same name as a file that I'm ignoring locally:\n1. Overwrite the local file: The user is now unhappy because (s)he needed that local file.\n2. Do not sync: The user is unhappy, because (s)he forgot that `.stignore` on the server and expected that the files would now be backed up there.\n3.

This seems inconsistent.\n\nThere probably isn't a default correct behaviour for `.stignore` that will make everybody happy.\nMaybe the \"button in the GUI\" option is the way to go. When an ignored file should be changed a conflict is shown (to the node having the problematic .stignore) with the following options to resolve:\n1. Accept change: will apply changes from global repo (maybe creating a backup of the original file)\n   - Additional Checkbox: Do not ignore this file anymore: Will create a negative entry in the `.stignore` (not sure if this is possible yet).\n2. Ignore change once: will dismiss the conflict and keep everything as it is\n3. Always ignore change: Will not show the conflict for this file again (and change none of the files)\n\nSo in my case which I described in my first comment, I would go for option 2 after deleting the files on the other node.\n\nThe only consistent behaviour I can think of is ignoring all incoming and outgoing changes of anything listed in `.stignore`.

am running syncthing version v0.11.17, Linux (64 bit) on Archlinux straigt from the repository, updated 5 seconds ago.\n\nWe are using syncthing to syncronize project files across multiple ~10 computers and 2 servers.\nTo ignore temporary files a file called stignore is included in the directory. We encourage symlinking that to .stignore, but it is quite likely that some users did not do that.\n\nProblem: when opening the SyncthingWebGui or using syncthing-gtk a red Out of Sync is displayed next to our project folder. Looking at the details shows that all Out of Sync items should be ignored by the .stignore. Additionally there is an Entry called Failed items, which does not contain any further information but just  \"...\" instead.\n\nWhile this does not really influence our workflow, it is visually distracting and makes people unsure if they are synced or not.\n\nThis issue might be related to https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/561\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/210499851","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/561#issuecomment-210499851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/561","id":210499851,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDQ5OTg1MQ==","user":{"login":"daviddelikat","id":91501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat","html_url":"https://github.com/daviddelikat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-15T15:12:26Z","updated_at":"2016-04-15T15:12:26Z","body":"I think the best solution would include tracking the items that this client ignores, likely just filename and size.  I prefer a simple total ignorance feature where this instance ignores any file local or remote which matches the patterns in .stignore.  Perhaps syncthing needs to have an 'alarm protocol' where it creates status files near files that are causing issues.  For instance a file called junk.doc could cause junk.doc.ST_status when there is an issue...  the file would contain some diagnostic info.  the user can see that there is a problem and deal with it.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/210499851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"daviddelikat","id":91501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat","html_url":"https://github.com/daviddelikat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daviddelikat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1127684352,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExMjc2ODQzNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1127684352","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-17T00:13:53Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1127684353,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTEyNzY4NDM1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1127684353","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-17T00:13:53Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
