Domain names/hostnames resolving to localhost such as 'localhost' are not considered local.\r\n\r\n>  https://forum.syncthing.net/t/security-warning/13843/8, calmh said:\r\n\r\n> Prior to 1.3.0 the warning was just based on the config value, even if overridden externally. In 1.3.0 it’s based on the config or the overridden value but the logic is unchanged. The logic never accounted for names like “localhost”.\r\n**What we should do is just get the address from the GUI listener, so we get in IP form whatever it actually ended up listening to.**\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v1.3.0\r\n\r\nPS: I'm not really happy with the issue title, if somebody has a better wording please change.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6049/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
