That seems unlikely to me.\n\nMy old Android phone had some power issues and reset'ed about once every two weeks. This problem appeared, I'm also able to reliable reproduce it by disconnecting the battery.\nIf I open the synced files and call fsync on them the problem does not appear.\nI was using an SD card as adopted storage and the Syncthing database was in the internal storage. Maybe Android syncs one storage more often than the other.\n\n> it requires opening and syncing the directory after rename\n\nYes, besides fsync'ing the temporary file itself before renaming.\n\n> behaves differently on windows\n\nI don't think that Windows supports syncing of metadata.\n\nMacOS also behaves differently: fsync doesn't ensure that the on-disk-cache is flushed. It has the operation F_FULLFSYNC for that.\n\n> Also, performance hit.\n\nIf a lot of small files get synced in a short period of time that's certainly true. To mitigate this problem you could collect finished files and commit them in bulk.\n\nI would be more than happy with a environment variable, that causes AtomicWriter to call fsync on the temporary file and the directory (and enables durability for leveldb). That would only add a few lines of code and the user can enable it on problematic
