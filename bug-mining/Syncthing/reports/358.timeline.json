new to this and not a computer expert. I've been trying Syncthing with 3 folders between my laptop and home computer re getting more organised and love the Syncthing concept.\n\nHome desktop XP pro SP3 32bit - laptop Asus window10 basic, 64bit. Just downloaded Syncthing and operate it via web browser (the intention is to extend to remote use when I'm competent!)\n\nEverything working fine for over a month then yesturday the desktop Syncthing starts crashing! with \"divide by Zero\" panic - exit status 2 - restart Syncthing. This carries on randomly for about 20minutes before Syncthing shuts down.\n\nI've copied the \"syncthing.log\" & \"panicXXX.log\" below (found them in \"Application Data\" folder\n\nCan anyone help a non-computer geek?\n\nKind regards\nchrisp\n\n[TZ2RH] 12:00:52 INFO: syncthing v0.12.0-beta3 \"Beryllium Bedbug\" (go1.4.2 windows-386 default) unknown-user@syncthing-builder 2015-10-12 05:18:53
