have a very similar use case where I'm syncing windows and linux machines, and (1) permissions should be ignored, but (2) the umask should be respected on the linux systems (files should be group-writeable, i.e. umask 0002).\n\nAnyway, I've had a look at the syncthing code, and I've identified the main parts of the code that are involved.  As a matter of fact, syncthing currently _does_ respect umask settings.  Any golang system call to create new files or directories will respect the umask on unix-like systems.  The actual problem is that new files are created with 0644 permissions and directories with 0755.  If you set 'ignore permissions' on a share, these default permissions are not altered anymore after the initial file creation.  Since the umask by definition only takes away permissions, the group-write bit will therefore never be set.\n\nI've managed to compile a syncthing version that produces the correct behavior (at least for my current setup) by setting default permissions to 0666 and 0777 for new files and directories, respectively.  The unix umask then automatically takes care of taking away the inappropriate permission bits (i.e. making the files and directories not world-writeable etc).  If you want, I can share this commit? (Still need to do some cleaning up.)  So far I've only tested this on windows and linux (arch) on shares where the permissions are ignored.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/103053964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mogwa1","id":4405330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDUzMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4405330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1","html_url":"https://github.com/mogwa1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/103059712","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1339#issuecomment-103059712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1339","id":103059712,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzA1OTcxMg==","user":{"login":"dr4Ke","id":128122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODEyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/128122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr4Ke","html_url":"https://github.com/dr4Ke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr4Ke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr4Ke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr4Ke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr4Ke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr4Ke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr4Ke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr4Ke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr4Ke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dr4Ke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-18T13:27:54Z","updated_at":"2015-05-18T13:27:54Z","body":"Cool.

When I tested my original fix with servers having different combinations of ignorePermisions, I ran into problems.  I've got it fixed now; or at least for the combinations of OSes and ignorePermissions settings that I tried.\n\nI'm by no means an expert on the syncthing code (or Go as a matter of fact), but I think the problem is a bug in the current ignorePermissions implementation.  \n- According to https://forum.syncthing.net/t/v0-8-10-ignore-permissions/263/3, the ignorePermissions flag should only be picked up on the server where the new file is created.  If ignorePermissions is set on that server, the FlagNoPermBits is added to the flags.\n- On the receiving side, the file flags should be checked for FlagNoPermBits.  If this bit is set, the default permissions for that OS should be used.\n\nHowever, what is happening in the code (at least to my limited knowledge) is:\n- The FlagNoPermBits is set correctly on the server where the new file is created.\n- On the receiving end, the ignorePermissions setting (belonging to the share) is used instead of checking whether the FlagNoPermBits are set on the files which are being received.\n- This will give the same results as the intended behaviour except when you have a mixture of ignorePermissions settings on the servers.  In that case, you will get very unpredictable permission settings.\n\nI will do 2 pull requests, if that is ok:\n- one to fix this (probable?) ignorePermisions/FlagNoPermBits bug; (I will also open a bug report)\n- another one directly related to this issue, where the permissions of newly created files are changed such that the umask is respected on systems that support it.\n\nNote, however, that the two pull requests are needed to completely close/fix this issue.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/105071565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mogwa1","id":4405330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDUzMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4405330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1","html_url":"https://github.com/mogwa1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"mogwa1","id":4405330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDUzMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4405330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1","html_url":"https://github.com/mogwa1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mogwa1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-24T22:22:24Z","updated_at":"2015-05-24T22:22:24Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1868","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1868/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1868/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1868/events","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/pull/1868","id":80289640,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzYxMDkzOTQ=","number":1868,"title":"Change
