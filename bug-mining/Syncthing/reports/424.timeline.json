They are great if you have a lot of people sharing similar directory structures (documents, pictures, videos, music...).\nBut they should very much be optional, or worked around because the current implementation makes it hassle-free for one person to set up a group of devices. This is generally the go-to route for any family or group of friends with one designated \"IT guy\".\n\nAlso copying dozens of folder IDs into a file (in addition to device IDs) if you want to set things up on several devices is a huge pain. Asking the recipient of a share if he wants to accept \"XK8SB-KLJASD\" from \"paul-computer\" is similarily horrible UX wise.\n\nI think the easiest way would be to map device IDs to the existing folder IDs and locally store the mapping. In this case duplicate folder IDs aren't a technical problem, but have to be presented in a user friendly way. For example by forcing the use of labels for all newly added folders with a duplicate ID and coloring the folder IDs or their background.\nThe mapping, coloring scheme and probably labels should also be synced across authorized devices.\nThis caters well to how people communicate, because they may be unfamiliar with the differences between labels and folder IDs.\n\nShares with duplicate IDs could then have a little \"details\" button next to the id which opens a list with the corresponding labels and devices. \n\nFor the folder labeled \"Music\" on the local machin this could look like this:\n\nFolder ID: shared-music\nAlso known as:\nmusica @ santiago_cell\nmusica @ santiago_computer\nMusik @ maximilian_computer\nmusique partagée @ angelina_laptop\n\nOn a technical level mixing globally unique, group unique and locally unique IDs is certainly possible but a nightmare to merge into a user friendly interface.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/63297977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"generalmanager","id":6797943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTc5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6797943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager","html_url":"https://github.com/generalmanager","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/63313883","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/966#issuecomment-63313883","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/966","id":63313883,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMzEzODgz","user":{"login":"menelic","id":5934115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzQxMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5934115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/menelic","html_url":"https://github.com/menelic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menelic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menelic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menelic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menelic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menelic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menelic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menelic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menelic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/menelic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-17T14:43:04Z","updated_at":"2014-11-17T14:43:04Z","body":"I would like to respectfully request that this be added to the v1 milestone, if possible,  for all of the above reasons: Sharing folders with similar names (my and my family members \"Pictures\" folders) is a common usecase...which is poised to get a lot more common once pulse drives ind.ie's heartbeat.
