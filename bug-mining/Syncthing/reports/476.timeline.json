with cache busting, we'd still have to force the index page to either always be revalidated, or not cached at all, so I don't think we're gaining anything by using cache busting: just use the same strategy for the assets as for the index page.\n\nAside: note that we're a bit different your typical website, in that we can't afford any delay in expiring old assets (think about switching themes, or upgrading, where the first request after the theme switch / upgrade determines whether or not the user thinks Syncthing is broken); however we fetch everything from localhost (almost all of the time, anyway), and we've got an SPA which loads all of its assets only once, so revalidating or fetching the entire asset is cheap anyway.\n\nTherefore my personal preference is either to add the `noCacheMiddleware` to all requests (simple nuclear option, with few consequences in practice), or keep the `Last-Modified` approach but try and force browsers to always revalidate.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/221799392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"canton7","id":568104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODEwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7","html_url":"https://github.com/canton7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"canton7","id":568104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODEwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7","html_url":"https://github.com/canton7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/canton7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-27T19:18:01Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T19:18:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canton7/SyncTrayzor/issues/262","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canton7/SyncTrayzor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canton7/SyncTrayzor/issues/262/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canton7/SyncTrayzor/issues/262/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canton7/SyncTrayzor/issues/262/events","html_url":"https://github.com/canton7/SyncTrayzor/issues/262","id":155573355,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNTU1NzMzNTU=","number":262,"title":"SyncTrayzor
