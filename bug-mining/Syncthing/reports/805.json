use `suture.Service`s in a lot of places and I like the interface, and that we get restarts on error returns etc. I'm not fond of the fact that it transparently swallows panics.\r\n\r\nFor example, a `panic(\"bug: foo\")` in the database layer that we expect should be loud and fatal currently goes silently unnoticed if it's called from a folder runner, as that is a suture.Service and it just gets automatically restarted. Apart from the obvious issues, this leaves us with deadlocks if the panic happened inside a lock that wasn't defer-unlocked. \r\n\r\nI suggest we add a `PanicsPanic` options to the package, and see if we can get it accepted upstream. If not, I can live with a fork (it's a very stable package, seldom updated).","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4758/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
