am not actually certain it fixes #5332 for lack of reproducer, but it's likely the cause: When a file cannot be pulled, it isn't removed from the queue and readded on the next try. And the queue is never reset, so that stays there \"forever\" (as long as the folder is constantly running). I fixed that instance and added `jobQueue.Reset` that removes everything from queue that's invoked when the iteration is finished - in case the folder is stopped (or I missed something else).
