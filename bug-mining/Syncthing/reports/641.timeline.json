Those were my PR's from a while back.  Also my memory is a bit fuzzy on all this but here goes:\n\nIIRC, I also originally wanted to put the shortID in the filename but was having a problem carrying it from one class to the other (think it was from model class to fileversion or versionvector or something like that)\n\nWhat I DID end up doing however was putting in code that would (if -audit flag was enabled) cause each client to write down if an add/change/delete to a file was because of it's own local scan of the hard drive OR if it came from another device.  My thoughts then were that we could eventually take all these messages (that are currently written to the audit log of each client) and correlate them into a central synced db so we could know who made the original change of a file.  That part never got added but it should be easier to do with the base code in there.\n\nThe commit I'm describing is this I think: https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/commit/86ca58e2a96c01d1d67435602443c35b050ee322\n\nSo basically... Look for the LocalDiskUpdated event in the audit.log when you change a file (make sure to restart with -audit flag).  The behavior SHOULD be that only the client(s) that change the file on their own hard drive between scans, fire that event, and the ones that receive the file from network do not add that event to their audit log.  Therefor the client with the audit log that has this event is the guilty one.\n\nThis should be enough info for someone to write code to announce who the last client to make the change was.  Maybe even add it to version vector and/or GUI... or something?\n\n--- EDIT ---\nLooks like the line in the audit log has \"LocalChangeDetected\" in it, from my tests.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/242241809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nrm21","id":15898046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODk4MDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15898046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21","html_url":"https://github.com/nrm21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/242248304","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3524#issuecomment-242248304","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3524","id":242248304,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjI0ODMwNA==","user":{"login":"nrm21","id":15898046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODk4MDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15898046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21","html_url":"https://github.com/nrm21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nrm21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-25T00:24:24Z","updated_at":"2016-08-25T00:28:35Z","body":"AudriusButkevicius wrote (in response to where file came from):\n\n> I actually think it''s impossible in some cases, as we don't track where the file originated from\n\nThat's correct from what I found in my pouring through this problem a few months ago.
