It looks like Firefox prefers the last favicon that is found in `<head>` which is the link to `favicon-{{syncthingStatus()}}.png`. Because that file is not available on initial page load, it is not considered for bookmarks. The favicon logic for Firefox can be found [here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c09764753ea40725eb50decad2c51edecbd33308/browser/modules/FaviconLoader.sys.mjs#443).\r\nSwitching the order of the favicon links in `<head>` fixes the behavior for Firefox while breaking the dynamic favicon for Chromium-based browsers.\r\nA proper fix for this issue was suggested by @ajshea in https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7638#issuecomment-838888561.\n\n### Syncthing version\n\nv1.27.6\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nLinux x86\n\n### Browser version\n\nFirefox 124.0.2\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9506/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9506/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
