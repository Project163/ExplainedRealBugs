one thing that isn't addressed: What will we call it? We kind of delayed this before. Given \"watch\" is already in the config names and it is actually descriptive (it watches out for changed files), I think we should keep that. In the UI we could add/focus on \"change\" instead of \"FS\" as it is probably easier to grasp what it does to the user.\r\n\r\nPermissions are picked up by all platforms except mac. It may be possible to do there too, but the native event names aren't conclusive and I didn't dive deeper into it. I don't know about mtime only changes. In any case having no rescan intervals at all isn't a good idea in general, as watcher relies on various different backends which may have deficiencies (and for some of those, I heard that they do).\r\n\r\nA fallback seems like a good idea. It might be problematic for cases where the fallback (e.g. 60s) is way too short, e.g. on a low-resourced device where this could clog up the machine. Maybe just a warning on the folder suffices.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible that it is \"half-running\", we have no way to detect it. Watches are a fire-and-forget type of service.\r\n\r\nI think it is a good idea to somehow combine the status indication for interval scanning and watching, as both are about the same thing. It could be renamed to just \"Scanning\" with possible values like \"interval 60s\", \"watching & interval 60min\", just \"watching\" when interval is 0.\r\n\r\nIf we do the automatic switching of rescan interval when checking the watcher checkbox, then the checkbox must be above the rescan interval. Otherwise it is very annoying if the interval is reset after you set the interval to the desired value and then toggle the watcher.\r\n\r\nAnother nice thing to have in the UI: Indicated when the watcher isn't supported. If javascript can detect the underlying OS, this can be hardcoded there, otherwise it could be new REST endpoint which gives this information (by setting a random watch and checking for the unsupported error).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/347050073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/347050712","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4552#issuecomment-347050712","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4552","id":347050712,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzA1MDcxMg==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T00:13:31Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T00:13:31Z","body":"Is there am OS where it's not supported?
