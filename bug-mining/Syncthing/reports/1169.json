Does your log mention database corruption?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Include required information\r\n\r\nSyncThing version: 1.10.0\r\nOS: macOS 10.14.6\r\nBrowser version: Safari 14.0

10.14.6), trying to add a new shared folder, which is residing on my Studio Network Solutions EVO NAS (mounted via SMB).\r\n\r\nEvery time I click “Save” on the “Add Folder” window, I get [this “operation not supported” error](https://d.pr/i/YI1PTF), apparently when ST tries to save the .stignore file.\r\n\r\nWhen I have the folder opened in Finder, I see the .stignore file being created, but then it immediately gets deleted, momentarily replaced by an “.smbdeleteXXXXX” file, then it disappears altogether.\r\n\r\nThe “.stfolder” folder does get created in the shared folder, though, but it remains empty after clicking “Save”\r\n\r\nI tried manually touch'ing the .stignore file first via Terminal, then tried to add the Shared folder again, but I still get the error in ST.
