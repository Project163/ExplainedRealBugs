I guess in my case it's because of the windows source and different permissions management between OS, but it can also be easily replicated from linux:\n\n``` bash\n# Create RW dir\nmkdir test\n# Dummy file inside\ntouch test/a\n# Dir as read-only\nchmod a-w test\n```\n\nDirectory 'test' is synced, in read-only mode, and second node is not able anymore to create the a file inside:\nOct 23 23:38:42 arch-linux syncthing[5669]: [L3SXL] 23:38:42 INFO: Puller (folder \"default\", file \"test/a\"): dst create: open /xxx/test/.syncthing.a\nOct 23 23:38:42 arch-linux syncthing[5669]: [L3SXL] 23:38:42 WARNING: Folder \"default\" isn't making progress - check logs for possible root cause.

Doing it manually on the target node works for the first time, until syncthing changes it back to read-only (in case of slave mode).\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/904/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
