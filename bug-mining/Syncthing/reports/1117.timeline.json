The `mv` is one thing, but what if you have `MyFile` and then create `myfile` on Linux?\n\nI think the most sane approach would be to treat the two files as different, as on Linux, and considering clashes on Mac (and other case-insensitive platforms) as a limitation that needs to be worked around.\n\nTreating the filenames as identical would probably just be a trade for a different set of issues. For example, it would probably imply that the existence of two such files would have to be treated as a conflict on Linux, even if both files originated there and are truly different files. But is deleting/renaming one of them acceptable? And which one do you keep? And can one assume that the sets of characters that conflict in filenames on a Mac the same as on other platforms with case-insensitive filenames?\n\n> Do we just pretend it doesn't exist when syncing on Mac?\n\nYes, I guess. I would consider it a local limitation that only one of the files can exist at the same time. If the file is deleted on the Mac, the other file should be synced there as it is then no longer blocked by the file that was deleted.\n\n> When if you then rename `MyFile` to `myfile` on the Mac side, what happens to `MyFile` and `myfile` on the Linux side?\n\nThe rename must surely rename `MyFile` on Linux as well. The question is to what, as `myfile` already exists. I guess there are two options:\n\n1) Consider the rename a replacement of `myfile` which was invisible on the Mac. The main issue with this approach is that `myfile` is lost without confirmation, likely without the user being aware.\n\n2) Consider the rename a sync conflict. One of the files would be renamed to a conflict filename and the other would be named `myfile`. Alternative, both files could be renamed to conflict filenames. Both files would be synced to both machines either way. The main issue with this approach is probably some user confusion about why the rename caused a conflict.\n\nI think 2) is the best option, but maybe someone can think of an even better third one.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/183981119/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Zero3","id":82504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zero3","html_url":"https://github.com/Zero3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zero3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zero3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zero3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zero3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zero3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zero3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zero3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zero3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zero3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":550039715,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTUwMDM5NzE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/550039715","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-14T21:31:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":550039716,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDU1MDAzOTcxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/550039716","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-14T21:31:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-28T15:56:58Z","updated_at":"2016-03-28T15:56:58Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2907","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2907/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues

have Syncthing running via SyncTrayzor with a single instance on a Windows 2012 R2 server hosting multiple folders, each of which is connected to a single Syncthing instance running via SyncTrayzor on a users laptop.  The folders on the server are also shared via SMB for when the user logs on to a device other than their dedicated laptop.\n\nThe folders on the server are populated with data and we install and set up a laptop with a fresh folder to synchronise (this folder contains the basic structure of a windows documents folder, with a few folder redirections, such as desktop and links)\n\nAfter the initial sync on a most laptops we notice errors such as these (specific to the user in question)\n\nThe Downloads.lnk file is present on both sides when the sync starts and will often result in a conflict file being created.\n\n```\n2016-05-03 11:19:43.5268 #1160 [Debug] SyncTrayzor.Syncthing.EventWatcher.SyncthingEventWatcher: Received 6 events \n2016-05-03 11:19:43.5268 #1160 [Debug] SyncTrayzor.Syncthing.SyncthingProcessRunner: [UVYNR] 11:19:43 INFO: Puller (folder \"willenbrocka\", file \"My Settings\\\\links\\\\Downloads.lnk\"): pull: peers who had this file went away, or the file has changed while syncing. will retry later \n```\n\nThis error goes away after a rescan (we have it set to 1 hour as we are using the Filewatcher in Synctrayzor for the immediate changes and frequent scanning of 200+ folders causes huge IO on the server) however as per the log below SyncTrayzor has already successfully sent an API request to scan the folder\n\nCanton7 was extremely helpful and we concluded that SyncTrayzor was sending the API call to Syncthing without issue on [SyncTrayzor issue  256](https://github.com/canton7/SyncTrayzor/issues/256) (starts about halfway down on my reply starting \"This might not be related, but we are seeing this popping up in the logs quite regularly,\"\n\n```\n2016-05-03 11:18:22.7096 #5556 [Debug] SyncTrayzor.Syncthing.EventWatcher.SyncthingEventWatcher: <ItemStarted ID=3284 Time=03/05/2016 11:18:22 Item=my settings\\links\\Downloads.lnk Folder=willenbrocka Type=File Action=Update>\n2016-05-03 11:18:22.7096 #5556 [Debug] SyncTrayzor.Syncthing.TransferHistory.SyncthingTransferHistory: Item started.

What happens is we discover the new name when scanning, but when checking for deleted files we don't see the delete as we get a successful return from Lstat(\"foo\") if there is a FOO so we get both the variants in the index. If there's Linux on the other side, it'll get both copies\n\nIt looks like Lstat returns a FileInfo type which contains the Name() of the file - is it possible on case-insensitive OS's to compare the Name() returned by Lstat to the file name input to Lstat? That should let you know if its a case difference so delete the entry from the index and change the delete routine on case-insensitive OS's to check if the file still exists elsewhere in the index before actually deleting it?\n\nWhen a case-sensitive node creates foo then FOO, the case in-sensitive side would create foo, but then when FOO tries to sync do you check to see if the file already exists on the destination? Does a rename on a case-insensitive client generate a delete, then a create?  So a create when the file already exists and the Name() value differs in case only is a file from a case-sensitive OS with only a case difference, so you can throw an error that files with only a case difference cannot exist on case-insensitive OS?\n\nI would think throwing an error is better than having whichever file was last written to from a case only different set of files on one node to a single file on other nodes.  You can tell which file has synced as the case will match whichever one synced successfully.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/222971115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sfcmgr","id":11537942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM3OTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11537942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr","html_url":"https://github.com/sfcmgr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/222973463","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1787#issuecomment-222973463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1787","id":222973463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjk3MzQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-01T12:10:33Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T12:10:33Z","body":"I think Name() returns whatever you passed into Lstat, and not whats actually on disk.

this is a horrible problem! I'm probably repeating you here, but for my own understanding this helps:\nWindows considers foo and FOO the exact same file when querying for it, as far as fileinfo.Name() is concerned whatever you asked for and was returned is the case on disk, so there is no way to compare filename currently on disk to a filename provided by change operation, only reading the folder contents and finding a case insensitive match in those results.\n\nThe only other place to be case insensitive would be as calmh says the index - when a scan is run and a file is found that needs an action, is a check made to see if that file exists in the index? and is that check case sensitive, if that comparison was changed to be case insensitive on the OS's that don't support case sensitive files would that fix the issue? Or is that what you are referring to by a case insensitive lookup into the index?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/223029969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sfcmgr","id":11537942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM3OTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11537942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr","html_url":"https://github.com/sfcmgr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/223065817","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1787#issuecomment-223065817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1787","id":223065817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzA2NTgxNw==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-01T17:28:47Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T17:28:59Z","body":"> The only other place to be case insensitive would be as calmh says the index - when a scan is run and a file is found that needs an action, is a check made to see if that file exists in the index?\n\nYes. The scan is a two pass operation currently. One pass walks the filesystem and for every file found compares it to the index data in the database. If the file exists in the database and has the same time stamp, modification time, etc it is considered unchanged since last scan. The database lookup is _case sensitive_, so if a file name changes case it is considered a new file at this stage. This is what we expect from a rename - to pick up a new file that we haven't seen before, and scan it.\n\nThe next pass iterates over the contents of the database and verifies that the files mentioned still exist on disk, by doing `lstat()` calls. For a regular rename we pick up the disappearance of the old file here. But on case insensitive systems we will get back success when asking for `Foo` if `fOO` exists on disk - and the `lstat()` call doesn't return the actual file name on disk. (Go synthesizes it for the Name() method, but it's really just the name you asked for to begin with.)\n\nThe reason this is a two pass operation is that we can't in general keep the list of discovered file names in memory, as it may exceed the available RAM. We could, maybe, walk the filesystem and the database in lockstep to make it a single pass, but that would mean we hold a database lock for much much longer than we currently do which might have adverse side effects. We could change the second part to not do `lstat()` calls but instead do `readdir()` on the parent (with suitable caching).\n\nWe still need case insensitive database lookups on Windows and Mac when processing incoming updates. If we get an update from a peer saying \"Here a new file called `Foo`!\" we must be able to check if we already have a file called `fOO` since before to take appropriate action - stop the sync, ignore the file, flag it for conflict or whatever.\n\nIn https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2739 I argue that we should switch to a case insensitive index by default to solve most of this. It's still a lot of work to get there.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/223065817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/223229710","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1787#issuecomment-223229710","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1787","id":223229710,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzIyOTcxMA==","user":{"login":"sfcmgr","id":11537942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM3OTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11537942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr","html_url":"https://github.com/sfcmgr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-02T08:36:29Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T08:36:29Z","body":"Thank you very much for the explanation of the scanning process, it is very helpful and makes the issue here easily understood!\nThe proposed changes in #2739 sounds like an excellent way to go, preventing potential silent data loss on particular OS's and adding the case sensitive functionality if needed by a part of the user base.\n\nUnfortunately this seems like a very big change and probably a long term fix, which is probably unlikely to be shortened by me learning GO and trying to contribute, though if I can help I'll try.\n\nWe've rolled out syncthing to around 100 users now and this is seems a likely cause of #3070 ,but not confirmed, and the only issue left that I'm aware of causing an issue for us, but its pretty serious as files are being skipped- I'll have to warn users about doing case only renames, but they are non-technical and it will still happen.  \n\nI was wondering if you might have any suggestions on how we might track and delete duplicate entries in the index's on both nodes - so it can rescan and add back in a single entry?  Is there an API call that can query and interact with the database? If I understand correctly then #863 suggests to me that once we get a duplicate entry in the index, it stays there and will cause issues with that filename permanently as its never removed?\n\nThat just made me think - if we have a scenario of\n\ncreate foo \n- creates index entry for foo\n\nrename foo to FOO \n- creates index entry for FOO\n- foo entry still present on disk due to case-insensitive reply but meta data out of date as it wasn't picked up on the first scan?\n\nrename FOO to FOO2 \n- marks foo and FOO as deleted\n- creates entry for FOO2\n\nrename FOO2 to foo \n- marks FOO2 as deleted\n- updates foo entry as present?\n\nwill the entry in the index for FOO which is marked as deleted do nothing as the delete operation was completed, or will it delete foo from disk?  If it deletes this potentially means as soon as you do a case only rename on a case insensitive OS you break using that filename with that index?\n\nIt would be useful to be able to fix this for users without them reporting something they don't really understand until a fix is created\n\nThanks!\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/223229710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sfcmgr","id":11537942,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM3OTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11537942?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr","html_url":"https://github.com/sfcmgr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfcmgr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/223235371","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1787#issuecomment-223235371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1787","id":223235371,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMzIzNTM3MQ==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-02T09:01:55Z","updated_at":"2016-06-02T09:01:55Z","body":"So
