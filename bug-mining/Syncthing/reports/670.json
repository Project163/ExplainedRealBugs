After the automatic update to 0.14.38 .stfolder, .stignore (when applicable), .stversions (when applicable) were all unhidden in Syncthing folders. Other hidden files in operating system also became unhidden after upgrade. Although unsure if this spread across operating system or just in Syncthing folders because became aware of this when saw lots of \".tmp\" files (which were unhidden) in Syncthing folders. Not sure if . (dot) files that found in user profile folder were already unhidden or not.\r\n\r\nNot entirely bad thing because learned a new windows command as a result. Running below commands in administrator command prompt solved issue.\r\n\r\nATTRIB +H /s /d C:\\.*\r\nATTRIB +H /s /d C:\\*.tmp\r\n\r\nA backslash needs to come after C: in above command but is being edited out.
