I use a high rescan interval, because I use to work with the data and I dont want to sync before I am done. (work is ususally below 10 min, like copying pictures inside and renaming them.) I set the other side to \"versioning\" and I dont want copies of all that renaming on that side.\r\nAfter mounting, I usually click \"rescan all\" to get them from stopped to alive.\r\n\r\nwhat happend:\r\nWith the change from v0.14.26 to v0.14.27, the functionality of the \"Rescan all\" Button changed.\r\nBefore: \r\nStopped Folders would be checked if they are \"alive\" again\r\nNow:\r\nStopped Folders are skipped during the \"Rescan all\" function\r\n\r\nFolders can only get \"alive\" again, if the rescan interval is due.\r\n\r\nwhat you expected to happen instead:\r\nStopped Folders would be checked if they are \"alive\" again\r\n\r\nany steps to reproduce the problem:\r\nunmount a shared folder \r\nstart Syncthing\r\nrescan the folder > status is \"Stopped\"\r\nmount folder again\r\npress \"Rescan all\" or \"Rescan\" on the individual folder.
