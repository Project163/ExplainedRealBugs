If exist, share it, if not, create it.\n- Trusted device pops in, wants to share a new folder, then another device comes along and wants to share the same folder - folder should be created, and shared with this new devices, just in case, if this devices are trusted one on the main Trusted device who pops.

this field should be changeable, or selectable, just if user click on the Trusted device button)\n\nOn the ask of @calmh , what if ... points... then, syncthing should ask the user, what to do, the 4 options (merge, replace, overwrite or rename).\n\nAnd that's all. (nothing complicated for every user, if the software ask him, what to do, if...)\n\nLike this, for example, if user have an servers around the world, it is not needed to access the servers with teamviewer, or somthing like this, and to accept every share - with this option, user need just once to add the device as Trusted, set the location, and what should happend, if ( @calmh points) - done.\n\nSyncthing become more automatised, and more usable. Just think, if user share a couple of shares, the full internet bandwidth is used, and i need to connect with an remote desktop like teamviewer, or No Machine, the work on this remote machine is

Ok, it can be used on business directions to, but, every hoster, who do the Backups, and such things with Syncthing, would apreciate the automation to.\n\nLike the version 0.12.x with pausing devices, improved refreshing time (allmost no pause time on refreshing now, wonderfull), and all of this ideas are realised, and every person now is happy to have this, it works wonderfull. Maybe, not everyone need the pausing devices, for example, but, the function is there, and \"if\" someone need it, it is there - and this is wonderfull, it works great.\n\nUnfortunatly, i'm not so good on programming, and can not help as much as i wish.
