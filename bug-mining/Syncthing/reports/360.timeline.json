In my case I had setup sync from a Windows desktop to a Linux server - and they are *only* ever changed on the Windows desktop - never on the Linux server. The desktop is set in master/send only mode. In my case it turned out that the reason why the conflict files were being created was because the desktop computer did not have its time synced with the Internet/NTP, and the clock was slow.
