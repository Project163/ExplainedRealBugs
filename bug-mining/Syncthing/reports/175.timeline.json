it seems the \"nowarp\" does not what it should..\n\nwithout the \"nowarp\": (This seems more desirable for me)\nFireFox:\n![firefoxwin7_nonowrap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7719800/5629986/e624a02c-95fc-11e4-992e-723b3014751c.PNG)\n\nIE7:\n![iewin7_nonowrap](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7719800/5629987/eb669540-95fc-11e4-968b-2f4d548991ce.PNG)\n\nBecause I don´t want that space, when we are in the small gui, I changed the above code:\nfrom:\n\n```\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-hdd hidden-xs\"></span>&emsp;{{folder.ID}}\"\n```\n\nto: \n\n```\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-hdd hidden-xs\">&emsp;</span>{{folder.ID}}\"\n```\n\nThis happens:\nAgain FireFox first:\n![firefoxwin7_hiddenspace1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7719800/5630053/8d984c28-95fd-11e4-9551-0207d159993e.PNG)\n![firefoxwin7_hiddenspace2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7719800/5630054/90ce65e4-95fd-11e4-9aef-48baafcb50fa.PNG)\n\nSo all looks fine.\n\nBut IE:\n![iewin7_hiddenspace1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7719800/5630059/9c10dc16-95fd-11e4-8faa-ee276c7235e6.PNG)\n![iewin7_hiddenspace2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7719800/5630063/a076e9ee-95fd-11e4-9060-06e1784755bb.PNG)\n\nMy questions would be:\n- What about the space situation.\n- The way I made the hidden box, is that ok? (with the double text, or can this be done more elegant?)\n\nYou can see my changes in
