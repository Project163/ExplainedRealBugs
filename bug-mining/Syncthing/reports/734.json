found a curious behaviour when deleting directories and creating symbolic links.\n\nConsider two machines One and Two. In One I make a directory A with a file a and a directory B with the same file a and another file b:\n\n> ## 1\n> \n>  One:~$ mkdir A B; touch A/a; cp A/a B; touch B/b; ls -R\n> A:\n> a\n> B:\n> a b\n\nI wait until both machines are synchronized. Later I remove directory A and replace it by a symbolic link to B\n\n> ## 2\n> \n>  One:~$ rm -r A; ln -s B A; ls -R \n>   A:\n>   a b\n>   B:\n>   a b\n\nSynchronization fails at Two when it tries to delete A because the directory is not empty.\n\n> ## 3\n> \n> Two:~$ ls -R \n> A:\n> a\n> B:\n> a b\n\nTo allow synchronization to complete, I remove the directory A\n\n> ## 4\n> \n> Two:~$ rm -r A; ls B\n> a b\n\nAfter synchronization completes A becomes a symbolic link in machine Two, as expected, but with the undesired consequence that in the process file a disappeared from directory B in both machines, whereas it was deleted from directory A in machine Two where it was not linked to directory B.\n\n> ## 5\n> \n> One:~$ ls -R\n> A:\n> b\n> B:\n> b\n> \n> Two:~$ ls -R\n> A:\n> b\n> B:\n> b\n\nIf I wait after deleting A in machine One in step ##2 above, allowing synchronization to occur, and afterwards make the symbollic link, synchronization doesn't fail and I do not loose any file\n\n> ## 2bis\n> \n>  One:~$ rm -r A; sleep 120; ln -s B A; ls -R \n>   A:\n>   a b\n>   B:\n>   a b\n> ## 3bis\n> \n> Two:~$ ls -R \n> A:\n> a b\n> B:\n> a b\n\nI am scanning my directories every minute. So it seems that syncthing gets confused when I perform the two operations, delete a directory and immediately substitute it by a symbolic link, before the first change is detected and synched.\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2571/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
