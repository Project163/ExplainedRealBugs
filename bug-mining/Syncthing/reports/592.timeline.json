purpose see #3899, short recap:\r\nCreating temporary names and testing whether a name is temporary is a \"static\" test, meaning it is set at `init()` and never changed again. Passing it around from the models module is overly complicated and pointless. So this PR centralizes these functions in the ignore package for easy access for all libraries.\r\n\r\nI also refactored the function `shouldIgnore` in models.go: The part that checks whether the filename is either internal, temporary or ignored is handled by `ShouldIgnore` in the ignores package. This might seem unnecessary, as it is currently only used in models.go, but it contextually belongs there and such a function will be needed in fswatcher as well. Shouldn't hurt, right? \r\n\r\nThe model tests (in specific rwfolder_test.go) use static test data with temporary windows prefixes. These were set in `init()` of the test itself, which worked as the prefix is an internal variable of the same package. Now it is an internal variable of the ignore package. I resolved this by adding an exported function to the ignore package, that manually sets the prefix to the windows type. I considered this less bad than exporting the prefix itself.\r\nIs there any better way to both protect this variable in production and allow to set it for tests?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3901/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":925299252,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTI1Mjk5MjUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/925299252","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"dbb3a34887b40b730c045700c1705859187f9016","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/dbb3a34887b40b730c045700c1705859187f9016","created_at":"2017-01-17T07:33:55Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1429789849,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE0Mjk3ODk4NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1429789849","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-18T07:00:51Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1429789852,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTQyOTc4OTg1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1429789852","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-18T07:00:51Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
