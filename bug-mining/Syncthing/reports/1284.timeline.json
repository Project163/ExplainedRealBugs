default ignores. Those are applied when a folder is auto-accepted. When adding a folder in the web UI, it checks if there is a pre-existing `.stignore` file at the new folder path (through a new `/rest/system/readignores` endpoint), and if not uses the defaults.\r\n\r\nThe defaults are stored in the config folder in a file named `default-stignore`. The can be modified through the `/rest/db/defaultignores` endpoint. `/rest/db` hardly is the right place for this, but `/rest/db/ignores` already exists. And it's not obvious to me where to put it: Putting it into an own group feels like overkill (`/rest/ignores/folder/folder-id` and `/rest/ignores/default`) and moving to `/rest/system` isn't much better than `/rest/db`. Suggestions for a better endpoint and filename are welcome :) \r\n\r\nTesting: I can change defaults and they appear when adding a new
