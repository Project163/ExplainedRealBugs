Setup\r\n\r\nI **sync a directory between Linux and Windows 10**.\r\nVersioning off, watching for changes enabled on both sides.\r\n\r\n### What happened\r\n\r\nWhen I **create a symlink on Linux**, and I wait for the **rescan** time (or I click rescan on Linux and then click rescan on Windows) the **symlink gets deleted on Linux side**.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the symlink doses not appear on Windows is expected, what is annoying is that it gets removed on Linux side when the Windows client syncs back.\r\n\r\n### What was expected\r\n\r\nThe **symlink** created on Linux **should stay present on Linux**.\r\n\r\n### For reproducing the bug\r\n\r\nSync a directory between Linux and Windows 10.\r\nCreate a symlink in the directory on Linux side.\r\nClick on rescan button on Linux side.\r\nClick on rescan button on Windows side.\r\nCheck if the symlink is still existing on Linux side.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version on Linux: v0.14.49 \"Dysprosium
