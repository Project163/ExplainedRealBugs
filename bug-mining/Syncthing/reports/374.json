I have a repository that is shared with my own PC (Windows 8.1 x64 running Syncthing 0.12.2) and another remote PC (Windows 7 x64 running Syncthing 0.12.2). Both machines are running Syncthing through SyncTrayzor 1.0.29.\n\nSometimes, when I change the name of a folder that contains files/more folders on my PC, Syncthing on the other PC begins to completely redownload all the files into the new folder and then deletes the old folder and its contents afterwards, instead of creating a new folder and moving the existing files there. The same happens to file renames.\n\nThe same goes for changing files, instead of downloading only the changed blocks, Syncthing on the remote PC downloads the entire file and replaces the old one.\n\nThis appears to happen randomly as I've seen a few occassions where changing folder/file names does gets handled as expected. I wonder if anyone else has noticed something similar happening. Would it maybe help for me to remake my Syncthing repositories?\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2455/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
