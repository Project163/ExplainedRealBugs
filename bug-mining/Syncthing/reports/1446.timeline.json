actually the problem here seems to be not Syncthing but my networking setup. The fd7a address is Tailscale, and how that is set up network-wise differs between Mac and Linux. On Mac there is a tunnel interface:\r\n\r\n```\r\nutun4: flags=8051<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,MULTICAST> mtu 1280\r\n\toptions=6460<TSO4,TSO6,CHANNEL_IO,PARTIAL_CSUM,ZEROINVERT_CSUM>\r\n\tinet6 fe80::f0ed:7e22:2e82:5b83%utun4 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x16\r\n\tinet 100.85.40.61 --> 100.85.40.61 netmask 0xffffffff\r\n\tinet6 fd7a:115c:a1e0::7301:283d prefixlen 48\r\n\tnd6 options=201<PERFORMNUD,DAD>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote prefixlen 48 on the fd7a address, so Syncthing will see fd7a:115c:a1e0::/48 as a local network.\r\n\r\nOn Linux, the interface is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n135: tailscale0: <POINTOPOINT,MULTICAST,NOARP,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1280 qdisc fq_codel state UNKNOWN group default qlen 500\r\n    link/none\r\n    inet 100.116.72.128/32 scope global tailscale0\r\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\r\n    inet6 fd7a:115c:a1e0::5501:4880/128 scope global\r\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\r\n    inet6 fe80::d865:aa9f:518a:9904/64 scope link stable-privacy\r\n       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, a /128 address and nothing else, accompanied by a route for the /48 (not shown here), but that means Syncthing doesn't see it as a LAN.\r\n\r\nAnd really, the Linux side does it better here, because there is no reason in my setup for the connections to go via Tailscale when there is an alternative direct IPv4 network they can use...","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/2363305046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14337322333,"node_id":"LE_lADOAOCAEs6XS_y7zwAAAANWki1d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/14337322333","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-20T09:42:32Z","label":{"name":"needs-triage","color":"ce23af"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/2363319821","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9719#issuecomment-2363319821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9719","id":2363319821,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAOCAEs6M3WYN","user":{"login":"bt90","id":1926175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjYxNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1926175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90","html_url":"https://github.com/bt90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-20T09:49:05Z","updated_at":"2024-09-20T09:49:05Z","body":"Is
