Purpose\r\n\r\nCurrently cluster configs are built based on the folders in the model internals. Paused folders are removed from the model, so they don't get into the cluster config. Thus to another device it looks like the folder was removed/unshared. This in itself is already incorrect. If this happens to all folders shared with one device, this device is removed on the remote if we are marked as introducer (#4897).\r\n \r\nThis delegates the creation of cluster configs to the config package and only adds the\r\nindex IDs and sequence numbers in the model. It also ensures that all lists of devices and\r\nfolders in the config are sorted by ID.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nAdded a test to check that the cluster config contains paused
