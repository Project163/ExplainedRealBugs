You're probably right about the unexpected `*` pattern behavior. I just realize that git does not version empty directories and therefore does not suffer from this problem. I'm not sure why git does it like that, but I think not synchronizing empty directories in general could also be unintuitive. Still, it could be a solution.\nAlso, I found out that my `!(?)` attempt was double if not triple wrong. First, according to 9fed75d59c1ea5d008eddc41d519c5ddeabc5751, the actual modifier for case-insensitive patterns is `(?i)` and not `(?)`, contrary to what [this wiki page](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/wiki/Ignoring-Files) says. Then, I did not even use version 11.0, where the feature was introduced. Finally however, since I am on Windows, according to #1511, my patterns are supposed to be case-insensitive _anyway_! So maybe the first point does not require a fix at all (will try this later), but the second point remains.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/95578539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rolve","id":2384850,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODQ4NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2384850?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolve","html_url":"https://github.com/rolve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rolve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":294586650,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5NDU4NjY1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/294586650","actor":{"login":"Zillode","id":14169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode","html_url":"https://github.com/Zillode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e3cae69495e9841b07ef7a5856dde15cd0f15512","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Zillode/syncthing/commits/e3cae69495e9841b07ef7a5856dde15cd0f15512","created_at":"2015-04-30T22:58:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/97994738","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1678#issuecomment-97994738","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1678","id":97994738,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3OTk0NzM4","user":{"login":"Zillode","id":14169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode","html_url":"https://github.com/Zillode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-30T23:00:10Z","updated_at":"2015-04-30T23:00:10Z","body":"Use
