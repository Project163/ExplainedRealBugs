New files can be reconstructed from existing files on the remote, so delay anything that was deleted (i.e. also delete&create) by 6x the wait time too.  \r\nI mean I can come up with a scenario, but it is not very convincing: Rename file A to B, create a different file A and keep modifying the new file B, without changing its content much/at all. Then if A wasn't delayed, B wouldn't be reconstructed from A on the remote (as A was already replaced).\r\n\r\nHowever I think it's fine to err on the save side, so unless someone has some convincing arguments against it, I'd keep the current behaviour.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/388865997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/388868345","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4953#issuecomment-388868345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4953","id":388868345,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODg2ODM0NQ==","user":{"login":"Ferroin","id":905151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/905151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin","html_url":"https://github.com/Ferroin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-14T15:55:38Z","updated_at":"2018-05-14T15:55:38Z","body":"IMO, the current behavior (10 second batching for most stuff, 6x that for deletion or multiple modifications) is sensible for most use cases, but it would be kind of nice to be able to tweak both values on a per-folder  basis. As a couple of examples:\r\n\r\n* I have a folder where I have a bunch of playlists, and when I edit those, I do so pretty slowly, and would much rather batch _all_ the changes I make into one update, so for that folder, it would be nice to be able to bump up both values significantly.\r\n\r\n* On the other side of things, I do have a small handful of things where changes are very infrequent and consist of single writes, but I want them propagated as fast as possible, even if it means that data may not be reused as much as it otherwise would.  In this case, it would be wonderful to just drop the batching down to 1 second, and remove the multiplier.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/388868345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Ferroin","id":905151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/905151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin","html_url":"https://github.com/Ferroin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/388874812","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4953#issuecomment-388874812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4953","id":388874812,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4ODg3NDgxMg==","user":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-14T16:15:06Z","updated_at":"2018-05-14T16:15:06Z","body":"Lets continue this discussion on the forum: https://forum.syncthing.net/t/discussing-fs-watcher-delays-4953/11593\r\n\r\nI am not dismissing the issue, it's a legitimate question and there might be need for change, but there is still clearly need to explain and discuss before a clear path forward (if any) turns up.

Purpose\r\n\r\nSee #4953  and https://forum.syncthing.net/t/discussing-fs-watcher-delays-4953  \r\nWhen the watcher sends events, it now checks if the only remaining (=delayed) events are removals. If it is the case, these removals don't need to be delayed any further and are thus sent right away.\r\n\r\nTo do that it is necessary to keep track of how many events of which types are currently tracked. So instead of iterating over the \"event-tree\" whenever total count is needed, the aggregator now has a `counts` field which is continuously updated.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI added a removal event to the end of the existing `TestDelay` test. To check that it is sent immediately, I needed to refactor the test setup, which unfortunately didn't get any simpler in the process. I also added some `t.Helper()`s and more detailed error reporting, which I needed to debug the tests (not the actual production code...).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4955/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4955/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1647810250,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTY0NzgxMDI1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1647810250","actor":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"a83176c77ac562ed9e9e38ad40ee5b3e9290ad5a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/a83176c77ac562ed9e9e38ad40ee5b3e9290ad5a","created_at":"2018-05-26T09:08:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1659588672,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2NTk1ODg2NzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1659588672","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ea271204f3f5f5d0bde0185f27e1636d0632a02c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/calmh/syncthing/commits/ea271204f3f5f5d0bde0185f27e1636d0632a02c","created_at":"2018-06-02T11:15:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1662861960,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDE2NjI4NjE5NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1662861960","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-05T06:10:41Z","milestone":{"title":"v0.14.49"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1673897939,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MTY3Mzg5NzkzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1673897939","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com

the discussion on the forum is as old as this, and someone is looking at this, I'll comment here. I **really** dislike the delay in deleting files. I use syncthing to help me do data analysis on a remote server. A common workflow is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Run a script on `remote` that creates a figure\r\n2. Wait for syncthing to sync that figure to `local`\r\n3. Inspect figure on `local`\r\n4. Realize I've made a mistake, edit the script, repeat from 1.\r\n\r\nNow when I rerun, usually the new file has the same name as the old. So because of this delay in fs_watcher, the latency is seeing changes is 60 seconds. This delay is very annoying and I can't figure out a way to change it.\r\n\r\nInotify was almost instantaneous for this process, and I would really like to see this with

explained in https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4953, the current integrated file system watcher has a lag of 10s before syncing. The previous inotify solution was almost instantaneous, in my experience.\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if you would speed up the new watcher to be as good as instantaneous (e.g. 1s instead of 10s), or at least make this configurable.\r\n\r\nOur setup that makes this important:\r\n\r\nWe are running a web based development platform off a central server (for reasons too complicated to explain here), with the possibility of on-the-fly changes to the GUI. In order to be able to develop using IDEs, we are using Syncthing to propagate code changes from code base on the developers laptop onto the server, which is then served on the web.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we could make some changes in the IDE, and in the time it took to change into the browser and refresh the page, the code change would have been propagated. Thus, we had real-time GUI programming even though the code was edited on a laptop and the web server was running on a separate server.\r\n\r\nNow, however, the 10s lag in the new file watcher creates annoying small breaks in the development cycle, where we have to wait to make sure the changes have been propagated.\r\n\r\nI suppose a 1s lag is too demanding on the CPU / disk for most users, but to make this configurable would be great for users like us!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5431/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2368506434,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzNjg1MDY0MzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2368506434","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-27T07:05:12Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2368506454,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MjM2ODUwNjQ1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2368506454","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-27T07:05:12Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
