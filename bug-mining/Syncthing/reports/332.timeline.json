This is sadly not so common on\nthe general internet, but more common in campus and corporate networks.\n\nEven in home and SOHO type networks it's valuable, for example between a\nwired and wireless segment, or across a VPN hop.\n\nFor comparison, btsync uses multicast discovery with a TTL (hop count) of\n3. That's in ipv4, I don't recall them supporting v6 at all. This let\ndiscovery work in exactly the above cases; one of the very few aspects of\nthat program I still miss.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/125045379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dcarosone","id":11495017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk1MDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11495017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcarosone","html_url":"https://github.com/dcarosone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcarosone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcarosone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcarosone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcarosone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcarosone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcarosone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcarosone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcarosone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dcarosone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/125099505","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2090#issuecomment-125099505","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2090","id":125099505,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNTA5OTUwNQ==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-27T06:15:05Z","updated_at":"2015-07-27T06:17:54Z","body":"Myeah, so `ff32::` in this case is link-local, transient, based on network prefix. The first two are correct, the latter isn't. So I guess `ff12::` may be the prefix we're looking for (link-local, transient). \"Transient\" in this case meaning \"not assigned by IANA\". http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.7\n\nI don't think SSM or not is encoded in the address here, other than by some guidelines on how to select SSM addresses.
