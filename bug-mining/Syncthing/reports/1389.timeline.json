be clear, this is not the upgrade check, it's the actual upgrade download. The upgrade check, which happens somewhat frequently (for example every time a newer machine connects to us) goes to upgrades.syncthing.net which is our own server, with caching, entirely sidestepping the github API limits.\r\n\r\nHowever, when an upgrade is deemed possible and necessary the asset is downloaded from the GitHub release, which is what happens here (and gets rejected). I suspect think that's a fairly unusual situation, as it is literally one \"API request\" (actually zip/tar.gz download) per released version.\r\n\r\nEven with your cluster of five machines, Syncthing would normally cause _five_ such API requests, in total, per month. But if they fail, they will of course be retried at some point. So, I don't think it's fair to say we trigger the limit in question.

However, after digging into this and looking at network traffic I have not identified anything else that would be interacting with api.github.com repeatedly and exhausting that rate limit that isn't traceable to syncthing.  I agree that there is a non-zero chance that syncthing is an innocent bystander but I haven't identified another culprit yet and I don't run any software that utilizes the GH API that I'm aware of.  I'll continue to look for something else though.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's not a cluster of 5 machines - it is a cluster of about 10-15 or so devices (not all of which are continuously connected) with only half of them behind this NAT gateway.  I'm not sure if that changes the situation at all.\r\n\r\nRegardless, no matter what is going on I feel that checking the http status code and honoring the x-rate-limit flag should be a good

So - I think it is safe to say that syncthing was (mostly) an innocent bystander but it does contribute to the problem slightly by accessing assets hosted on GH via the api.\r\n\r\nSo, while technically not-a-bug - I think syncthing's behavior could be improved by:\r\n\r\n1) paying attention to http status codes when fetching remote resources and logging a meaningful error message on failure\r\n2) if a rate limit response is returned, honor the x-ratelimit-rest header instead of continuing to make requests and log the message so it is clear to the user what is happening\r\n\r\nPotential feature request?  Should I go post this in the forum?\r\n1) Provide a mechanism for configuring and using personal GH tokens to fetch GH resources since they have a much more generous rate limit\r\n\r\nIf nothing else - a FAQ entry would be nice.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1671901503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alyandon","id":852730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MjczMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/852730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyandon","html_url":"https://github.com/alyandon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyandon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyandon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyandon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyandon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyandon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyandon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyandon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyandon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alyandon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1671911751","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9033#issuecomment-1671911751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9033","id":1671911751,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAOCAEs5jp1lH","user":{"login":"bt90","id":1926175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjYxNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1926175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90","html_url":"https://github.com/bt90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-09T18:13:04Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T18:13:04Z","body":"The status should be properly logged.
