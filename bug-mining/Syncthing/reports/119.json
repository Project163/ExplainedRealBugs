I think this is because an icon is being used rather than text here. \nIt appears in the edit menu where settings, and show device id and such is.\n\n```\n<li class=\"dropdown\">\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"dropdown-toggle\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\"><span class=\"glyphicon     glyphicon-cog\"></span></a>\n          <ul class=\"dropdown-menu\">\n```\n\nHere is my preposed change, to add an aria-label=\"label\" attribute to the link. this causes a screen reader to associate that text with the link, as such. Another slightly less elegant solution is to put a p tag in the link itself, with a style of \"font-size:1px;\" but this seems much less readable.\n\n```\n<li class=\"dropdown\">\n          <a href=\"#\" class=\"dropdown-toggle\" data-toggle=\"dropdown\"         aria-label=\"Edit\"><span             class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-cog\"></span></a>\n```\n\nThis seems to be the only access issue for people with visual impairements in the whole web ui. Nice job.\n","closed_by":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1020/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
