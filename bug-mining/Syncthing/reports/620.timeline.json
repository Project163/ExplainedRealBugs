Consider that you get the \"share folder\" prompt because another device want to share the photos folder with you. You have a photos folder to share, but there are some files in it that should not be shared. Today you'd have to create the folder, make sure it's not shared with another device, then set the ignore patterns and make sure a rescan happens, and then share the folder with the other device. \n\nThat's apart from the generally work saving measure of excluding the large ISO files you don't want shared, at  creation time. A scan isn't cancelable so otherwise you're stuck waiting for the unnecessary scan to complete before the files can be ignored.

would like to make a suggestion.\r\nWhen you create a shared folder, it is currently not possible to define an exclusion list before validating. Hence, the indexing starts by default in the whole folder, and continues while your go back to the folder setting and populate the exclusion list. It's problematic, for example, when you want to exclude the \"#recycle\" folder inside a Synology NAS, which may contains huge amount of files.\r\n\r\nWould it be easy/possible to have access to the ignore list directly during the definition of the shared folder ?\r\n\r\nThanks !\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: all\r\nOS Version:
