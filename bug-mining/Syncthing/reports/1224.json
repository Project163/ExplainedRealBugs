Which folders are or not encrypted is set when the connection is created. At the time the code was written that was ok, as we dropped a connections when any folder changed. Now we don't anymore, thus adding an encrypted folder doesn't make that connection encrypted until the connection is dropped (restart, device pause, ...).\r\n\r\nShould this go into the changelog? It's definitely a \"note-worthy\" bug, but the untrusted feature is still in testing/preview. Not sure.\r\n\r\nThe point about having to pause and resume the folder to make anything happen is unrelated (did repro but don't yet know why it happens).","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
