The `fs.File`s as currently envisioned in the other PR support both `io.ReaderAt` and `io.WriterAt` meaning `CopyRange` has a simple, generic implementation.

should use the [FICLONERANGE](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl_ficlonerange.2.html) ioctl to clone data it already has instead of doing a dumb `read` + `write`.\r\n\r\nThis would improve performance and disk usage immensely on CoW filesystems.\r\n\r\nI ran into this scenario today. I have one shared folder with the following structure:\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n    directory\r\n        subdirectory{0..n}\r\n```\r\nIt has about 360GB of stuff scattered amongst the subdirectories.\r\n\r\nI decided to reorganize `directory` by adding one additional level of \"category\" directories and moving the original subdirectories into them:\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n    directory\r\n        category{0..n}\r\n            subdirectory{0..n}\r\n```\r\nThen I ran the folder rescan. Once the remote device started updating, it took a very long time. In total only about 120MB were transferred, so it clearly knew to get the data from the files it already had.\r\n\r\nI did a cursory `find . -type f -exec stat -c '%w %i %n' | sort` in the directory on the remote side afterwards, and it seems that while it was able to do a file move for about half of the files, for some reason it decided to create new files and dutifully - but slowly - copy the contents over from the old files, over the course of about 2 hours.\r\n\r\nIf it had instead cloned the data from the old files, it would have been done much quicker and without extra disk usage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6643/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/629533952","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4271#issuecomment-629533952","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4271","id":629533952,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyOTUzMzk1Mg==","user":{"login":"tlhonmey","id":5862235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjIyMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5862235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlhonmey","html_url":"https://github.com/tlhonmey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlhonmey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlhonmey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlhonmey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlhonmey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlhonmey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlhonmey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlhonmey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlhonmey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tlhonmey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-15T22:33:13Z","updated_at":"2020-05-15T22:33:13Z","body":"Note also that NTFS supports a similar type of deduplication, but only via whole-volume sweep operations (as far as I can find anyway.)
