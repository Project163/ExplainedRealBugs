When I reboot my device, I don't automatically mount them so I expectedly get \"folder path missing\" error. However, when I have local changes, that's the status I see. I believe the failure status (\"Stopped\" if I remember correctly) should be displayed instead of \"Local Additions\".\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n- Create a Receive Only folder\r\n- Make local changes and wait for \"Local Additions\" to be displayed in the web UI.\r\n- Delete the folder completely\r\n- Restart Syncthing\r\n- Observe that the folder status still shows as \"Local Additions\" and the error \"folder path missing\" is displayed in the folder details.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"566\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-06-24 at 1 26 02 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/732128/85624675-20dfca00-b61f-11ea-8be0-7476e57f0999.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nSyncthing v1.6.1\r\nmacOS 11.0 (Big Sur) Beta","closed_by":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6793/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
