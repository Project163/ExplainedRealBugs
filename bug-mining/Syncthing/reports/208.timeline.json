I meant that if the local transfer speed is limited (choked) to the same speed as the WAN connections, there isn't really a speed bonus for having a local node which is always on.\n\nI currently have four locations with 2-5 Syncthing devices each plus one \"stupid storage node\", but right now I can only choose between throttling all upload and none.\nWhile the first option means very slow sync on the LAN, the second one means unhappy family/friends, because their upload bandwidth is completely blocked, meaning calls that \"the internet is slow\".\n\nI'd never ask to strip encryption anywhere, no worries ;-)\n\nWith this I just wanted to underline that it would be very much appreciated if there were a button to ignore the bandwidth limit on local connections. A second set of up/down bandwidths for local connections would probably be too confusing to the average user.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/76834675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"generalmanager","id":6797943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTc5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6797943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager","html_url":"https://github.com/generalmanager","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/76841862","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1336#issuecomment-76841862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1336","id":76841862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2ODQxODYy","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-02T22:35:08Z","updated_at":"2015-03-02T22:35:08Z","body":"Yeah,

Which is an improvement, because before the connections would timeout, but still.\n\nThis is also not a solution for most users, because they have no idea this might exist (many routers don't support it) or ever logged into their router. And they don't call it router, it's the little box where all the cables go (not the one for electricity).\n\nThus I'd like the Syncthing setting to be as useful as possible. \n\nRegarding your proposal: I think we should try to keep  the UI clutter as low as possible, thus this should only be shown if the user entered an address manually. In this case there was no discovery service involved and we can't classify the device in any other way. But most users will use local and global discovery - they don't need to see this all the time.\n\nAnd in times where laptops have a bigger marketshare than traditional PCs, it's often not possible any more to define a device as strictly accessible via a local network. \n\nI think it can solve an edge case for which the method proposed by @AudriusButkevicius doesn't work, but shouldn't get in the way as long as it's not
