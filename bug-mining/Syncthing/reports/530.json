I understand these are db files enabling the delta-indexing algorithm. In the past I would ignore folders by placing a \"cachedir.tag\" file into folders I don't want backed up.\nIn this case I was puzzled by their naming scheme though- they are called \"tmp*\" -something , but don't seem to be more temporal than the actual database-folder. My initial thought was thus not to place the cachedir.tag -files there, since \"tmp\"-folders tend to get cleaned up at times (?!)\nAlso, there are quite a number of \"tmp-index-sorter\"-folders, and it looks untidy. O:-) At least much less tidy than I am used to from syncthing.\nWouldn't it make more sense to at least put all the index-related db-folders into an extra subfolder say $st_home/index/ ?\n\nSo I guess I am proposing both a naming-scheme change and a location change...\nEDIT: Just saw this related https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3449 closed issue, so I guess you guys are somewhat aware of the issue\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3529/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
