I hover the mouse over it hoping for pop-up explanatory text, _but nothing appears_.\r\n\r\nI have no idea what this button does, but I'm too scared to press it as:\r\n* I don't know what it does\r\n* It may may be irreversible\r\n\r\n[I enter the search terms in the wiki and no results appear.](https://docs.syncthing.net/search.html?q=global+changes&check_keywords=yes&area=default#) \r\n\r\n### What I expect to happen instead\r\n\r\nI see a button with a unwinding clock and the text \"Global Changes\". I hover the mouse over it hoping for pop-up explanatory text, _and explanatory text appears_.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the explanatory text has a link to a page with detailed explanation. \r\nA page exists in the wiki, such that a search for the phrase \"global changes\" brings up the page.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nI remember having difficulty finding the explanation of this button before. _\\*months pass\\*_.
