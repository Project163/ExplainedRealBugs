If I have 100 users, each with 3 devices, each wanting to sync 10 different folders, that brings the number of folders to 1000. Getting the full config with that long list of folders, each with useless details attached to it, and full config which includes a useless list of devices, just to let the user know that one folder on the server is shared or not, is most probably going to get the server unusable.
