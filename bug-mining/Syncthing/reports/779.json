THE ISSUE\r\nSyncthing erases the execute file mode from script files after syncing the file from Windows, making users always have to remember to chmod the file whenever it's changed in the Windows machine.\r\n\r\n### REPRO STEPS\r\n* Set up syncthing between a Linux machine and a Windows machine.\r\n* On Linux, create a script file and chmod it to enable execute.\r\n* Wait for the file to be sync'ed on Windows, and then edit the file's contents.\r\n* When the file edits are sync'ed to the Linux machine, observe the file mode.\r\n\r\n###EXPECTED\r\n The execute file mode remains.\r\n\r\n###ACTUAL\r\nThe execute file mode is erased.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4969/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
