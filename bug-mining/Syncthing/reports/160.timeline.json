Actually I tried to create a UPnP mapping with the name syncthing manually and my router complained I ended up creating a syncthingSOMETHINGSOMETHING one.\nMy router also doesn't seem to like to overwrite previously existing mappings, you explicitly have to delete them, I guess, if I can fing that weird page with all the mappings listed. \nI understand now, thank you very much, the world makes sense again!! I'll clean things up in the router (if I can find the damn settings page again, I swear router interfaces are illogical on purpose) test this and let you know!\n\nThanks!\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/66438165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nbonacchi","id":7206665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMDY2NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7206665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbonacchi","html_url":"https://github.com/nbonacchi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbonacchi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbonacchi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbonacchi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbonacchi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbonacchi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbonacchi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbonacchi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbonacchi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nbonacchi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":205449352,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MjA1NDQ5MzUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/205449352","actor":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-12-10T11:26:57Z","rename":{"from":"UPnP
