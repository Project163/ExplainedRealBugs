I'd also like to change the color of the \"downloading\"status to something less alarming and reserve red as a clear warning color for this unfortunate state. In addition files/folders with such problems should be listed on top of the other out of sync files and the whole line should be permanently red, to underscore that the user has to do something about it.\r\n\r\nNow there is the rare case of people who knowingly add such directories and still want to sync the other stuff apart from unreadable or symlinked files/folders. The ideal solution would be to keep a list of ignored paths per shared folder, which don't trigger this warning with a nice \"ignore this path in the future\" button next to the warning in the out of sync dialog.\r\n\r\nBut I'd be perfectly happy to have a general \"don't show me such warnings for this shared folder\" boolean for now, even though it doesn't cover the case of shared folders with known problematic paths, where other unsyncable files are unknowingly added later on.\r\nIn this case one will never be notified of the new problems, because these kinds of errors are completely ignored already.
