It does eventually get there, but on lower powered devices it takes a very long time.\r\n\r\nI've worked around this in:\r\nhttps://github.com/hireworksltd/syncthing/tree/remotefolderpaused-test\r\nbut I'm not completely familiar with the codebase and this seems like it could be a pretty expensive check to make if there are a lot of devices connected.\r\n\r\nAny advice welcome!\r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\nJon\n\n### Syncthing version\n\nv.1.27.9\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nLinux amd64\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9686/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
