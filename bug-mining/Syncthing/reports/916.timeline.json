It's in no way assured that after `model.Stop` there won't be any such calls (exported functions on `Model`, `go sendIndexes`, probably more). Now I could add some `closed` channel to `Model` and try to check for that wherever necessary, but that's both tedious and error prone. A bit less error prone but just as or even more tedious would be to  make `leveldb.DB` a named member of `db.Lowlevel` and add such a close condition on `db.Lowlevel`, which then protects all functions on `leveldb.DB`. And all of that just for tests, as otherwise we never create multiple models.  \r\nAny ideas for elegant solutions?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/460327730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2278887994,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIyNzg4ODc5OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2278887994","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"22a71a4b6835938a1ce98ea1fa87ab4c493b80a3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imsodin/syncthing/commits/22a71a4b6835938a1ce98ea1fa87ab4c493b80a3","created_at":"2019-04-16T08:25:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2305200073,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzMDUyMDAwNzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2305200073","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1c98056c8fc06878b4c48179f9581b8bf5a8e6ef","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imsodin/syncthing/commits/1c98056c8fc06878b4c48179f9581b8bf5a8e6ef","created_at":"2019-04-28T11:06:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2305340116,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzMDUzNDAxMTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2305340116","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referen
