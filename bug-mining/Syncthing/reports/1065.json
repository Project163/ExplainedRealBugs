Two new flags can also be used to affect the location of the configuration (`-config`) and database (`-data`) separately. The old `-home` flag is equivalent to setting both of these to the same directory. When no flags are given the following logic is used to determine the data location:\r\n\r\n- If a database exists in the old default location, that location is still used. This means existing installations are not affected by this change.\r\n- If `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set, use `$XDG_DATA_HOME/syncthing`.\r\n- If `~/.local/share/syncthing` exists, use that location.\r\n- Use the old default location.\r\n\r\nThis logic is used on non-Windows, non-Mac platforms only. On Windows and Mac the logic is unchanged.\r\n","creator":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":66,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-18T19:49:05Z","updated_at":"2020-05-05T06:03:45Z","due_on":"2020-05-05T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-05-05T06:03:45Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-04-01T23:57:44Z","updated_at":"2021-04-08T07:02:43Z","closed_at":"2020-04-07T08:23:41Z","author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"More details in [this forum post](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/changes-only-propagating-one-direction/14703/16). \r\n\r\nWith a directory setup on the server like this:\r\n\r\n    subdir/subsubdir/new.txt\r\n\r\nAnd ignores setup on Android phone to only sync subdir/subdir and not any subdir/subdirx like this:\r\n\r\n    !/subdir/subsubdir\r\n    *\r\n\r\n> New file created on phone: no log entries, not synced to server\r\n> New file created on server: file sync’d to phone\r\n> Existing file on both, deleted on phone or server, correctly deleted on both\r\n> Existing file on both, edited on server: sync’d to phone correctly\r\n> Existing file on both, edited on phone: not sync’d to server, no log entries.\r\n> Now if that file is subsequently edited on the server, a sync-conflict file is correctly created on both devices.\r\n> To summarize: new files created on phone are not sync’d, nor are changes made on the phone to existing files.
