One machine is a Linux desktop.\r\n>\r\n> I’m sharing with Android on external, FAT formatted, SD card. The syncthing version is Catfriend’s syncthing fork, running 1.1.3.\r\n>\r\n> Android has Receive Only and Ignore Permissions set.\r\n>\r\n> Each time syncthing is restarted on both machines, syncthing on the Linux machine reports that syncing with the Android device has stalled. On the Android device I look in the Web GUI section and have to press “Revert Local Changes” (even though nothing has changed).\r\n>\r\n> The problem is fixed if I set Ignore Permissions on the Linux box, too.\r\n>\r\n> Some questions:\r\n>\r\n> Is this normal behaviour? That is, is it normal that if both Receive Only and Ignore Permissions are set on the Android device, permission differences on the Android device show up as local changes that have to be reverted?\r\n>\r\n> Are these two settings mutually exclusive?\r\n>\r\n> If I set ignore permissions on a folder on one machine, do I have to set it on all machines?\r\n>\r\n> It would be nice if I could leave permissions not ignored on the Linux box, so that permissions would be propagated correctly on other platforms that support permissions.\r\n>\r\n> Apologies if I’m missing something obvious.\r\n>\r\n> Thank you once again for this beautiful and immensely useful program.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis turns out to look very much like our mtime faking doens't work and some debugging ensues.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5777/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
