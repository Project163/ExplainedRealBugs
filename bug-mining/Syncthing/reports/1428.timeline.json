I had a file in one of my folders with the filename `�X!` (don't ask me how, I don't know either) which is apparently invalid utf-8 and causes glob to panic for some patterns. I noticed `Match()` in `ignore.go` gets called with the same file multiple times and the instance originating from [here](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/45beb28fa5b051d14a10f102a05ec46d36ecaa75/lib/model/folder.go#L994C2-L994C13) -> [here](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/45beb28fa5b051d14a10f102a05ec46d36ecaa75/lib/fs/basicfs_watch.go#L45C28-L45C38) leads to a panic.\r\n\r\nShould `Matcher.Match()` check for valid utf8 before proceeding? Adding a check there fixes the issue, but I feel like the file should have been filtered out before it gets to that stage, maybe in https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/45beb28fa5b051d14a10f102a05ec46d36ecaa75/lib/fs/basicfs_watch.go#L40\r\n\r\nSide note, method names in a lot of places are very confusing - many functions imply their parameters are dirs but are called with dir *and* file paths, like [this](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/45beb28fa5b051d14a10f102a05ec46d36ecaa75/lib/fs/basicfs_watch.go#L45C28-L45C38), ","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1912017644/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kylosus","id":33132401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTMyNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33132401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylosus","html_url":"https://github.com/kylosus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylosus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylosus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylosus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylosus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylosus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylosus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylosus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylosus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylosus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1912079467","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9369#issuecomment-1912079467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9369","id":1912079467,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAOCAEs5x-ARr","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-26T13:35:14Z","updated_at":"2024-01-26T13:35:23Z","body":"Nice catch.

That was a very good check I did. First it validates utf-8 (https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/main/lib/scanner/walk.go#L279) then it normlizes inside `handleItem` (after ignoring).
