Whatever it is, it's obviously racy too.\r\n\r\nI don't know *anything* about go or the Syncthing codebase, but if one of the devs could tell me how to do some kind of print debugging I can look deeper. I've tried inserting `fmt.print` and `log.Printf` calls in `removeAll` but see nothing printed in the output.
