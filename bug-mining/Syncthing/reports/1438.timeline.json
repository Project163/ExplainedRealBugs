Purpose\r\n\r\nAdds a new metric `syncthing_connections_active` which equals to the amount of active connections per device.\r\n\r\nFixes #9527 \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe the purpose of this change. If there is an existing issue that is\r\nresolved by this pull request, ensure that the commit subject is on the form\r\n`Some short description (fixes #1234)` where 1234 is the issue number.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI've manually tested it by running syncthing with these changes locally and examining the returned metrics from `/metrics`.\r\nI've done the following things:\r\n- Connect & disconnect a device\r\n- Increase & decrease the number of connections and verify that the value of the metric matches with the amount displayed in the GUI.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/syncthing/docs/blob/main/includes/metrics-list.rst needs to be regenerated with
