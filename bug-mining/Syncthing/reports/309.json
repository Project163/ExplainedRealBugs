It should be only activateable when \"Folder Master\" is already activated, else it makes no sense, as the deleted file will be synced back immediately. This would result in some kind of one way sync from phone to pc.\n\nThe target is to\n- Sync camera folder from phone to pc (<b>given</b> base functionality of syncthing)\n- Delete unneeded subfolders on the pc but do not sync these changes to the mobile-phone (<b>given</b> by activation of \"Folder Master\" on the phone)\n- Be able to clean up phones images without delete them on the pc (this is the <b>missing feature</b> which in addition to \"Folder Master\" should be as easy as stopping the phone's syncthing from pushing the file delete to the pc)\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1254/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
