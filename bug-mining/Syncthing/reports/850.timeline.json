have the same issue and spent quite a bit of time debugging until I found the cause. The problem/bug is in the order of execution in which asynchronous events are fired and executed (timing). I'm not sure why it happens on some machines but not others. In my case it started when my version tree got big (> 5000 versions).\r\n\r\nHere's the run down:\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks on the *Versions* button, [`$scope.restoreVersions.show`](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/v0.14.48/gui/default/syncthing/core/syncthingController.js#L1852) is invoked and performs the following:\r\n\r\n1. Show the ['#restoreVersions'](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/v0.14.48/gui/default/syncthing/core/syncthingController.js#L1857) modal/dialog box.\r\n2. Perform HTTP Get request to fetch the versions.\r\n\t2a. When the version `data` is returned assign it to [`$scope.restoreVersions.versions = data;`](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/v0.14.48/gui/default/syncthing/core/syncthingController.js#L1873)\r\n\t2b. Setting `$scope.restoreVersions.versions = data;` triggers an Angular event to add `#restoreTree` to the DOM: [here](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/v0.14.48/gui/default/syncthing/folder/restoreVersionsModalView.html#L4)\r\n3. When the top 2 promises are resolved:\r\n\t3a. Initialize the tree [`$(\"#restoreTree\").fancytree({})`](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/v0.14.48/gui/default/syncthing/core/syncthingController.js#L1882)\r\n\t3b. Initialize the filters and other stuff.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that sometimes **3a** is being executed before **2b**. In other words the initialization of `#restoreTree` node is called before Angular event is fired to add `#restoreTree` node to the DOM.\r\n\r\nThe right fix is to wait until Angular event **2b** is fired and completed before performing **3**.\r\nA quick fix/test/hack is to replace the line [here](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/v0.14.48/gui/default/syncthing/core/syncthingController.js#L1876) with the following code to essentially wait until `#restoreTree` is added to the DOM before initializing it:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar waitForRestoreTree = $q.defer();\r\nvar waitTimer = setInterval( ()=>{\r\n    if ($(\"#restoreTree\").length){\r\n        clearInterval(waitTimer);\r\n\twaitForRestoreTree.resolve();\r\n    }     \r\n}, 100);\r\n\r\n$q.all([dataReceived, modalShown.promise, waitForRestoreTree.promise]).then(function() {\r\n...\r\n```\r\n@rkfg @AudriusButkevicius : This bug is very difficult to replicate since the order of execution in which asynchronous promises and events are not guaranteed to always occur in the same order. Nevertheless, this bug is a legitimate issue and should be re-opened.
