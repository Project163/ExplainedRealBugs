And according to international laws that I'm aware of, you can not hold copyright for things you have not yet authored (well, to be really fair, published). That's exactly why if you published a book in 2002 and then rewrote a chapter for second reprint in 2010, you should put `©2002, 2010` in your copyright notice: you hold copyright for most of the text since 2002, but there are parts of the text that were not published before 2010, and for those you only hold copyright since 2010.\r\n\r\nIn software, it is common to keep developing throught years, and that produces constructs like `©2002-2010, 2012, 2015-2018` (this one would mean there was active development since 2002 till 2010, then there wasn't a single line of code written in 2011, some bugfixes in 2012, then the piece of software became abandoned until someone picked up development in 2015 and published new version at least once a year ever since, with the most current version published in 2018).\r\n\r\nNow, for our 1.0.1 release we have `©2014-2017` which would be correct only if no new code had been added since 2017 (and judging by commit history it is plainly false). Even worse, we give false copyright notices for our dependencies: the line `The Go Programming Language, Copyright © 2012 The Go Authors.` would hold truth only if we used version 1 of go, but I don't think syncthing would even compile on that.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/468885562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nekr0z","id":1515080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1515080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z","html_url":"https://github.com/nekr0z","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/468892167","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5569#issuecomment-468892167","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5569","id":468892167,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODg5MjE2Nw==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-02T06:43:45Z","updated_at":"2019-03-02T06:52:49Z","body":"We should update the range to 2019 for us, to be clear and correct, because we already have a range and it looks nice to have the current year in it. We can probably view the range as a summary of all the individual components, as files are created with new copyright dates etc... Otherwise it seems copyright is typically from the date of first publication and [doesn't need updating](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2390230/do-copyright-dates-need-to-be-updated). This is how we do it per source files as well.\r\n\r\nAs for all contributing software components, when I added the notes I took them from the corresponding license files or similar. For Go, that [currently](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/LICENSE) says\r\n\r\n```\r\nCopyright (c) 2009 The Go Authors. All rights reserved.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last commit on that file changed it from 2012 which is what it was when I copied it... So I don't think it's anything wrong with how we have it now, other than we should change it to 2009 really, nor obvious in any way that we need to try to keep the years up to date. Which is also a fools errand... And they clearly subscribe to the idea of \"date of first publication\".\r\n\r\nThe list is probably out of date though and could use an update from our current dependencies, whenever someone goes in there for an update.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/468892167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/468919341","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5569#issuecomment-468919341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5569","id":468919341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODkxOTM0MQ==","user":{"login":"nekr0z","id":1515080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1515080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z","html_url":"https://github.com/nekr0z","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nekr0z/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-02T13:11:38Z","updated_at":"2019-03-02T13:11:38Z","body":"I'm looking at go.mod in current master...
