fixes #5286 by adding security options to Syncthing systemd service files.\r\n\r\nSee the related pull request for the relay service options, for the rationale on the choice of options : https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/pull/5350#pullrequestreview-182004704\r\n\r\nIn summary :\r\n* we want to reduce the scope of what the executable can do, because syncthing will likely run on public facing IP, so is a target for attack\r\n* we want to restrict capabilities, but not overdo it because the service will not run as root anyway\r\n* we can not be as restrictive as with the relay service because its uses, and particularly the paths it will read/write to are not predictible\r\n\r\nCompared to the relay hardening options:\r\n* we use `ProtectSystem=full` instead of the more restrictive `ReadOnlyPaths=/  ReadWritePaths=/var/lib/syncthing-relaysrv` because we don't know where syncthing may need to write\r\n* we can not use `ProtectHome=true`, because syncthing may need to read/write files in `/home`\r\n* we can not use `PrivateDevices=true` either, because otherwise systemd throws this error:\r\n```\r\nsyncthing.service: Failed to drop capabilities: Operation not permitted\r\nsyncthing.service: Failed at step CAPABILITIES spawning /usr/bin/syncthing: Operation not permitted\r\n```\r\nI am not 100% sure, but I presume this is because the systemd user process does not have the required capabilities to setup the `/dev` mount namespace.\r\n\r\nI have tested it in the following configurations:\r\n* `syncthing.service`: Ubuntu 18.04, Syncthing 0.14.53\r\n* `syncthing@.service`: Arch Linux, Syncthing 0.14.52\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2012498575,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjAxMjQ5ODU3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2012498575","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-07T13:58:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2012498730,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwMTI0OTg3MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2012498730","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"132789785d1bddf750b81a7ef86b9b54055bffc1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/132789785d1bddf750b81a7ef86b9b54055bffc1","created_at":"2018-12-07T13:58:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2018061910,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDIwMTgwNjE5MTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2018061910","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-11T09:00:27Z","milestone":{"title":"v0.14.55"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2018065256,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MjAxODA2NTI1Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2018065256","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{

issue:\r\n\r\n> the kernel I am using seems not to support seccomp\r\n\r\nA solution for me was to comment out these lines in the unit:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# SystemCallArchitectures=native\r\n# MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem is, as you can guess from my version information, I cannot update the kernel to support these options, as the machine is a OpenVZ VPS and I have no control on the hypervisor.\r\n\r\nRelates to #5286 \r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v1.0.0\r\nOS Version: Ubuntu 16.04 / Kernel
