No, if the files were all previously gone, and they are suddenly there again, then they are new files.\n\n@AudriusButkevicius It's probably a good idea. Maybe containing the expected folder ID, and created under the same circumstances as we now create the directory (i.e. missing and no files in the index, so it's safe). If it's missing or the ID is different than expected, we get suspicious and stop the folder.\n\nThis will break the use case of having the same disk path exposed as multiple folders, for whatever reason.
