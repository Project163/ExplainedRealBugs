What happened?\n\nWhen you go to create a new folder and use `~` as a shortcut for your home directory, autocomplete stops working.\n\nHere's what it looks like with `~` (there is no autocomplete):\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/557ab5bf-7948-44c0-a991-d047826b593d)\n\nAnd with `/home/marcus` (real path of my home directory):\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da06aed5-b76d-49f4-a686-b2b7422cdb98)\n\nThis behavior (paired with the log output) is strange, as calling the REST API directly through curl with tildes behaves correctly and lists everything in my home directory.\n\n### Syncthing version\n\nv1.29.3\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\n(Arch, with all optional repositories
