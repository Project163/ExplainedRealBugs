just looked at the code and i think the behaviour @uok suggested is not that hard to implement. We could add a boolean to the archive function that tells us if it's a delete or not. \n`Archive(filePath string, delete bool)` instead of just `Archive(filePath string)` \n(or we make a separate function that is called on deletes)\n\nIf a file with a pretty old modification time gets modified we still instantly delete the version which could also be bad. \n\nAnother Idea which keeps modification time as timestamp in most cases but does not instantly delete stuff would be something like this:\n\nmodification time > 0.5_maximumAge => use 0.5_maximumAge to show that it's a really old file but we still keep the file for a while\nmodification time < 0.5*maximumAge => use modification time\n\nI don't really know what the best way to solve it will be, I think I like the \"0.5*maximumAge\" most because it will never instantly delete versions (but it could cause some confusions with the date) and is still easy to implement.\n\nAs soon as it's decided what to do I could work on that and make a pull request if you like
