\r\n[Link to line of code](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/main/cmd/stdiscosrv/apisrv.go#L139)\r\nThis result to a `nil` IP; i.e. `tcp://<nil>:22000` when `listenAddress = tcp://0.0.0.0:22000 | tcp://:22000`\r\n\r\n## What is expected\r\nWe should parse `X-Forwarded-For` by splitting the string by commas and taking the originating client IP (the leftmost value)\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nA simple example to replicate this entails running Discovery with HTTP, use Nginx as a reverse proxy and hardcode (as an example) a list of IPs in the `X-Forwarded-For` header.  \r\n    1. Send an Announcement with `tcp://0.0.0.0:<some-port>`\r\n    2. Query the DeviceID\r\n    3. Observe the returned IP Address is `tcp://<nil>:<some-port>`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9189/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
