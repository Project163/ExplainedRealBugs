One directory contains text files where I keep notes. Opening such a file in Emacs for editing results in the creation of broken symbolic links of the form\n\n.#filename -> user@hostname.PID:somenumber\n\n(where the placeholders contain real, reasonable values).  I cannot delete these files, and this is annoying since it a) produces occasional errors in the web GUI of the form \"Folder \"Folder_name\" isn't making progress - check logs for possible root cause. Pausing puller for 1m0s\" and b) because it keeps the web GUI from showing the directories as 100% synced. The files I edited are synced, though.\n\nStarting syncthing with STTRACE=files,scanner produced a line of output which may be relevant:\n\n2014/12/02 21:09:17.536475 blockqueue.go:52: DEBUG: open: open /home/XXX/.../.syncthing..#GX53-LED-Lampen.txt: no such file or directory\n\nEvery time I delete such a file on one of the nodes it will come back the next time the directory in synced (every ~1m at the moment), and the above error appears when the file is \"undeleted\". The only remedy is to open several terminals on all machines simultaneously and delete the file on all connected nodes in rapid succession.\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1071/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
