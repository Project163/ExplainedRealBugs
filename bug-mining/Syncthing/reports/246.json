And then it get stuck again, after syncing few small files on one huge file that needs about a day or more for it to be synced, because it's huge.\n\nIf there was an option to sort the sync queue by size, it would get rid of all small files in few hours and whole thing would start working much more smooth, as there wouldn't be hundreds of thousands of files in the queue, which makes syncthing very laggy and unresponsive, thus whole sync process would be incredibly more fast and effective.\n","closed_by":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
