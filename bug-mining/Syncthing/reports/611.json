So I add the following to my ignore list:\n`/.config/syncthing`\n\nHowever, this results in the following warning on start:\n\n```\nMai 25 12:53:08 book syncthing[28921]: [6EVKI] WARNING: Some protected files may be overwritten and cause issues. See http://docs.syncthing.net/users/config.html#syncing-configuration-files f\nor more information. The at risk files are: /home/hashworks/.config/syncthing/index-v0.13.0.db, /home/hashworks/.config/syncthing/config.xml, /home/hashworks/.config/syncthing/cert.pem, /home\n/hashworks/.config/syncthing/key.pem\n```\n\nWhen I change the ignore list entry to the following the warning won't occur after a restart.\n`.config/syncthing`\n### What I expect\n\nThe warning shouldn't occur when I'm syncing `~` and I ignored `/.config/syncthing`, just as with `.config/syncthing`.\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Sync your home directory\n2. Watch the configuration sync warning appear\n3. Stop syncthing\n4. Add `.config/syncthing` to your ignore list\n5. Start syncthing\n6. Make sure the configuration sync warning doesn't appear\n7. Stop syncthing\n8. Append `.config/syncthing` with `/`\n9. Start syncthing\n10. Watch the configuration sync warning appear\n### Additonal\n\nI haven't testet if the configuration files actually get synced with `/.config/syncthing`, they won't with `.config/syncthing`. Could be that only the configuration sync check is missing a rule.\nEdit: I've testet the `/.config/syncthing` entry, as I expected the rule works as it should, the folder isn't getting synced. It's just the warning message that is missing a rule for that case.\n### Version Information\n\nSyncthing Version: v0.13.2\nOS Version: Archlinux\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3183/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3183/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
