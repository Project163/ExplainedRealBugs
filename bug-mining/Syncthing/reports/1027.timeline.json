If there are many devices (think hundreds or thousands) this can become a large multiplier on the database size.\r\n\r\nWe could instead use an intermediary index and a reference counter. That is, instead of todays\r\n\r\n```\r\n(KeyTypeDevice, device, folder, filename) -> marshalled FileInfo\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe could do\r\n\r\n```\r\n(KeyTypeDevice, device, folder, filename) -> hash of marshalled FileInfo\r\n(KeyTypeHashedFileInfo, hash of marshalled FileInfo) -> (refcounter, marshalled FileInfo)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen doing inserts we hash the marshalled FileInfo and store that in place of the marshalled FileInfo. We then look up the item corresponding to that hash and either write `(1, marshalled FileInfo)` or bump the counter if it already exists.\r\n\r\nWhen overwriting a FileInfo we need to do the lookup and decrease the counter for the old value, potentially deleting the actual FileInfo when the counter reaches zero.\r\n\r\n(We only *delete* FileInfos when dropping a folder, which can be special cased.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5047/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4242230048,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQyNDIyMzAwNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4242230048","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-24T07:02:39Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4242230053,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50NDI0MjIzMDA1Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4242230053","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-24T07:02:39Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
