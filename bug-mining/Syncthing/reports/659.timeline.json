looking at this, a couple of thoughts come up:\n- This is probably significantly less likely to impact people using file change notifications on the receiving system because syncthing-inotify (or whatever other tool) is likely to notify Syncthing of the new file pretty quickly (much smaller race window).\n- Fixing this would require adding a check on the receiving end that the destination file doesn't already exist.  Ideally, that check should happen just before we rename the temporary file into place after downloading everything.  Such a check would slow down synchronization (you have to get a directory listing after each file downloaded.\n- Because of both of the above factors, if this does get implemented, it should be done in a way that it can be disabled at runtime, as some users won't ever have this issue (I would actually expect most people to not have this issue).\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/261525693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Ferroin","id":905151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/905151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin","html_url":"https://github.com/Ferroin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/261548996","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3742#issuecomment-261548996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3742","id":261548996,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTU0ODk5Ng==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-18T14:47:52Z","updated_at":"2016-11-18T14:47:52Z","body":"I don't think it needs to be that bad.
