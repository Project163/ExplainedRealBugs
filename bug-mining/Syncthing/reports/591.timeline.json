\n@AudriusButkevicius \nHey, it happened again.\nSo, here's the configuration, and I'm typing this from the culprit system.\nSo our project structure starts at the folder C:\\Users<user>\\Documents<root>\nThe culprit share, let's call it project \"cartoons\", is supposed to be at C:\\Users<user>\\Documents<root>\\Projects\\cartoons\\\nA nested structure makes sense for us because it keeps things organized, and allows us to keep things segmented between our team members, for instance, you don't want someone working on project 1 to have the files from project 2. So, we use nested shares, we're usually just very careful about it. It works for us.\n\nThe problem arises when you have someone who needs to have multiple shares, say... a project share, as well as their own personal share space. This is when file organizational skills are important. What happened this time is that we created a new share ABOVE an existing share.\n\nThe culprit system's \"cartoons\" share is at C:\\Users<user>\\\nWhere it is supposed to be at C:\\Users<user>\\Documents<root>\\Projects\\cartoons\\\nAgain, the root share is at C:\\Users<user>\\Documents<root>\n\nThis resulted in the entire user folder going inside the Cartoon folder. Since the user folder contains the root, the root went inside there, and the cartoons folder is inside the root so cartoons got made inside there, which contains root, and so on and so forth. Hence, infinite loop. It was probably created by accident, or Syncthing moved the share somehow (which I doubt). Either way, I don't remember there being a warning.\n\nSo yeah, I hope this helped. If you need anything else from me, please let me know.

I'm stuck as fuck. Maybe I'll remove and re-add the folder one day - not sure if this is possible it might be caused on my fried Marlene's computer because I dicked around on that in order to *create* the
