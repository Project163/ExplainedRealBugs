like a similar problem I encountered. Syncing from Linux to Linux where one PC is `send&receive` and the other one is `receive-only`. Both are using the `SyncOwnership` folder config.\r\n\r\nEvery time I revert the local changes on the receiving PC nearly all files pop up again as local changes.\r\n\r\nMaybe that's because of this logic:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc unixOwnershipEqual(a, b *UnixData) bool {\r\n\tif a == nil && b == nil {\r\n\t\treturn true\r\n\t}\r\n\tif a == nil || b == nil {\r\n\t\treturn false\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn a.UID == b.UID && a.GID == b.GID && a.OwnerName == b.OwnerName && a.GroupName == b.GroupName\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my case the receiver hasn't the same users as it is just a server and it would be sufficient for me if it just stores the `UID` and the `GID`.\r\n\r\nThe output of `syncthing cli debug file SHARE FILEPATH` seems to support this:\r\n\r\nSender:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"unix\": {\r\n    \"gid\": 1234,\r\n    \"groupName\": \"sven\",\r\n    \"ownerName\": \"sven\",\r\n    \"uid\": 1234\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nReceiver:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"unix\": {\r\n    \"gid\": 1234,\r\n    \"groupName\": \"\",\r\n    \"ownerName\": \"\",\r\n    \"uid\": 1234\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause the `ownerName` and `groupName` can't be synchronized the current behavior led to an endless sync loop especially when `receive-only` is set to `send&receive`.\r\n\r\nA proposed fix would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn a.UID == b.UID && a.GID == b.GID\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould this be ok?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1870446365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sven","id":89189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5MTg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven","html_url":"https://github.com/sven","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sven/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1870584783","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9039#issuecomment-1870584783","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9039","id":1870584783,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAOCAEs5vftvP","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-27T19:51:18Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T19:51:18Z","body":"I

Purpose\r\n\r\nIf syncOwnership is enabled and the remote uses for example a dockerized Syncthing it can't fetch the ownername and groupname of the local instance.

I think I'm having similar issues to backup Android `/sdcard` to Linux backup drive (ext4).\r\n\r\n+ Android: 1.27.6 from F-droid, root enabled/granted\r\nSend Only, Send Ownership, Send Extended Attr's.\r\n\r\n+ Linux: 1.27.9 from syncthing repo\r\nReceive Only, Ignore permissions, Sync Ownership, Sync Extended Attr's\r\nRunning as root systemd service with:\r\n`# /etc/systemd/system/syncthing@root.service.d/override.conf`\r\n`[Service]`\r\n`AmbientCapabilities=CAP_CHOWN CAP_FOWNER`\r\n\r\nAll the data is synced fine but none of the permissions or ownerships are (not sure if Android uses extended attr's).  On the Linux backup, it shows \"Local additions\" and the \"Revert Local Changes\" button appears to work but, within a few seconds, goes back to \"Local additions\".\r\n\r\nThis patch would resolve this right? but it's still Unverified/not committed?  Anything I can do to fix my instances?  I found that if I manually use chown/chmod on the Linux backup data, then it becomes synced and number of \"Locally Changed Items\" decreases.  Thx","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/2211983147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"scarlion1","id":2446600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDY2MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2446600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarlion1","html_url":"https://github.com/scarlion1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarlion1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarlion1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarlion1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarlion1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarlion1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarlion1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarlion1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarlion1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarlion1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17194487218,"node_id":"LE_lADOAOCAEs5ucIN_zwAAAAQA3w2y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/17194487218","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-09T18:54:31Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17194487353,"node_id":"LOE_lADOAOCAEs5ucIN_zwAAAAQA3w45","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/17194487353","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-09T18:54:32Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
