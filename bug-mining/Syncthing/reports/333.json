I have 3 different computers running either Windows 7 or 8.  It's the same for all three.  I wouldn't really care except I have separate instances running for different users on the same machine and it's my understanding that they can both work only if IPv6 local discovery is working.  In addition, UPnP is also not working.  The two may be related.  See my log output below.\n\n```\n[monitor] 2015/05/15 13:37:07.362448 monitor.go:63: INFO: Log output saved to file \"C:\\Users\\chris\\AppData\\Local\\Syncthing\\syncthing.log\"\n[monitor] 2015/05/15 13:37:07.363448 monitor.go:94: INFO: Starting syncthing\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:07.935480 main.go:466: INFO: syncthing v0.11.5 (go1.4.2 windows-amd64 default) unknown-user@syncthing-builder 2015-05-15 08:46:47 UTC\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:07.936481 main.go:467: INFO: My ID: ********\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:07.940481 main.go:740: INFO: Database block cache capacity 64499 KiB\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:08.265499 main.go:795: INFO: Starting web GUI on http://127.0.0.1:8384/\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:08.949538 main.go:870: INFO: Starting local discovery announcements\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:08.962539 discover.go:120: DEBUG: discover: Start local v6: listen udp6 ff32::5222: setsockopt: not supported by windows\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:08.962539 discover.go:131: INFO: Local discovery over IPv6 unavailable\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:08.962539 main.go:875: INFO: Starting global discovery announcements\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:09.006542 discover.go:348: DEBUG: discover: Received local announcement from 192.168.21.11:21025 for ********\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:09.011542 main.go:646: OK: Ready to synchronize **** (read-write)\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:09.011542 main.go:646: OK: Ready to synchronize **** (read-write)\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:09.011542 main.go:646: OK: Ready to synchronize **** (read-write)\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:09.011542 main.go:662: INFO: Device ******** is \"VELOCITY\" at [dynamic]\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:09.011542 main.go:662: INFO: Device ******** is \"CHRIS-MOBILE\" at [dynamic]\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:09.011542 main.go:662: INFO: Device ******** is \"HIPPO-CHRISTINE\" at [dynamic]\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:09.011542 main.go:662: INFO: Device ******** is \"HIPPO\" at [dynamic]\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:09.012542 main.go:662: INFO: Device ******** is \"ROGER\" at [dynamic]\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:09.012542 main.go:662: INFO: Device ******** is \"ROGER-CHRISTINE\" at [dynamic]\n[455QB] 2015/05/15 13:37:09.016542 client_udp.go:106: DEBUG: discover udp6://announce-v6.syncthing.net:22026: broadcast resolve: GetAddrInfoW: No such host is known.;
