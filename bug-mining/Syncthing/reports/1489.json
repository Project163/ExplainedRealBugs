I know that this is not recommended, but I have multiple users on both machines and I wand to run just one instance of ST. It works as expected. \r\n\r\nHowever, I noticed full rescans every 10-15 seconds. A large number of files is briefly shown as out-of-sync in the web interface, the same ones again and again.\r\n\r\nFinally I found that all those files had group id 1000, which had different names on the two machines, and one group name didn't even exist on the other machine at all. After changing the groups to match, these rescans stopped.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this situation isn't being handled well right now. There were no helpful log messages.\n\n### Syncthing version\n\nv1.28.0\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nLinux arm64\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9879/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
