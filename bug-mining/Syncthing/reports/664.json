For that, I added log statements around the following code block in main.go:\r\n```\r\nsha256.SelectAlgo()\r\nsha256.Report()\r\nperfWithWeakHash := cpuBench(3, 150*time.Millisecond, true)\r\nl.Infof(\"Hashing performance with weak hash is %.02f MB/s\", perfWithWeakHash)\r\nperfWithoutWeakHash := cpuBench(3, 150*time.Millisecond, false)\r\nl.Infof(\"Hashing performance without weak hash is %.02f MB/s\", perfWithoutWeakHash)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to the logs, this takes more than 3 seconds to run on my Nexus 5. When I commented these lines out and hardcoded `weakhash.Enabled = false`, the app was available almost instantly.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see, there is no way to disable the benchmarks via parameters or config. So there are a few options:\r\n- add an option, to disable all benchmarks (via environment variable or parameter)\r\n- run the benchmark only on first start, and cache the result as long as the CPU doesn't change (but that will still slow down the initial start)\r\n- optimize the benchmark, so that it runs much faster\r\n- run the benchmark asynchronously, so it doesn't block startup (but that would still be a waste of cpu/battery)\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.32\r\nOS Version: Android 6\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4348/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
