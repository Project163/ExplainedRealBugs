have a bunch of folders synching among a few devices. Two of these devices are NAS devices (Synology DS214play). Most folders (smaller ones) gets synchronized just fine among all devices. But there are a few larger folders that never get fully synchronized with the NAS devices.\n\nFor instance, I have a pictures folder with 57856 items and 118 GiB. One of the NAS devices has \"only\" 50048 and 116 GiB in this same folder. It's not stuck, as new files inside the first-level subfolders starting with lower letters (like A, B, C, ...) gets synched faster, but new files inside first-level subfolders starting with letters like R, S, T, ... may take a long time to get synced, if ever. \n\nI guess the NAS devices are slow and they start working on the folders tree in alphabetic order, but they never get to the end and gets restarted for some reason.\n\nThe same thing happens in another folder with videos, which has only 931 items, but 87 GiB. So I guess the size is the problem, not the amount of files.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1825/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":341894714,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM0MTg5NDcxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/341894714","actor":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"93ad803073e28eff0b8d7b5c4251c679a32091ab","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AudriusButkevicius/syncthing/commits/93ad803073e28eff0b8d7b5c4251c679a32091ab","created_at":"2015-06-27T11:34:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":342186437,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzQyMTg2NDM3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/342186437","actor":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"93ad803073e28eff0b8d7b5c4251c679a32091ab","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/93ad803073e28eff0b8d7b5c4251c679a32091ab","created_at":"2015-06-28T05:45:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":342186438,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM0MjE4NjQzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/342186438","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ca21db948173ffd3b11f0f8ec70e82c481817146","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/ca21db948173ffd3b11f0f8ec70e82c481817146","created_at":"2015-06-28T05:45:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/116329453","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1751#issuecomment-116329453","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1751","id":116329453,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExNjMyOTQ1Mw==","user":{"login":"jangrewe","id":126137,"node_id":"MDQ6
