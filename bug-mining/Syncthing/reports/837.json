noticed that Syncthing 0.14.51 crashes on my Arch Linux system with the following error:   \r\n```\r\npanic: interface conversion: interface {} is map[string]string, not map[string]interface {}\r\n```\r\nFull error log: http://paste.opensuse.org/96753389\r\n\r\nHere's how I could reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Copy https://github.com/Martchus/syncthingtray/blob/master/connector/testfiles/testconfig/config.xml to an empty directory\r\n2. Start `syncthing -gui-address=http://localhost:4001 -gui-apikey=syncthingtestinstance -home=/dir/with/config -no-browser -verbose`\r\n\r\nFurther notes:\r\n* The problem only occurs if device `MMGUI6U-WUEZQCP-XZZ6VYB-LCT4TVC-ER2HAVX-QYT6X7D-S6ZSG2B-323KLQ7` is actually reachable in my local network.\r\n* This device in my local network has actually a different device ID than stated in the configuration file. That 'misconfiguration' comes from the fact that https://github.com/Martchus/syncthingtray/blob/master/connector/testfiles/testconfig/config.xml is really just intended for testing Syncthing Tray's code and no actual connection is supposed to happen.\r\n* I have another Syncthing instance running at the same time which is configured correctly and it can connect to the mentioned device in my local network.\r\n\r\nComments from @imsodin via IRC:\r\n> [23:50] \\<imsodin\\> Martchus: The log is pretty clear, looks like a straight forward bug. what's not straight forward is, that it is present since an eternity and you seem to be the first to observe it!?\r\n> [23:50] \\<imsodin\\> could you file it on github please\r\n> [00:06] \\<Martchus\\> to me 'panic: interface conversion: interface {} is map[string]string, not map[string]interface {}' mean litterally nothing - likely some (de)serialization code - but it doesn't point to a file or line of code\r\n> [00:13] \\<imsodin\\> the next block contains the info about which line in the code this originates.\r\n> [00:13] \\<imsodin\\> then I grep for \"DeviceRejected\" and see that the type in which it is logged is different from the type in the assertion -> boom\r\n> [00:14] \\<imsodin\\> i can reliably reproduce by starting a fresh instance with -verbose and by adding this device on a remote device. as soon as the \"invitation\" reaches here, it panics\r\n> [00:15] \\<imsodin\\> i suspect this did not surface due to suture handling the panics before","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5270/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
