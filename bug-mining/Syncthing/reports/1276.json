you delete an encrypted file in a receive-only folder, i.e. do that manually in the filesystem, that won't register in the UI. It will look like everything is ok.\r\n\r\nReason is that we have an ugly hack to satisfy two requirements:\r\n\r\n - Locally changed items from a receive-encrypted folder must never be sent to remotes.\r\n - Locally added items that are deleted again aren't a problem, thus shouldn't show as local changes in the web UI.\r\n\r\nThe ugly hack is to ignore all items that have the locally-changed flag set and are deleted. That's fine for actually spurious files, that were removed, but obviously not for files that should be there.\r\n\r\nPR incoming.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7715/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
