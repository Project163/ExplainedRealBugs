This is a problem in Windows when trying to edit those using the built-in Notepad, which until very recently had no support for other line endings than CRLF. Support for them has only been added in the very recent versions of Windows 10.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when opening those files in Notepad under older (<= 1809?) versions of Windows 10 or any other older version of Windows for that matter (including also the newest Windows Server 2019), the content of those files is displayed in a long single line. This makes it basically impossible to review and edit.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest that these files should automatically revert to CRLF line endings when Syncthing is being run under Windows.\r\n\r\nRef: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/extended-eol-in-notepad","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7115/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
