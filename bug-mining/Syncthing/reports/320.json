This would avoid worse problems caused when disk space reaches zero.\n\n(Now I see @Zillode 's comment in #1790 that there is no golang library for getting free disk space. Any news or other thoughts on that matter?) \n\nClosed issues related to out-of-space errors: \nhttps://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/302\nhttps://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1790\n","closed_by":{"login":"Zillode","id":14169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode","html_url":"https://github.com/Zillode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2057/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
