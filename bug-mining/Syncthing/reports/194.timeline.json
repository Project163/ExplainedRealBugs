are 0.10.20.\nHmm, by the way on the other side \"fastboot\" is a regular file and its date is Jan 1, 1970. So it looks to me like in one of the previous versions symlinks were handled wrong and thus a regular file was created with zero timestamp and default permissions (but with contents of the symlink target file), which in turn was synced back and corrupted the original file. The same happens with another file, the scheme is a bit tricky though.\nSide A:\n~/bin/mpdel (the problematic file with constantly resetting timestamp/acl)\n~/ownCloud/mplayer/mpdel -> ~/bin/mpdel (the symlink to the file above)\nBoth ~/bin and ~/ownCloud are synced with side B.\n\nSide B:\n~/bin/mpdel (the problematic file with constantly resetting timestamp/acl)\n~/ownCloud/mplayer/mpdel (a **regular** file with zero timestamp and default acl, probably was created long ago when symlinks weren't working)\n\nSo even when I change the acl/timestamp for ~/bin/mpdel on any side it gets rewritten via that symlink because Side A receives a regular file named \"~/ownCloud/mplayer/mpdel\" with broken attrs and puts them to the symlink target (~/bin/mpdel). I believe this should not happen, if one tries to sync a file over a symlink (on the other end) this should be ignored and an error should be reported. I may be wrong though. On a side note, I hope cyclic links are handled well enough because this may actually happen and not just as file -> file but with several hops in between.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/70634778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rkfg","id":184066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg","html_url":"https://github.com/rkfg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/70636350","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1276#issuecomment-70636350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1276","id":70636350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjM2MzUw","user":{"login":"rkfg","id":184066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg","html_url":"https://github.com/rkfg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-20T10:52:44Z","updated_at":"2015-01-20T10:52:44Z","body":"Weird.

to me like an inconsistency in the DB. I tried to create a symlink to some file on A, sync it to B, then replace the symlink with the file, changing its flags and mtime and after syncing it replaced the symlink on B. That was not the case from the very beginning of my issue, there were a symlink and a file living happily on both sides without preempting each other and that's possibly the root of the problem. I can't achieve the same behavior now, probably it could be only done via exploiting the old version bug. And answering your question regarding 0.10.7, probably yes, I've had all versions from the 0.10.x branch and they're always up to date. Can't say for sure from which version I migrated to 0.10.x though.\n\nLog of Side A: http://pastebin.com/7cxwN9Kd\nLog of Side B: http://pastebin.com/XEjGbANh\nPlease, save them locally as I set the expiration to 1 day. Tell me if I've redacted it too much and removed necessary data. To reproduce you can build an older version, sync some symlinks so the database state is pseudo-synced but actually there are plain files insted of symlinks on another side, then update the build to 0.10.20 and play with the files. Hopefully, it will behave alike.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/70643951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rkfg","id":184066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg","html_url":"https://github.com/rkfg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/70644291","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1276#issuecomment-70644291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1276","id":70644291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjQ0Mjkx","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-20T12:08:41Z","updated_at":"2015-01-20T12:08:41Z","body":"Yeah,

I can't say though which version to consider legacy enough. The first file that started having issues was \"naspower\" which I use to turn my NAS on (via WOL) and off (via SSH), it has two symlinks, nason and nasoff respectively. So one day it stopped working and I found that its +x attribute was reset. I changed it back just to find another day that it was reset once again. It happened in 2014 for sure, probably in December.\n\n> delete the index directory and let it rebuild the index.\n\nYeah, that should fix it. I, as a programmer myself, hate to delete problems irreversibly as they sometimes strike back. So while I have a stable reproducible error I prefer to investigate and fix it instead of getting rid of it the easy way. Looks like I did everything I could and researched it well enough so I'll backup the indexes and reset them.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/70645545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rkfg","id":184066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg","html_url":"https://github.com/rkfg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkfg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/70645765","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1276#issuecomment-70645765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1276","id":70645765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjQ1NzY1","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-20T12:22:50Z","updated_at":"2015-01-20T12:22:50Z","body":"Thanks,
