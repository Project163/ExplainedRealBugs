As far as I understand, blocks are all 128 kiB in size, except for the last one (which might be the only one too). https://discourse.syncthing.net/t/better-delta-sync-algorithm-like-rsync/984/14 seems like a reasonable implementation to determine splits in files by file content, not a fixed length. https://github.com/bup/bup for example uses such an algorithm to handle inserts in the middle of files better, check out bup-split.\n\nYou could still insist on having 128 kiB as maximum block size (though you seem to prefer this to be the \"average\" or \"typical\" size), then a splitting algorithm would simply split at the boundaries it finds or at 128 kiB, if no boundary was found since the last split. This might be necessary to prevent attacks on the splitting algo anyways.\n\nYour current version of splitting files into blocks only works well with append-heavy file changes, bup-split works also with inserts and prepends and you need to hash the file anyways.\n\nIt would be nice to at least have the option to add such a feature to the client later on by making the file size requirements of blocks a bit more relaxed.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/77905922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MarkusTeufelberger","id":950561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MDU2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/950561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusTeufelberger","html_url":"https://github.com/MarkusTeufelberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusTeufelberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusTeufelberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusTeufelberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusTeufelberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusTeufelberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusTeufelberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusTeufelberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusTeufelberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkusTeufelberger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/86200950","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1027#issuecomment-86200950","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1027","id":86200950,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MjAwOTUw","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-25T20:16:41Z","updated_at":"2015-03-25T20:16:41Z","body":"@MarkusTeufelberger
