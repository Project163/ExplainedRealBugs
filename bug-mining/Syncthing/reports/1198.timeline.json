Also, what happens if you created a folder with defaults and change the value of a default, are we going to have users expect the value on the folder to change too? I guess we'll have users in both camps and someone will always be left unhappy.\r\n\r\nI vote close as wont-fix, as this makes things ambiguous, and just leads to unhappy people just in different

Additionally, rescanning is only pointless if using inotify if you trust it to reliably catch everything, which at least on Linux it won't (if you have enough changes happening fast enough, events _can_ and _will_ be dropped), and you at minimum need to rescan on startup because you have no proof that nothing changed since you last ran.\r\n* As stupid as it sounds, a random pull order actually is near optimal for an initial sync situation too, provided you have a single source and multiple systems syncing from it and you have equal (or near equal) bandwidth between all nodes.

the XML format config, folders and devices have some settings as attributes and some as child elements. This is somewhat arbitrary, originally maybe based on what felt like \"important\" or \"small\" config settings perhaps. I suggest straightening this out by moving all attributes except `id` into elements. That is, a folder like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<folder id=\"test\" path=\"testdata\" type=\"readonly\" ignorePerms=\"false\" rescanIntervalS=\"600\" autoNormalize=\"true\"> \r\n    <filesystemType>basic</filesystemType>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould become:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<folder id=\"test\">\r\n    <filesystemType>basic</filesystemType>\r\n    <path>testdata</path>\r\n    <type>readonly</type>\r\n    <ignorePerms>false</ignorePerms>\r\n    ....\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Correspondingly for devices)\r\n\r\nWe would need to support reading the values as attributes as well as elements for a while. Wrappers who generate our config format would still be able to do so and we would understand the old format. \r\n\r\nWrappers who *read* our XML format would need updating, though the only reason for doing so I can think of immediately is to find out the API port and key, which would be unaffected by this. Other config manipulation should ideally happen through the API which is not affected by this. (Ideally the `tls` and `debugging` attributes on `gui` should also become elements, but I'm not super adamant on that change.)\r\n\r\nMaking this change supports solving #4224 nicer in the future, as we can then declare default objects with only elements in them, corresponding precisely to device and folder objects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6932/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-29T13:18:46Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T13:18:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7065","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7065/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7065/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7065/events","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7065","id":732303159,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MzIzMDMxNTk=","number":7065,"title":"ignorePerms

PR is still WIP because of the to-dos below, but it is usable as it is right now.\r\n\r\nThe branch lives on top of https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/pull/7127 (first three commits at the time of writing) - I would suggest looking at that first, however if you'd rather have one huge diff, it's available here :) \r\n\r\nThe defaults in proto are represented as normal `FolderConfiguration`/`DeviceConfiguration` messages. I added a new `ext.nodefault` proto extension/tag to mark fields which are not configurable (like the id). Those are used to ensure that they are at their zero value when committing a config change. Using the same type allows using it directly as a template for new folders/devices and means there's no duplication.\r\n\r\nThe defaults can be obtained and set through the rest api on `rest/config/defaults/folder` resp. `.../device` and that endpoint is used instead of the hardcoded values in the GUI (fixes #6068).\r\n\r\n### Changed defaults\r\n\r\nIf the defaults in the GUI did not match those in the config, I chose the GUI ones as those are the ones that were really in effect:\r\n\r\nFolder:\r\n - max conflicts: -1 -> 10\r\n - min disk free: nothing/unlimited -> 1%\r\n\r\n### To-do\r\n\r\n - [x] GUI to modify defaults. Plan is to reuse existing folder and device modals. (Required to really fix #4224).\r\n\r\n - [x] Port gui to untrusted.\r\n\r\noptional:\r\n\r\n  - [ ] Somehow handle versioning defaults. Currently you can set default versioning for new folders including parameters, but not default parameters for the different versioning types. Not sure whether that's really necessary and the GUI versioning code is a bit messy/verbose, so haven't looked into that yet.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI extended the test checking defaults and did some manual fiddling around with config and UI, which looked good (but was likely far from comprehensive).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7131/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7131/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4021307925,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQwMjEzMDc5MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4021307925","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d92f8a80c5a1f2213abfe9e7b389b4be7d1b8a05","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imsodin/syncthing/commits/d92f8a80c5a1f2213abfe9e7b389b4be7d1b8a05","created_at":"2020-11-20T15:03:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4292817686,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDI5MjgxNzY4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4292817686","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-04T20:10:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4292817792,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQyOTI4MTc3OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4292817792","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ffc14a77c67bc0e1f772d414f0ad834ada0af99f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/ffc14a77c67bc0e1f772d414f0ad834ada0af99f","created_at":"2021-02-04T20:10:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4292822338,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQyOTI4MjIzMzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4292822338","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c
