The error is: File picture1.jpg - permission denied while changing ctime of the file. Check file permissions, making sure the ovner of the syncthing process is allowed to write to the file\"\n\nIt's fine to have this info in the logs /Stdout too but the GUI should really reflect the error that syncthing are throwing and giving the user a chance to know what went wrong and why for him to solve the issues.\n\nAll other errors that affects the syncprocess should also be communicated to the user in a more user friendly way\" the user should really not go to the logs to find theese informations.

there, \nthis is a BUG REPORT, I'm using v0.10.23 on OSX Yosemite and v0.10.23 via the app on Cyanogenmod.\n\nI'm syncing files from OSX to the phone. As the phone kept flashing a warning message with \"Folder 'XYZ' isn't making any progress.\" \"... pausing puller for a minute (or something like that)\" after restarting syncthing / deleting and reinitializing the repository several times, I started looking if specific files were not transferred.\n\nAs it turns out, files cannot be transferred if they have a slash, \"/\", in their name. I tested it with a number of different files in number of different folders and this is reproducibly the cause. \n\nI had the same issue as well on files not containing a slash. Strangely it was possible to upload such a file to one directory, but not to another. Since I couldn't really pinpoint the problem I have a FEATURE REQUEST: In the given warning message, \"Folder 'XYZ' isn't making any progress. ...\", please add the name and path of the files that the puller is/was working on. This way one can at least do something with the files that are causing the issue.

finished (?) at least one file.\nthats not very much. \nlast synced file is cute, but i dont see why it has a place in the gui when other more meaningful data doesnt.\n\ni guess some of that information can be obtained through log files, but i hope its planned to move some  of the data like this into the gui\n\ni tried to search for a similar thread but didnt find anything, sorry if that

is stuck on one side. The other side is done. The unstuck side is master of a folder that has a red \"Override Changes\" button. I don't recall doing anything in the user interface or explicit control of syncthing to cause that button to appear.\n\nSo, the surface issue is how to get unstuck. Something like this has happened before and I got unstuck by clicking on the red button. I'm not clicking on it just yet in case we need to do any triaging.\n\nThe real issue, I think though, is why I can inadvertently get into such a weird state in the first place. There have been lots of issues of people getting stuck synchronization. I haven't seen all of them but the few that I've seen ended up with people doing some non-obvious workaround. For my case, I have to say it's a confusing problem with a non-intuitive workaround. Is there a bug with the synchronization protocol itself that makes such events unavoidable? Or is it a bug with the implementation of the protocol?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1693/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":301218811,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDMwMTIxODgxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/301218811","actor":{"login":"Zillode","id":14169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode","html_url":"https://github.com/Zillode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-05-10T18:09:33Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/100676269","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1437#issuecomment-100676269","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1437","id":100676269,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMDY3NjI2OQ==","user":{"login":"Zillode","id":14169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode","html_url":"https://github.com/Zillode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zillode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-10T18:14:06Z","updated_at":"2015-05-10T18:14:06Z","body":"2/3 are resolved:\n- Any reason why a folder was stopped. \"The folder isn't making progress.
