When connecting to a device via Tor hidden service I get this error (the actual service name has been replaced by xxxx):\n\n[UTXVT] 2016/05/20 16:05:38.235092 service.go:347: DEBUG: dial failed TF2HZQ3-RCHC6OG-IMQZ76H-RZ2AM5U-XUXXU5-UQ4SXXL-GHFELKL-2HW2IAC tcp://xxxx.onion lookup xxxx.onion on 127.0.1.1:53: no such host\n\nThe **all_proxy** variable is set as always equal to **socks5://127.0.0.1:9050**\n\nThe old post is [this one](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/feature-tor-support/2748/13)\n\nAny help will be appreciated.
