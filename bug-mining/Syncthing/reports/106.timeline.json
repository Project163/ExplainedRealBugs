I'm not super fond of the `ignores2` endpoint, but I see the point. How about just adding a field to the current output, something like `resolvedIgnores` or `parsedIgnores` or something that contains an array of the _actual_ loaded ignore patterns, i.e. with `#includes` followed and expanded etc. We could expose the patterns as regexps of course; with the note that they are butt ugly (since they're auto generated) and that it's theoretically possible we could switch to a matching backend that is not regexp based in the future...\n\nAn annoying detail is that the `.stversions` etc files are not in fact part of the loaded ignore patterns, but is hardcoded to be ignored in the scanner. We could move them to be default ignore patterns instead, but then we'll trigger using the ignore cache for all folders, increasing memory usage. I'm not sure how much of an issue that would be though.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/62278098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":190385690,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTkwMzg1Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/190385690","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"2449723a1c95ef375a9ff5fbae24cf702e817f85","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/2449723a1c95ef375a9ff5fbae24cf702e817f85","created_at":"2014-11-08T21:20:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/62279344","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/942#issuecomment-62279344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/942","id":62279344,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjc5MzQ0","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-08T21:22:28Z","updated_at":"2014-11-08T21:23:44Z","body":"^ That patch adds a `patterns` member with the compiled patterns in them. Two things though: the magic `.stwhatever` files are not included. The complete list is `.stfolder`, `.stignore` and `.stversions`, all at the top level. This doesn't change very often, so I'd go with just hardcoding it for the time being - it's no worse than hardcoding the syncthing API in there. Also, excluded items have a nonstandard `(?exclude)` marker in front of the regexp, because I couldn't be bothered to make a struct with a boolean to serialize etc. and it's a feature I kind of wish regexps would support anyway. :)\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"ignore\": [\n    \"// .stignore is a text file that helps you specify single files, paths and rules\",\n    \"// for exclusion during the
