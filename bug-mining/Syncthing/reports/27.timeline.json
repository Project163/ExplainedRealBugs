As nodes communicate they always accept higher versions of the index than the one they have, and this way work out what to sync (comparing to what is on the disk).\n\nNow when you change the path of the repo, that doesn't reset the counter for the repo, and therefore when the next scan happens, it says, \"oh okay, something has changed as the indexes don't match, lets increment the counter and advertise my new index to everyone\", and then all nodes receive the empty index with higher version, deleting everything, which you could say is a bug.\n\nBut then there is the reverse option of this:\n\nI have directory A with files `a`, `b`, `c` synced between nodes, now since I use some other method of transfer, I have a newer version of directory A (called B) with files `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` located somewhere else on my disk, I decided that I should instead point the syncthing repo from dir A to dir B... For it to be synced with all the nodes as that has the new file I've added....\nNow if we were to fix the above bug by resetting the version on repo path change, this would cause file `d` to be deleted locally.\n\nTherefore when changing repo path, the answer is to ask,`is this a newer version of the existing repo`, or `do you want to move the repo there`.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/52914789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/52929742","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/549#issuecomment-52929742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/549","id":52929742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTI5NzQy","user":{"login":"lb1a","id":896344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NjM0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/896344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lb1a","html_url":"https://github.com/lb1a","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lb1a/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lb1a/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lb1a/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lb1a/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lb1a/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lb1a/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lb1a/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lb1a/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lb1a/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-21T14:43:19Z","updated_at":"2014-08-21T14:43:19Z","body":"@AudriusButkevicius

syncthing has no notion of what the path to a repository has been historically. We know the files we have (or used to have) in the repo as tuples of {repository ID, path within repo}. So yeah, when you change the repo path, what syncthing sees is that there are suddenly no files.\n\nNote that you must actually create an empty repository path and change the config to point to it for this to happen. If you change the repo path to point to something that doesn't exist, syncthing will warn and complain.\n\nAs always, there are corner cases. What if you change the path to something that is not empty? That contains files that are different from the currently \"in sync\" versions?
