Peer A considers Server as untrusted. The folder is shared encrypted.\r\nPeer B also shares that same folder with Server. It also considers Server as untrusted.\r\n\r\nAfter updating, syncthing on Server says \"Folder \\<id> (\\<name>) is shared in trusted mode with untrusted device \\<Peer B>; unsharing\".\r\n\r\nDowngrading to 1.23.5 fixes it.
