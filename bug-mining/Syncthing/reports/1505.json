The majority of the file remains identical.\n\nOn v1, the change in change date would trigger syncthing to run through the file, and transfer only the changed parts over the network connection, while seemingly only limited by ssd speed and cpu for how long it takes to update the file.\n\nBut now, on v2, it seems to download the entire file every time, no matter how small the changes. This is a major issue since on bad internet connections, this can take hours every time. Is there a setting to adjust this behavior, or is this just v2 being different?\n\nedit: Possibly related to this  change?\n\nRolling hash detection of shifted data is no longer supported as this\neffectively never helped. Instead, scanning and syncing is faster and more\nefficient without it.\n\nPossible to add a feature toggle for this one?\n\n### Syncthing version\n\nv2.0.8\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nWindows arm64, Server: v2.0.7, Linux (64-bit Intel/AMD Container)\n\n### Browser version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n<img width=\"1746\" height=\"634\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a47aff40-8e13-4b60-a4dc-247edc9ab520\" />","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10388/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
