Chrome and forks do, but this is non-standard behavior. \r\n\r\nSee https://forum.syncthing.net/t/fixing-syncthing-favicons-in-firefox/15726 for description of cause and work around. \r\n\r\nI suggest that the initial favicon link not result in a 404, as noted by calmh at https://forum.syncthing.net/t/fixing-syncthing-favicons-in-firefox/15726/2. \r\n\r\nIf it is desirable to have the favicon change based on status, the favicon link can be updated as at present. However, changing the favicon after page load does not appear to be standard behavior, so many browsers may not display the change.
