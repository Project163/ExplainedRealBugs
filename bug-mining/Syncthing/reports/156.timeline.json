thought these counts represented the number of files and directories under the sync folder less any that are ignored.\n\nYet in the cases I have the count is lower than expected and I have come to not trust _syncthing_ to actually synchronise all the files and directories.   I have not been able to find a trace option to find out which files it is keeping in sync and which it is not.\n\nThe case I'm struggling with this weekend is a directory named _firmware_ under a directory named _linux_.  I am trying to synchronise the folder between two _ext3_ file systems.  The file systems have previously been synchronised many times by other means,\n\nLast weekend I had the _firmware_ directory as a distinct _syncthing_ folder and everything seemed to sync OK.  This weekend I decided to move up a level and use _syncthing_ to synchronise everything under _linux_.\n\nThe first step was to delete the old sync folder and then delete its .stfolder file by hand since it seems _syncthing_ doesn't.\n\nThe second step was to create a new sync folder up one directory level and set up an .stignore file to ignore everything except the _firmware_ subdirectory.\n\nAfter sharing the new _syncthing_ folder between the two machines the item count was 0 for both the global and local states.  Hmm ... I tried to 'provoke' _syncthing_ into make a new tally:\n- create a new file at one end\n\nThe new file was synced and the item count became 1.\n- touch a file at one end\n\nThe touched file was synced and the item count rose to 2.\n\nI renamed the _firmware_ directory at one end.  _syncthing_ deleted the _firmware_ directory at the other end and synced over the directory and its contents under the new name.  The item count rose to 142, which is what I always thought it should be.  Good.\n\nSo I renamed the directory back to _firmware_.  _syncthing_ deleted the renamed directory at the other end and synced over ... um ... just the 'new' and the 'touched' files.  The item count fell back to 2.  *\\* sigh *\\*  Not so good.\n\nNow I can actually see that it hasn't synced everything it should.  I just wonder how long it will be before it decides the correct thing to do is to delete the 140 files that now appear only at one end.\n\nI'd love to tar-ball this lot up and send it to you so you can see this for yourself.  I tried this myself and the problem just disappeared.\n\nThe previous occasion I saw this sort of thing was on different sync folder.  I saw something in the logs that both sides decided they knew there were 91 items but decided only 33 were to be synced.  There as no .stignore and _syncthing_ didn't see a problem with the apparent contradiction.  At least a sanity check might stop this problem going unnoticed by others.\n\nAny thoughts before I give up trying to use this altogether ?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/67764306","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1133#issuecomment-67764306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1133","id":67764306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NzY0MzA2","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-21T08:58:47Z","updated_at":"2014-12-21T09:00:14Z","body":"We could probably solve this by not overloading the Invalid bit and instead setting a specific Ignored bit, both on received ignored files and locally discovered ignored files...\n\nWe could also announce files with that bit set to indicate that we have them / have received info about them but have ignored them, but I'm not sure of the value.

Refactor ignore handling (...)\n\n```\nThis uses persistent Matcher objects that can reload their content and\nprovide a hash string that can be used to check if it's changed. The\ncache is local to each Matcher object instead of kept globally.\n```\n## Move ignore handling from index recv to puller (fixes #1133)\n\n```\nWith this change we accept updates for ignored files from other devices,\nand check the ignore patterns at pull time. When we detect that the\nignore patterns have changed we do a full check of files that we might\nnow need to
