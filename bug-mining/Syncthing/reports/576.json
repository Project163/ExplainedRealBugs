Things appear to be syncing, but the log is absolutely stuffed with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[PW634] 16:06:23 INFO: Puller (folder \"Music\", dir \"music\"): incompatible symlink entry; rescan with newer Syncthing on source\r\n[PW634] 16:06:23 INFO: Puller (folder \"Music\", dir \"music\"): incompatible symlink entry; rescan with newer Syncthing on source\r\n[PW634] 16:06:23 INFO: Puller (folder \"Music\", dir \"music\"): incompatible symlink entry; rescan with newer Syncthing on source\r\n[PW634] 16:06:23 INFO: Puller (folder \"Music\", dir \"music\"): incompatible symlink entry; rescan with newer Syncthing on source\r\n[PW634] 16:06:23 INFO: Puller (folder \"Music\", dir \"music\"): incompatible symlink entry; rescan with newer Syncthing on source\r\n[PW634] 16:06:23 INFO: Puller (folder \"Music\", dir \"music\"): incompatible symlink entry; rescan with newer Syncthing on source\r\n[PW634] 16:06:23 INFO: Puller (folder \"Music\", dir \"music\"): incompatible symlink entry; rescan with newer Syncthing on source\r\n[PW634] 16:06:23 INFO: Puller (folder \"Music\", dir \"music\"): incompatible symlink entry; rescan with newer Syncthing on source\r\n[PW634] 16:06:23 INFO: Puller (folder \"Music\", dir \"music\"): incompatible symlink entry; rescan with newer Syncthing on source\r\n[PW634] 16:06:23 INFO: Puller (folder \"Music\", dir \"music\"): incompatible symlink entry; rescan with newer Syncthing on source\r\n[PW634] 16:06:23 INFO: Puller (folder \"Music\", dir \"music\"): incompatible symlink entry; rescan with newer Syncthing on source\r\n[PW634] 16:06:23 INFO: Folder \"Music\" isn't making progress. Pausing puller for 1m0s.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the minute pause, another batch of errors appears. Oddly, the directory in question - which is itself a symlink to another directory called \"My Music\" in the same parent directory, for historical reasons - appears to be syncing OK in both directions.\r\n\r\nThe error indicates that it's running into the \"symlinks can't be synced between 0.14.14 and older versions\" problem, *except* that both devices are running 0.14.14 just fine. The errors only appear on the desktop client; the server shows nothing strange in the logs.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.14\r\nOS Version: Ubuntu 14.04 64-Bit\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
