It's got the hidden attribute on Windows, and starts with a . (which means the same thing on every other OS syncthing runs on).  Given that it's entirely created by Syncthing, that it can be pretty large, and that it's hidden (and therefore easy to forget), it's not unlikely that it will end up taking up space on the user's system that they may not be able to find.
