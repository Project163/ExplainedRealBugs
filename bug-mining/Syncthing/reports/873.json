This causes the user to assume the changes have been saved when they are not.\r\n\r\nBackground: I am running Syncthing on a slow machine. Whenever I make changes to folder settings, the WebUI changes to reflect these, giving the impression that the changes were made and have been saved. However, the changes are sent to the server asynchronously and on a slow machine it may take a very long time for them to be processed (separate bug filed for that). If I leave the webpage, the changes may not be applied on the server even though I was led to believe they were.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: leave the WebUI page open for a long time (half an hour should do) and hope the requests will get processed at some point, then refresh to see the real state.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.54, Linux (ARM)\r\nOS Version: Linux 4.14.69+ on Raspberry PI\r\nBrowser Version: Tested with Firefox and Chrome; issues appears to be server-side.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5354/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
