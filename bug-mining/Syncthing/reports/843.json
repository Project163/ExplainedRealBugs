They appeared at almost exactly the same time on all receiving devices of one shared folder (not on the sendonly master distributor). The folder on the distributor is constantly changing and can therefore provoke errors, but the panics should still not happen.\r\n\r\nI have a sanitized panic log for you. They look similar on the other devices. In total I hav 134 panics across 34 devices which are in differently sized clusters separate for windows and linux.\r\n\r\n[syncthing_panic_Index_out_of_range.log](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/files/2519163/syncthing_panic_Index_out_of_range.log)\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.51\r\nOS Version: Windows / Ubuntu/ RedHat/ CentOs/ SuSe/\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5291/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
