have been making some large scale file moves in one of my synced folders and this has caused syncthing to go **FAILED** indicating an **invalid subpath** error. \r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n- `syncthing-inotify` triggers scan of full sync path\r\n- `syncthing` returns **invalid subpath** both to the `syncthing-inotify` request and shows same in the web UI\r\n\r\nLooking at the logs for syncthing-inotify, I see the following:\r\n```\r\n[OK] Watching vc: /home/mikej/vc\r\n[WARNING] Failed to perform request Post http://127.0.0.1:8384/rest/db/scan?folder=vc&next=3600&sub=.stfolder:

for  vc Invalid HTTP status code\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n- `syncthing-inotify` triggers scan of full sync path\r\n- `syncthing` completes the scan successfully.\r\n\r\nI will also note that if I stop/disable `syncthing-inotify` and hit **Rescan** in the web UI, the sync completes successfully with no errors.\r\n\r\nI checked at the recent issues and though I believe it may be the _result_ of #3805 - because the timing works and #3805 made adjustments to the subpath detection - the problem behavior is distinct from that issue. I unfortunately could not work out how to write a test that demonstrated the error (still very new to Go), so I will have to defer that to the syncthing devs.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.15\r\nSyncthing-inotify Version: v0.8.4\r\nOS Version: Arch Linux 64bit\r\nBrowser Version: N/A\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3829/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
