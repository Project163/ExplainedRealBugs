Two new flags can also be used to affect the location of the configuration (`-config`) and database (`-data`) separately. The old `-home` flag is equivalent to setting both of these to the same directory. When no flags are given the following logic is used to determine the data location:\r\n\r\n- If a database exists in the old default location, that location is still used. This means existing installations are not affected by this change.\r\n- If `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set, use `$XDG_DATA_HOME/syncthing`.\r\n- If `~/.local/share/syncthing` exists, use that location.\r\n- Use the old default location.\r\n\r\nThis logic is used on non-Windows, non-Mac platforms only. On Windows and Mac the logic is unchanged.\r\n","creator":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":66,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-18T19:49:05Z","updated_at":"2020-05-05T06:03:45Z","due_on":"2020-05-05T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-05-05T06:03:45Z"},"comments":4,"created_at":"2020-03-20T13:44:44Z","updated_at":"2021-03-25T07:02:33Z","closed_at":"2020-03-24T11:51:19Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":" - what happened,\r\nWhen a Syncthing folder contains locally-changed-items, the red \"Revert Local Changes\" button is shown.

The first press may actually work, but the second press of the button might be needed to refresh the GUI. However, it may be a different problem, because when I reloaded the GUI at the beginning and then pressed the red button (once), it worked correctly.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v1.4.0\r\nOS Version: Synology NAS DS416play (Linux x64)\r\nBrowser Version: Firefox 68.6.0esr\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6436/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
