SyncTrayzor set's a default that makes sense but incorrectly triggers this warning (since 1.3.0). Apparently not enough people with SyncTrayzor tested RC 2, so it went unnoticed into the release. I personally have username/password set in the GUI, so I never got the message even with listen address set to \"localhost\".\r\n\r\n> SyncThing 1.2.0\r\n\r\nBy the way, it's [Syncthing not SyncThing](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/faq.html#is-it-syncthing-syncthing-or-syncthing).\r\n\r\nEDIT: I just saw you state that you get this message with listen address set to \"127.0.0.1\". Is this really what you see in SyncTrayzor? SyncTrayzor has a settings window which defaults to \"localhost:8384\". This can be accessed through File -> Settings -> Syncthing and overrides everything that you've set in the GUI.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/537253977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GermanCoding","id":4279661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzk2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4279661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding","html_url":"https://github.com/GermanCoding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2679442343,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI2Nzk0NDIzNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2679442343","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-02T06:26:54Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d93f0b"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"GermanCoding","id":4279661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzk2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4279661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding","html_url":"https://github.com/GermanCoding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-03T11:26:52Z","updated_at":"2019-10-03T11:26:52Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canton7/SyncTrayzor/issues/530","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canton7/SyncTrayzor","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canton7/SyncTrayzor/issues/530/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canton7/SyncTrayzor/issues/530/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/canton7/SyncTrayzor/issues/530/events","html_url":"https://github.com/canton7/SyncTrayzor/issues/530","id":501404700,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDE0MDQ3MDA=","number":530,"title":"\"The
