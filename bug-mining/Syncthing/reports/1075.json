My upload bandwidth isn't the greatest, and I need to pause Syncthing's comm's to maximize it for my video. It's also come up sometimes before for other reasons, but less so. \r\n\r\nBefore I would pause each of the Remote devices, but lately that's growing tedious as I have an increasing number of devices. There's also not a \"Pause all\" remote devices button, like for folders. \r\n\r\nI'm not looking for a \"Pause All\"/\"Resume All\" functionality on the remote devices either. If it were to follow the pattern used for the folders, it isn't quite right either because that doesn't keep the state of the which folders were paused before the Pause/Resume All. I'm not suggesting to change that behaviour however, just showing that it's not quite what's needed here.\r\n\r\nI just want to sometimes pause my syncthing's comm's with other devices en masse from the GUI, without changing the individual remote device's paused/unpaused state, nor without stopping the folder watching/scanning. Shutting down syncthing does achieve the effect of \"Pausing comms\", but then there's no GUI available to resume it.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v1.4.2\r\nOS Version: Debian 10\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6530/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6530/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
