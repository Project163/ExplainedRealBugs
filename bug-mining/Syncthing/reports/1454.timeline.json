Thanks for sending the patch, just the description would have just left me confused (and admittedly disinterested, being slow on slow devices isn't something I care about overly strongly - this is worse than that imo). The puller is \"so ignorant\", that it shouldn't even matter if the pausing happens during a sync. As far as I see even if the remote is paused from the get-go, we will still attempt to sync all outstanding files from it. We simply don't care if the remote is actually ready to sync, we only check that the remote has the file according to our database and that we have a connection to it. And as such do a truckload of BEP back and forth, all resulting in an error response from the remote. \r\n\r\nI don't have time right now to check this (test), but given you solved your problem with that patch I think we can consider it confirmed. There's no performance issue with your patch, just a few mechanics/structure issues (could be simpler). If you want to contribute the patch and work those issues out, please file a PR. And if you'd prefer not to (though you'd be very welcome to :) ), please say so too that someone else could pick it up. \r\n\r\n> Related: https://forum.syncthing.net/t/folders-paused-but-uploading-still-going-on-and-stalled-download/17172.\r\n\r\nI'd say probably unrelated. The forum topic describes how actual progress on file/network transfer still happens after pausing. While I believe the ticket here describes that nothing like this is happening, it's purely doing busywork without progress until finally being idle again (and out-of-sync). @hireworksltd  Could you please confirm/deny that's the case for

Purpose\r\n\r\nAs discussed in #9686 \r\nSyncthing currently does not check folderstate on remote device before pulling. If no devices have a valid folderstate (i.e all devices have the folder paused) it will still attempt to pull. On large folders this will cause a hanging \"Syncing\" status.\r\n\r\nThis checks whether at least one connected device has the file available and has a valid folderstate.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTested locally on multiple devices.\r\nWe're new to Go (all our stuff is Python) so please bear with!\r\nInterested if there may be a better place to slot this
