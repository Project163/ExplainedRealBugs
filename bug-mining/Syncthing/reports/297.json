Also this would allow tech users to help non-tech users with troubleshooting (e.g. change ping timeout, etc.) which is a lot easier and safer than telling them to open a file in a system folder with a XML editor.\n\nI suggest a simple and clean text button in the bottom left of the settings modal \n![advanced](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9367272/8408595/9dedaaa8-1e71-11e5-880f-50fb9a6f85dc.png)\n\nwhich toggles a div with a simple list like \n\n:warning: **advanced settings**\n- name of setting ......
