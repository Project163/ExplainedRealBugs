You've also got one in that list already.\r\n* Triple-DES (all those DES-CBC3 modes) is **bad**.  It's just as known broken as plain DES, and the only things being supported by that are systems that should not be on the internet to begin with.\r\n* The various AEAD modes (including ChaCha20 modes) may be new, but they're actually pretty well supported, and have undergone a reasonable amount of cryptanalysis without any issues being found.\r\n* Adding 'new' modes without removing older ones can only ever expand what you support, not reduce it.  The only exception is if there's a broken implementation of a particular mode, but that's highly unlikely.\r\n* It looks kind of bad when your main website provides better security (at least according to SSLLabs) than the GUI HTTPS connection does.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/428919542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Ferroin","id":905151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/905151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin","html_url":"https://github.com/Ferroin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/428952011","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5256#issuecomment-428952011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5256","id":428952011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyODk1MjAxMQ==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-11T13:19:15Z","updated_at":"2018-10-11T13:31:59Z","body":"I misremembered; I though we ran with the Go defaults which should be good enough, but we already have a hardcoded list to git rid of old RC4 stuff.
