hashing slows the actual hashing down almost an order of magnitude. It seems there is no hardware acceleration for it. I'm not sure what the requirements for a weak hash function are, but it could be much faster if it's hardware accelerated.\r\n\r\nAccording to  `/proc/cpuinfo`, these features are supported:\r\n```\r\nFeatures        : fp asimd evtstrm aes pmull sha1 sha2 crc32\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe we can use one of those for the weak hash?\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\n    Syncthing Version: v0.14.21\r\n    Android Version: Android 7.0\r\n    Device: LG G4 (Snapdragon 808)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1438879328,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE0Mzg4NzkzMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1438879328","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-24T07:00:49Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1438879338,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTQzODg3OTMzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1438879338","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-24T07:00:50Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
