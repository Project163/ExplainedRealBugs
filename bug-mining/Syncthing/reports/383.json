When verbose mode was working normally, messages were coming very often, few times per second. Then a sync from my other device occured and verbose logging stopped. Only rare INFO messages were coming. \"scanning\" and \"idle\" events in web GUI were still observable, so Syncthing apparently hasn't stopped working, it just went into non-verbose output mode in terminal.\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2561/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
