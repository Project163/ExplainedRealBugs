As far as I understood, syncthing will sort in memory (inMemoryIndexSorter) and switch to disk (onDiskIndexSorter) after exceeding a size threshold. The onDiskIndexSorter creates a temporary directory in the default TempDir, which is /tmp on linux.\n\nNowadays, many linux distributions mount a tmpfs on /tmp, which is a RAM-based filesystem. So, the onDiskIndexSorter will in this case also sort in memory.\n\n`ioutil.TempDir(syncthingHome, \"syncthing-db.\")` could be a good option to get this right.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/235563720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xduugu","id":1039174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu","html_url":"https://github.com/xduugu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/235605944","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3449#issuecomment-235605944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3449","id":235605944,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTYwNTk0NA==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-27T14:39:11Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T14:39:11Z","body":"`~/.config` nor `~/Library/Application Support` nor the roaming profile dir on Windows are really for temp files?

just noticed my backup program (attic/borg backup) backing up a number of syncthing folders, which are called tmp-index-sorter.##### and live in the config directory. I understand these are db files enabling the delta-indexing algorithm. In the past I would ignore folders by placing a \"cachedir.tag\" file into folders I don't want backed up.\nIn this case I was puzzled by their naming scheme though- they are called \"tmp*\" -something , but don't seem to be more temporal than the actual database-folder. My initial thought was thus not to place the cachedir.tag -files there, since \"tmp\"-folders tend to get cleaned up at times (?!)\nAlso, there are quite a number of \"tmp-index-sorter\"-folders, and it looks untidy. O:-) At least much less tidy than I am used to from syncthing.\nWouldn't it make more sense to at least put all the index-related db-folders into an extra subfolder say $st_home/index/ ?\n\nSo I guess I am proposing both a naming-scheme change and a location change...\nEDIT: Just saw this related https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3449 closed issue, so I guess you guys are somewhat aware of the issue\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3529/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1182737261,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExODI3MzcyNjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1182737261","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-28T00:13:07Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1182737265,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTE4MjczNzI2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1182737265","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-28T00:13:07Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
