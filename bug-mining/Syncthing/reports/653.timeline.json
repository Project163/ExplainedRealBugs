folder, to have it sorted, if there are many shared folders), and would be accepted automaticaly.\n\nLike this, user must not manualy accept every share, on every sync machines (devices), separatelly.

Assume that with that change in place, the folder would have an _ID_ like `12E0E35A-A25C-4C12-9388-FE170213153C` and a _label_ like `[!!] ~~Awesome files~~ \\o/`. The label comes from the other side, but you may want to set something different (`Not quite awesome files {from calmh}`) What's the default folder

 I'm missing some things from the first day I installed Syncthing. Really small improvements but important in my opinion.\n\n  The order of fields and features of fields when entering a new shared folder, right now are like that:\n\n1-FOLDER LABEL (you have to enter it manually and/or copypaste it from 3rd field)\n2-FOLDER ID (could keep being automatic, you don't have to worry about it I think)\n3-FOLDER PATH (you have to enter manually the full path. I know popup some options while you are typing the correct path, but...)\n\nI think it will be much easier to enter a new folder as:\n\n1-FOLDER PATH [BROWSE...]. In which you can enter a path manually or use the browse button and select it. Of course, when you enter browse you should fall into the 'Default path' feature commented at  issue #2157. For sure almost all of us have a SYNCTHINGshares (or whatever) folder in which we first create our new folder and copy things in, and then we jump to the web browser to share it. Falling directly into our SYNCTHINGshares, will be great.\n\n2-FOLDER LABEL. It should be taken automatically right after you have selected the folder path, just by adding the folder name as the 'folder label' here. For example with the sample above SYNCTHINGshares\\MyMusic, 'MyMusic' should be the auto-proposal of syncthing when filling the 'folder label' field. 99% times user will left folder label with that name.\n\n3-FOLDER ID. This could be even greyed out and not editable, almost transparent for the final user, first time I enter a folder I didn't know if I should change the given name or not or what.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3169/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/227396254","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2157#issuecomment-227396254","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2157","id":227396254,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzM5NjI1NA==","user":{"login":"funkyfuture","id":2004405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDQ0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2004405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfuture","html_url":"https://github.com/funkyfuture","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfuture/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfuture/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfuture/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfuture/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfuture/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfuture/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfuture/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfuture/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/funkyfuture/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-21T10:04:43Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T10:04:43Z","body":"it would also be great to have an option that if enabled restricts the selection of folders to that default parent path.
