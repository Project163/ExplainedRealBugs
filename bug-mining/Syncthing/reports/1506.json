What happened?\n\n**What happened**  \nThe function `discover` returns a slice of `IGDService` structs.  \n`IGDService` contains a `nat.Service`, which contains a `sync.RWMutex`.  \nIterating over the slice with `for _, igd := range igds` copies the structure, including the RWMutex.  \nGo linters (e.g., `go vet`) report:  \n`assignment copies lock value to igd: IGDService contains Service with sync.RWMutex`.  \n\n**What I expected instead**  \nTo avoid copying the mutex, the function could return `[]*IGDService` instead of `[]IGDService`.\n\n**Environment**  \n- Syncthing version: v2.0.10\n- OS: Linux x86_64\n\n**Additional info**  \nAll existing tests pass with the proposed change.\n\n### Syncthing version\n\nv2.0.10\n\n### Platform & operating system\n\nLinux x86_64\n\n### Browser version\n\nMozilla Firefox 143.0.4\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\n```","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
