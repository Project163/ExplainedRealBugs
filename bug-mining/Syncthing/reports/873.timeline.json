Changes: There are various folder settings that are shown in the main page. I was changing folder type from \"Send & Receive\" to \"Receive only\", which changes the folder icon in the main page immediately. I did not check but expect that changing settings such as \"Folder Label\" and \"Shared With Devices\" will also result in immediate changes to the main page.\r\n\r\nWrt. requests being dropped: I assume your server has a timeout on processing requests, which would be the main concern (I am seeing HTTP 500 responses sometimes but these do not mention timeout). The server may also discards queued requests as soon as the connection to the client is dropped (which might make sense in some case because it cannot send a response). If so, navigating to a different page or closing the tab would result in the browser closing the connection and the server never processing the requests. I am not familiar with how the Syncthing HTTP server works but I can tell you that changes I made in the WebUI were not applied after more than 15 minutes and the only way to find out was by refreshing the page to update the UI to the actual values.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/445240465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SkyLined","id":1959110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTkxMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1959110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyLined","html_url":"https://github.com/SkyLined","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyLined/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyLined/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyLined/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyLined/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyLined/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyLined/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyLined/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyLined/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkyLined/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/445323711","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5354#issuecomment-445323711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5354","id":445323711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTMyMzcxMQ==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-07T18:32:47Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T18:32:47Z","body":"(From
