There were several issues at the time; performance, lack of required concurrency in some cases, and difficulty in cross compilation. This time I intend to take a slightly different approach, with slightly different goals, and also things have changed in the wider ecosystem.\n\n- Instead of using it as a dumb key-value store I will use wider tables with at least some fields of the underlying data exposed as columns. The intention is to use native SQLite indexes and processes for a lot of the metadata housekeeping we do manually today.\n- If having long running write transactions is still a problem I'll work to split them up -- for example, having a puller iteration be for only a subset of files rather than all that are needed at the time. For ordering items (by size, modification time, etc) we can use SQL constructions with a limit clause.\n- There are multiple implementations of SQLite available, the most common being the regular C implementation with a wrapper, which we can use for most builds. For the more exotic builds there is a Go translation of the C source code, which is equally cross compilable to what we have today. We can use either or both as required.\n- I'm willing to accept a certain level of performance degradation if it results in improved stability and maintainability.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9954/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9954/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
