Any specific reason why `curl` wouldn't cut it?\r\n\r\nSince I'm just a user, I looked at the [intro docs](https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/) and [user docs](https://docs.syncthing.net/users/), didn't find a solution there, then discovering the `cli` command via `syncthing -h`. The REST docs are collapsed under the \"Development\" section of the documentation on the website, so I wasn't even aware there was a REST API. (I don't consider my basic initial setup task to be \"development\".)\r\n\r\nIn addition to not being super obvious/discoverable for a beginner user, the REST/curl-based solution doesn't have great ergonomics, either in construction of the command line (there's no command auto-completion, so you have to: find, open and grok the REST docs...copy and paste the curl command and HTTP header from the docs...open the config file and copy and paste the apikey...identify then copy and paste the relevant endpoint from the docs), or great ergonomics in the necessity for parsing of JSON if the user is creating their own setup script.\r\n\r\nIt also raises the technical barrier for CLI users who aren't familiar with REST/curl.\r\n\r\nFor an inexperienced first-time Syncthing user trying to get through the initial setup and needing some very basic information (the device ID of the other machine on my LAN), the above friction seems a bit rough. If I was trying to fiddle with some obscure configuration as a more experienced user that would be a different thing.\r\n\r\nAnyway, just trying to provide insight into my first-time user experience in the hopes you guys can use it to make Syncthing even more approachable and awesome. Make of it what you will. :-) Thanks for your contributions, regardless of the outcome here.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/947830526/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jwatt","id":325860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/325860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt","html_url":"https://github.com/jwatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5493134448,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAOCAEs49XwiSzwAAAAFHapRw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/5493134448","actor":{"login":"jwatt","id":325860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/325860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt","html_url":"https://github.com/jwatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-20T16:24:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5493134459,"node_id":"SE_lADOAOCAEs49XwiSzwAAAAFHapR7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/5493134459","actor":{"login":"jwatt","id":325860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/325860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt","html_url":"https://github.com/jwatt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwatt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-20T16:24:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/947947693","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8007#issuecomment-947947693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8007","id":947947693,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAOCAEs44gIit","user":{"login":"acolomb","id":6996887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTY4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6996887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb","html_url":"https://github.com/acolomb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-20T18:55:15Z","updated_at":"2021-10-20T18:55:15Z","body":"Yeah,
