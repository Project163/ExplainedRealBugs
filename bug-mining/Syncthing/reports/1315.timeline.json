Purpose\r\n\r\nEncrypted folders should not have the fs watcher enabled and rarely benefit from a scheduled rescan.  Versioning does not work well for them either.  The GUI adjusts the suggested settings accordingly (watcher disabled, one day rescan interval, no versioning) when accepting a receive-encrypted folder.  Mirror that behavior to the auto-accept case where the GUI is not involved.\r\n\r\nFor watcher and rescan, the defaults are overridden especially in `handleAutoAccepts()`, while the versioning is filtered out completely in the backend's `FolderConfiguration.prepare()`.\r\n\r\nFixes #8296.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nManual testing with auto-accept enabled or disabled from a certain remote device.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nIs it worth mentioning this automatic override in the docs?  The only place I've found is at https://docs.syncthing.net/users/config.html#config-option-device.autoacceptfolders, which is pretty terse in general.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8427/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8427/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7045070583,"node_id":"CE_lADOAOCAEs5IM6t6zwAAAAGj6z73","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/7045070583","actor":{"login":"acolomb","id":6996887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTY4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6996887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb","html_url":"https://github.com/acolomb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-22T09:28:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7045070765,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs5IM6t6zwAAAAGj6z-t","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/7045070765","actor":{"login":"acolomb","id":6996887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTY4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6996887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb","html_url":"https://github.com/acolomb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a6dba7c6d6d69cc2f9c25ed2b7964552b2c33b09","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/a6dba7c6d6d69cc2f9c25ed2b7964552b2c33b09","created_at":"2022-07-22T09:28:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7046976732,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs5IM6t6zwAAAAGkCFTc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/7046976732","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ae240044ea4f67a307d57b8a5c1a66329d2b41d4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/ae240044ea4f67a307d57b8a5c1a66329d2b41d4","created_at":"2022-07-22T14:29:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7061949945,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs5IM6t6zwAAAAGk7M35","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/7061949945","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/or
