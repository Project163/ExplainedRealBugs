have Syncthing running via SyncTrayzor with a single instance on a Windows 2012 R2 server hosting multiple folders, each of which is connected to a single Syncthing instance running via SyncTrayzor on a users laptop.  The folders on the server are also shared via SMB for when the user logs on to a device other than their dedicated laptop.\n\nThe folders on the server are populated with data and we install and set up a laptop with a fresh folder to synchronise (this folder contains the basic structure of a windows documents folder, with a few folder redirections, such as desktop and links)\n\nAfter the initial sync on a most laptops we notice errors such as these (specific to the user in question)\n\nThe Downloads.lnk file is present on both sides when the sync starts and will often result in a conflict file being created.\n\n```\n2016-05-03 11:19:43.5268 #1160 [Debug] SyncTrayzor.Syncthing.EventWatcher.SyncthingEventWatcher: Received 6 events \n2016-05-03 11:19:43.5268 #1160 [Debug] SyncTrayzor.Syncthing.SyncthingProcessRunner: [UVYNR] 11:19:43 INFO: Puller (folder \"willenbrocka\", file \"My Settings\\\\links\\\\Downloads.lnk\"): pull: peers who had this file went away, or the file has changed while syncing. will retry later \n```\n\nThis error goes away after a rescan (we have it set to 1 hour as we are using the Filewatcher in Synctrayzor for the immediate changes and frequent scanning of 200+ folders causes huge IO on the server) however as per the log below SyncTrayzor has already successfully sent an API request to scan the folder\n\nCanton7 was extremely helpful and we concluded that SyncTrayzor was sending the API call to Syncthing without issue on [SyncTrayzor issue  256](https://github.com/canton7/SyncTrayzor/issues/256) (starts about halfway down on my reply starting \"This might not be related, but we are seeing this popping up in the logs quite regularly,\"\n\n```\n2016-05-03 11:18:22.7096 #5556 [Debug] SyncTrayzor.Syncthing.EventWatcher.SyncthingEventWatcher: <ItemStarted ID=3284 Time=03/05/2016 11:18:22 Item=my settings\\links\\Downloads.lnk Folder=willenbrocka Type=File Action=Update>\n2016-05-03 11:18:22.7096 #5556 [Debug] SyncTrayzor.Syncthing.TransferHistory.SyncthingTransferHistory: Item started.

created windows .lnk files so are not important, however I really wanted to make sure that this doesn't happen with other conflicted files and felt it was worth a bug report.\n\nThanks!\n### Version

(v0.14.40) does not work with Onedrive on Windows 10 Fall Creator Update (version 1709) properly in some cases. \r\n\r\nIn Win 10 Fall Creators Update, Microsoft changed how Onedrive operates NTFS filesystem. Now OneDrive creates [reparsepoints](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365503(v=vs.85).aspx) (an NTFS feature). Syncthing forum user \"geeksquad\" explained it [here](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/folder-path-missing-even-the-path-exists-onedrive-win10-fall-creators-update/10913/4). It seems Syncthing is refusing to recognize a OneDrive directory using _reparsepoints_ and reports an error message \"folder path missing\". \r\n\r\n> [ZEER7] 12:49:24 WARNING: Creating folder marker: folder path missing\r\n> [ZEER7] 12:49:24 INFO: Restarted folder \"EXAMPLE\" (xxxxx-yyyyy) (readwrite)\r\n> [ZEER7] 12:49:24 INFO: Connection to WJXMAFI closed: reading length: read tcp 192.168.1.2:51413->192.168.1.3:22000: use of closed network connection\r\n> [ZEER7] 12:49:24 WARNING: Error on folder \"EXAMPLE\" (xxxxx-yyyyy): folder path missing\r\n> [ZEER7] 12:49:24 INFO: Failed initial scan of readwrite folder \"EXAMPLE\" (xxxxx-yyyyy)\r\n\r\nI have 2 OneDrive synced directories on a same computer synced with Syncthing to a Linux server. Based on my experiments the following factors may impact on the success of getting Syncthing to sync a OneDrive folder: \r\n\r\n1. I have OneDrive Business and standard OneDrive folders and only the ordinary OneDrive folder syncs properly. There might or might not be a issue related to Onedrive Business. \r\n2.  In case of the (standard) OneDrive, the synced folder is not the root OneDrive folder, but a folder under the Onedrive root folder. Syncthing syncs this folder under the OneDrive root folder OK.\r\n3. In the case of the OneDrive Business folder, I am trying to sync the OneDrive Business root folder, but after updating to Win10 Fall Creators Update, Syncthing stopped syncing this folder. \r\n4. Syncthing does not sync properly any OneDrive or OneDrive Business folder IF _Files On-demand_ feature has been enabled on the OneDrive. Microsoft introduced this feature in Win 10 Fall Creators Update and it is enabled by default. I have disabled it manually. \r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.40 Win 64-bit\r\nOS Version: Windows 10 Fall Creator Update (Version >= 1709 )\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4542/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/354407429","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1845#issuecomment-354407429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1845","id":354407429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NDQwNzQyOQ==","user":{"login":"niphlod","id":122119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjExOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niphlod","html_url":"https://github.com/niphlod","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niphlod/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niphlod/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niphlod/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niphlod/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niphlod/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niphlod/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niphlod/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niphlod/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niphlod/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-29T07:03:57Z","updated_at":"2017-12-29T07:03:57Z","body":"I'm absolutely not a go dev but another go project solved it.
