When running `go run build.go test` locally with that umask, the test suite fails:\r\n\r\n    --- FAIL: TestChmodDir (0.00s)\r\n        basicfs_test.go:126: wrong perm: true 0750\r\n    FAIL\r\n    FAIL\tgithub.com/syncthing/syncthing/lib/fs\t0.408s\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the `Mkdir()` function subtracting the effective umask from the given mode argument, [as documented](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#Mkdir).  So the test can only succeed if the developer's umask allows creation of directories with a mode of 755.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether this has any real-world effects besides the test suite failing.
