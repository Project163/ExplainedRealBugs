This is because ntfs-3g is not currently able to understand folders/files with reparse points.  It would be unlikely that Syncthing would be able to get around it without removing the reparse point. (https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/1941#issuecomment-341907453)\r\nI haven't done extensive testing on this, but I've heard another user mention that using the NTFS kernel implementation instead of the ntfs-3g driver will allow you to at least view the contents of the folder/file. Unfortunately the kernel implementation doesn't support writing to NTFS filesystems.  \r\n\r\nIf people are syncing their OneDrive folder on Linux using the Windows partition copy, a quick workaround would be to use a script to execute the deletion of the reparse point on restart/shutdown on the Windows side.  Deletion of the reparse point doesn't effect anything, as far as I can tell... But perhaps the story is different when you enable OneDrive's new \"Files on Demand\" feature.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/346536329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"clee231","id":1387910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODc5MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1387910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee231","html_url":"https://github.com/clee231","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee231/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee231/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee231/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee231/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee231/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee231/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee231/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee231/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clee231/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/346543593","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4542#issuecomment-346543593","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4542","id":346543593,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjU0MzU5Mw==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-23T07:05:47Z","updated_at":"2017-11-23T07:05:47Z","body":"I think this is a conceptual problem, not a Syncthing problem. It's true that the reparse point is the direct cause of the failure, as that isn't presented in a way we expect in either the Go runtime or the lower level Windows APIs (I don't know which).

It would be neat if someone with the appropriate Windows could confirm one way or the other. Likewise on #1845.\r\n\r\nI was going to propose (configurably, maybe) disabling the symlink check on Windows as *today* it mostly would not be a security issue to do so (only admins and devs can create them). But if it doesn't solve these issues it's pointless.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/352519771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/352520970","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4542#issuecomment-352520970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4542","id":352520970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjUyMDk3MA==","user":{"login":"Ferroin","id":905151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/905151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin","html_url":"https://github.com/Ferroin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ferroin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-18T18:45:12Z","updated_at":"2017-12-18T18:45:12Z","body":"I can't confirm because I don't use OneDrive myself, but I'm fairly certain that the reparse point that is the root of a OneDrive directory _is not_ a symlink, but instead an indirection to a filesystem translation filter that provides the sync integration with OneDrive.
