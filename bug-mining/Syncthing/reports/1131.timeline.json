me how much you hate me.\r\n\r\nThis was a long and manual effort of translating from one to another....\r\n\r\n### What does this give us\r\n\r\nThis PR at this point is completely noop and gives us nothing.\r\n\r\nEven if someone generated java classes from the proto files and serialized and posted the config using JSON, it would not work,\r\nas we don't use proto json serialization, but we use `encoding/json`, which disagrees on the the field naming.\r\n\r\nWe could add a new rest endpoint that uses proto serialization, but it's probably better to build out a new API all together.\r\n\r\nThis does however open a possibility to build a GRPC API on top of this.\r\n\r\n### How do I know I haven't screwed something up?\r\n\r\nI wrote a small script `proto/scripts/dump_tags.go` that walked the config struct and dumped it's tags into a CSV.\r\nI then compared the CSV of this PR with the CSV of main branch and ended up with this diff:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1144861/90547906-1441a300-e184-11ea-91f9-a1bd078fa5d7.png)\r\n\r\n### Follow-ups \r\n\r\nThis is also an opportunity to clean up the names of the variables atleast in the proto contract, so no more ururl, crurl etc.\r\nOpen to further suggestions here.\r\n\r\nI potentially intend to follow up this PR removing most of the `(ext.goname)` stuff, because `CRURL` is super cryptic, and I suspect having magical Go names might not be kosher with grpc-gateway going forward, as I think it expects standard proto compiler generated fields. This is yet to be seen.\r\n\r\nI guess this means LDAP, TLS, ID will become Ldap, Tls, Id, but I think it's an ok price to pay in our own codebase.\r\n\r\nFixes
