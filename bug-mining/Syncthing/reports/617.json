Everything is fine. Then I delete it. Everything is fine, but I send this index update:\r\n\r\n```\r\nname: \"small_new_logo2 (copie 1) (copie 1).png\"\r\nmodified_s: 1490123996\r\ndeleted: true\r\nversion {\r\n  counters {\r\n    id: 12341524340436289198\r\n    value: 2\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nsequence: 1256\r\nmodified_ns: 235634803\r\nBlocks {\r\n  size: 3814\r\n  hash: \"\\264]\\013_G\\030\\243\\024njt\\014K24\\313w\\010<\\370\\036\\355\\265\\022\\241\\2770\\240L\\324\\345|\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nRemark: I send blocks. This seems stupid, but the variable wasn't cleanup on my side when the file was deleted.\r\nSyncthing delete the file, no problem.\r\n\r\nThen, I add the same file again, and syncthing is stuck. The file is not added back, and I have this errors in logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(...)\r\n[XXX] 20:23:12 INFO: Puller (folder \"synctest\", file \"small_new_logo2 (copie 1) (copie 1).png\"): shortcut: chmod: chmod /home/XXX/SyncTest/small_new_logo2 (copie 1) (copie 1).png: no such file or directory\r\n[XXX] 20:23:12 INFO: Puller: shortcut: chmod /home/XXX/SyncTest/small_new_logo2 (copie 1) (copie 1).png: no such file or directory\r\n[XXX] 20:23:12 INFO: Folder \"synctest\" isn't making progress. Pausing puller for 1m0s.\r\n```\r\nSending a correct index update for a deleted file, without blocks, fix the issue.\r\n\r\nAgain, I know it's stupid to send blocks of a deleted file, it doesn't make sense. But syncthing should be able to handle the case, no ? Or the protocol definition should be updated to prevent client to send blocks ?\r\n\r\nIf needed I can try to make a PR with one of the \"fix\".\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.24\r\nOS Version: ArchLinux\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4053/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4053/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
