But I think the user experience is really bad if the user doesn't supply the password, but has to find an automatically generated one, then log in and change it.  At least on SynoCommunity, there are many packages asking for credentials during setup to protect some software's admin GUI.  I'd like to stick to that pattern, so the only missing component in that case is the bcrypt hashing and (offline) `config.xml` manipulation.  I wouldn't know how to display the generated credentials to the user after the service has been started for the first time -- that happens after setup.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/951837413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"acolomb","id":6996887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTY4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6996887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb","html_url":"https://github.com/acolomb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/951843957","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8021#issuecomment-951843957","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8021","id":951843957,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAOCAEs44u_x1","user":{"login":"bt90","id":1926175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjYxNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1926175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90","html_url":"https://github.com/bt90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bt90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-26T11:31:52Z","updated_at":"2021-10-26T11:31:52Z","body":"A

Including the ability to not supply a path at all so it uses the default. Which I think the old option should have supported from the start.\n\nI'll see what I can come up with, trying to keep it simple.

When it's done as part of regular startup for \"serve\", using the advanced logger makes sense and I don't want to affect that mode of operation. But for the subcommand logging can be very simple.

Purpose\r\n\r\nThis is part of the solution for #8021, but makes sense as an isolated change.\r\n\r\nWhat hash is used to store the password should ideally be an implementation detail, so that every user of the GUIConfiguration object automatically agrees on how to handle it.  That is currently distribututed over the confighandler.go and api_auth.go files, plus tests.\r\n\r\nAdd the `SetHasedPassword()` / `CompareHashedPassword()` API to keep the hashing method encapsulated.  Add a separate test for it and adjust other users and tests.  Remove all deprecated imports of the bcrypt package.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n`TestGUIPasswordHash()` added for the new config API.
