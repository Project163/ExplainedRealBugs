Because I'm having trouble getting IPv6 multicast to work, I posted a question about it on stack overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31574247/gcdasyncudpsocket-cannot-get-udp-multicast-over-ipv6-to-work?noredirect=1#comment51108878_31574247. I don't know too much about IPv6 yet, but on stack overflow it is claimed that the Syncthing multicast address (ff32::5222), as specified in https://github.com/syncthing/specs/blob/master/DISCOVERYv2.md, is reserved for future use (referring to http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv6-multicast-addresses/ipv6-multicast-addresses.xhtml#unicast-multicast-group-ids). \n\nCould someone with enough knowledge on this have a look at it? If this is a bug in the specification, it would be good to fix it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
