https://forum.syncthing.net/t/utf8-encoding-conflict-with-another-file/11122.\r\n\r\nIt turns out that ZFS doesn't do any normalization when storing files,\r\nbut does do normalization \"as part of any comparison process\".\r\n\r\nIn practice, this seems to mean that if you LStat a normalized filename,\r\nZFS will return the FileInfo for the un-normalized version of that\r\nfilename.\r\n\r\nThis means that our test to see whether a separate file with a\r\nnormalized version of the filename already exists was failing, as we\r\nwere detecting the same file.","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
