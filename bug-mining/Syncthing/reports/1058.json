Two new flags can also be used to affect the location of the configuration (`-config`) and database (`-data`) separately. The old `-home` flag is equivalent to setting both of these to the same directory. When no flags are given the following logic is used to determine the data location:\r\n\r\n- If a database exists in the old default location, that location is still used. This means existing installations are not affected by this change.\r\n- If `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set, use `$XDG_DATA_HOME/syncthing`.\r\n- If `~/.local/share/syncthing` exists, use that location.\r\n- Use the old default location.\r\n\r\nThis logic is used on non-Windows, non-Mac platforms only. On Windows and Mac the logic is unchanged.\r\n","creator":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":66,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-03-18T19:49:05Z","updated_at":"2020-05-05T06:03:45Z","due_on":"2020-05-05T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-05-05T06:03:45Z"},"comments":11,"created_at":"2020-03-15T19:42:50Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T07:02:35Z","closed_at":"2020-03-30T21:28:54Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"### Problem\r\nWhen using staggered versioning, syncthing deletes versions withing the 30-days limit that are NOT closer than 1 day.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n- Setup a test folder with staggered versioning, leave default settings\r\n- Create dummy version files in the .stversions-folder named `testfile~YYYYMMDD-000000` one for each day reaching back 30 days in the past starting from now\r\n- Restart syncthing to trigger version cleanup\r\n- Syncthing is cleaning versions which are older than 6 days, leaving one file per week\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nSyncthing leaves all versions untouched, since documentation says:\r\n> For the first 30 days, the most recent version is kept every day.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\nSyncthing Version: v1.3.4\r\nOS Version: Ubuntu 19.10\r\n\r\n\r\nI have investigated the situation by looking at the code in `lib/versioner/staggered.go`. There is one digit missing in the number of seconds specifying the 30-days-interval.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterval: [4]interval{\r\n    {30, 3600},       // first hour -> 30 sec between versions\r\n    {3600, 86400},    // next day -> 1 h between versions\r\n    {86400, 592000},  // next 30 days -> 1 day between versions  // This line is causing the issue\r\n    {604800, maxAge}, // next year -> 1 week between versions\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe number saying `592000` actually is a time period of 6.8 days only instead of the intended 30 days. The correct number would be `2592000` (Note the leading 2 which is missing).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the tests implemented in `lib/versioner/staggered_test.go` do not cover the issue above.\r\n\r\nI have fixed the interval number and updated the tests and could provide a patch for that.","closed_by":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6410/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
