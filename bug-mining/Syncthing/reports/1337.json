removing the `security.selinux` xattr from a file is not allowed unless the user has acquired superuser privileges first, so syncthing should probably leave attributes that are related to SELinux alone (as far as I can see, that's only the `security.selinux` attribute).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nsyncthing version: v1.22.0\r\noperating system: tested on Fedora Linux 36 ,37, and Rawhide (development
