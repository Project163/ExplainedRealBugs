we can detect the amount of space left on the device, what would we aim for as a limit? We may create temporary copies of (by default) up to 16 files when synchronizing them, so we would need to reserve space for at least copies of the 16 largest files in the repo to be sure a sync is going to work. But that could mean we want 100 GB of free space just to update a text file.\n\nWe could try to do the check just before copying a file, possibly, and skipping it if the amount of free space looks marginal (I recall trying something like this in a branch ages ago, I wonder what happened to that...). We'll try smaller files in that case (as we always try to sync the next file in the list if one file fails for whatever reason), so we might still get very close to full filesystem - basically as close as the smallest file we have in the repo.\n\nWe could do as above (check before each file) but stop completely once it doesn't fit. That'd probably be fairly safe (barring the multiple-files-being-synced-in-paralell thing that may need handling) but also means we wouldn't be syncing stuff that we otherwise could have been.\n\nAbsolute values are obviously no good (8 GB free would be a good warning limit on my photo folder, but not on a phone), percentages likewise (5% of my data pool is still 900 GB)...\n\nUser configurable, possibly, but the less we need to ask for the better... And it needs to actually work. I.e. whatever method we choose should mean we _don't_ fill the disk, which would not be the case by for example just going with a 95% full limit as we might still try to sync a file that's 6% of the total disk size.\n\nIf we end up with something advanced (at least space for the file we're going to sync, plus 50% overhead, but at least 10 MiB, unless that's more than 10% of the disk space, but only for folders larger than x...) this needs to be understandable to the user...\n\n(This is not a rethorical question... Contrary to Audrius I think this might be a `help-wanted` but then we at least need to clarify how it should work. :)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/121198980/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/121286980","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2057#issuecomment-121286980","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2057","id":121286980,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMTI4Njk4MA==","user":{"login":"cs42","id":103868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzg2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs42","html_url":"https://github.com/cs42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cs42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-14T15:49:06Z","updated_at":"2015-07-14T15:49:06Z","body":"I think having a resonable percentage as default (I'd vote for 10%) should be good and than this could be an advanced option.
