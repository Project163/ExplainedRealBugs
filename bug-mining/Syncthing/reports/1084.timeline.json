Files that are still pending deduplication are processed as expected. Folders are also processed as normal.\n\nA bit of digging indicates that os.Lstat on a deduped file has a FileMode containing ModeSymLink. Looking at the Read function in [symlink_windows.go](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/internal/symlinks/symlink_windows.go#L104), the type of reparse point is available in reparseData.reparseTag, which should allow for correctly handling the condition. \n\nA quick reference to the tag values is available in [smbfsctl.h](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/cifs/smbfsctl.h#L100). Of interest are:\n- IO_REPARSE_TAG_DEDUP = 0x80000013\n- IO_REPARSE_TAG_SYMLINK = 0xA000000C\n- IO_REPARSE_TAG_MOUNT_POINT = 0xA0000003 (may be related to #1830)\n- More info about [Reparse Points](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365511%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) and supported operations\n\nFor reference, it is possible to query a reparse point's tag and data with <code>fsutil reparsepoint query PATH_TO_FILE</code>. This even works across SMB shares with UNC paths.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1845/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/126841389","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1830#issuecomment-126841389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1830","id":126841389,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNjg0MTM4OQ==","user":{"login":"da2x","id":1102886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDI4ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1102886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x","html_url":"https://github.com/da2x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-01T00:48:51Z","updated_at":"2015-08-01T00:48:51Z","body":"Go 1.4 and newer treats junctions the same was as symlinks, as far as I can tell from reading through the Go bugtracker and changelogs.\n\nOne of the problem here lies with relying on Syncthing's internal symlinks.Supported bool. It assumes the user always wants to both create and read junctions, where as most of the time it's only useful to read them for unprivileged users. I've got little experience with Golang, but managed to strip out enough of these checks to make junctions work seemingly fine. Wouldn't trust to run this on actual data, though.\n\nI humbly request prioritization of this for a proper cleanup. At least for reading (any user) if not creating new junctions (requires admin).\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/126841389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"da2x","id":1102886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDI4ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1102886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x","html_url":"https://github.com/da2x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/da2x/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":503790283,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDUwMzc5MDI4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/503790283","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-01T14:45:39Z","milestone":{"title":"Unplanned"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":503790284,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDUwMzc5MDI4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/503790284","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-01T14:45:39Z","milestone":{"title":"Unplanned"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":503796363,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50NTAzNzk2MzYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/503796363","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-01T15:41:49Z","label":{"name":"help-wanted","color":"5319e7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1468425737,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MTQ2ODQyNTczNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1468425737","actor":{"login":
