would like to be able to sync my .config directory with syncthing without it breaking across multiple machines.\r\n\r\nThe reason it breaks now is due to the fact that the local installation stores database and certificates and such local deployment data under the same directory.\r\n\r\nI think sharing .config wholesale is possible without having to exclude or move .config/syncthing if we consider what is sharable data and what is local data.\r\n\r\nI will add my findings here but please jump in if you either have explored this already or you are interested in exploring this.\r\n\r\nhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9178/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/9178/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
