Worst case you might get a short\r\n\"that's a bug, please report it on GitHub\" response on the forum, in which\r\ncase we thank you for your patience and following our advice. :)\r\n\r\n### Please use the correct issue tracker\r\n\r\nIf your problem relates to a Syncthing wrapper or [sub-project](https://github.com/syncthing) such as [Syncthing for Android](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-android/issues), [SyncTrayzor](https://github.com/canton7/synctrayzor) or the [documentation](https://github.com/syncthing/docs/issues), please use their respective issue trackers.\r\n\r\n### Does your log mention database corruption?\r\n\r\nIf your Syncthing log reports panics because of database corruption it is most likely a fault with your system's storage or memory. Affected log entries will contain lines starting with `panic: leveldb`. You will need to delete the index database to clear this, by running `syncthing -reset-database`.\r\n\r\n### Please do post actual bug reports and feature requests.\r\n\r\nIf your issue is a bug report, replace this boilerplate with a description\r\nof the problem, being sure to include at least:\r\n\r\n - what happened,\r\n - what you expected to happen instead, and\r\n - any steps to reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nAlso fill out the version information below and add log output or\r\nscreenshots as appropriate.\r\n\r\nIf your issue is a feature request, simply replace this template text in\r\nits entirety.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.x.y\r\nOS Version: Windows 7 / Ubuntu 14.04 / ...\r\nBrowser Version: (if applicable, for GUI issues)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5588/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/472622643","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5578#issuecomment-472622643","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5578","id":472622643,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjYyMjY0Mw==","user":{"login":"ewpt3ch","id":751656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MTY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/751656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewpt3ch","html_url":"https://github.com/ewpt3ch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewpt3ch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewpt3ch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewpt3ch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewpt3ch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewpt3ch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewpt3ch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewpt3ch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewpt3ch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ewpt3ch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-13T21:59:05Z","updated_at":"2019-03-13T21:59:05Z","body":"> v1.1.0\r\n@st-release st-release released this 8 days ago · 39 commits to master since this release\r\nwarning Notice warning\r\nDue to adopting Go 1.12 and API changes there this release does not work on Windows XP / Server 2003 / Home Server.

change between Go 1.11 (worked) 1.12 (fails) or revisiting the use of `\\\\?\\` in general as proposed by calmh would be preferable:\r\n\r\n> Do we need `\\\\?\\` anywhere at all any more? Go 1.8 (!) added a change 10 that should use long filenames “when possible” which I think should cover all the regular OS stuff. Maybe the filewatcher library does need it if it does direct syscalls, but then it could fixup the path to whatever is the right format, and maybe only do so if it’s longer 260 chars etc?\r\n\r\nHowever the former needs debugging and I don't want to do the latter without more thought/testing put into it, that's why I propose to merge this hotfix for 1.1.2 if neither of the two
