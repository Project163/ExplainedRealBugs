once pushed for a proper fix for this in #2227 (which eliminates the need for users to fiddle around with the config files) but it was nuked & locked because I pointed out the logical fallacy behind this broken implementation which assumes \"1% your HDD is smaller than the space syncthing needs, regardless of the size of your HDD\". (for the record, my particular case is an 8TB, which is nothing surprising these days and %1 corresponds to 80GB, which is way way below the space syncthing actually need).\n\nAnd mind you, disk sizes are only going to grow. And I'm not even talking about LVM or  btrfs multi-device fs. You can buy 10TB single 3.5\" HDDs today on amazon and Samsung is ready to ship its 16TB SSDs. The storage technology develops much faster than my syncthing archive. This is my particular case of course but it's totally irrational to make any assumptions about consumer fs size vs sync data size _by default_.\n\n**File system size, disk size, sync data size and minimum additional free space are orthogonal concepts which happen to have the same units and it makes no sense to measure one in units of the other.**\n\nSyncthing is the only program that I use whose settings will get screwed up when you migrate your data to another disk or expand your FS. The norm is quite simple: let the user set minimum free space _in GBs_, which defaults to a sensible value such as 1GB, and that would be the end of this, and there wouldn't be baffled users trying to make your mistake right by searching google to figure out what the heck is wrong (because surprise surprise, they actually have a lot more space than the data they're syncing) and fiddling around with obscure settings in config files, with one hand on a calculator.\n\nIt's easier to go into denial and sweep it under the rug by introducing hacky workarounds and locking to issue and forcefully silence the reporter rather than admitting that you screwed up your design choice and fixing it.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/230551723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"raichu","id":3126046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjYwNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3126046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu","html_url":"https://github.com/raichu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raichu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/230574546","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3307#issuecomment-230574546","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3307","id":230574546,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDU3NDU0Ng==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T19:15:20Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T19:15:20Z","body":"So there's a lot of vitriol here that I'm not going to comment on, I just want to note that\n\n> which defaults to a sensible value such as 1GB\n\nis more or less the reason we don't do this, as defaulting to 1GB would be a bad idea for devices with 1 GB of flash, for example.

I'm talking about the way the free space is measure, not its default value.\n\nYou don't need to measure the free space in units of file system size (which is broken in various ways as I explained above --and think about it, who else does _that_?  torrent clients? dropbox? bittorrent sync? amule? other p2p programs? I don't know where the idea originated from, but regardless, virtually all p2p file sharing programs measure minimum free space in units of bytes, not filesystem size) in order to make the default something like minimum of, say, 100MB and 5% of total space (without the minimum, there won't be an upper bound and you'd end up requiring 500GBs minimum space on a 10TB HDD).\n\n> And no, that amount of denial, sweeping, hacking and silencing sound like a lot of work compared to admitting we're wrong and fixing it.

Purpose\r\n\r\nThis deprecates the current minDiskFreePct setting and introduces minDiskFree. The latter is, in it's serialized form, a string with a unit. We accept percentages (\"2.35%\") and absolute values (\"250 k\", \"12.5 Gi\"). Common suffixes are understood. The config editor lets the user enter the string, and validates it.\r\n\r\nWe still default to \"1 %\", but the user can change that to an absolute value at will.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests on the parsing. Manual testing that the checks themselves still work.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-04-06 at 14 02 32](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/125426/24753304/cd1ae4a4-1ad1-11e7-921f-56879911d6db.png)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4087/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1039762233,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTAzOTc2MjIzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1039762233","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"da34f27546f27e5048df1175d4de1fafce6d687c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/da34f27546f27e5048df1175d4de1fafce6d687c","created_at":"2017-04-12T09:01:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1572580337,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE1NzI1ODAzMzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1572580337","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-13T07:01:22Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1572580342,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTU3MjU4MDM0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1572580342","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-13T07:01:22Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
