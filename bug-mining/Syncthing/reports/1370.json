Syncthing Version\r\nSyncthing version: v1.23.4, Linux (64-bit Intel/AMD Container)\r\n\r\n### What Happened\r\n\r\nConfiguring LDAP auth with a bind DN which omits the `%s` placeholder (to restrict login to a specific user with LDAP) results in the following bind DN being sent to LDAP:\r\n\r\nSo configuring \r\n\r\n`cn=will,dc=home,dc=internal`\r\n\r\nresults in the following being sent to the
