am not sure whether this is something recent or not, but I do not think that I had encountered anything like it before v1.11.x.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create an empty folder on Device 1.\r\n2. Add 1000 small text files to the folder on Device 1.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/98466566-a8675780-2213-11eb-8578-5c7c6b5532ac.png)\r\n3. Share the folder with 1000 files from Device 1 to Device 2.\r\n4. Accept the folder on Device 2 and let it sync.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/98466577-bc12be00-2213-11eb-8aab-f7f604d18997.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/98466578-bf0dae80-2213-11eb-8f2c-e19695e79b46.png)\r\n5. Delete the 1000 files from the folder on Device 2.\r\n6. The two folders are stuck in the following state.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/98466606-e9f80280-2213-11eb-9056-e4bfe61fae62.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/98466608-ec5a5c80-2213-11eb-95be-77fc5ee224d3.png)\r\n\r\nPlease make sure to follow the steps exactly as I have written above. If the folder was already being shared between the two devices before adding the files to it, then the synchronisation is successful. I have only managed to make this happen when the files were added to the folder in the \"Unshared\" state.\r\n\r\nRestarting Syncthing does make the folders finish the synchronisation.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7098/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
