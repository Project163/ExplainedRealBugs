Started as \"read only\" but no-one understood what is was read only against. Became \"master\" as in \"master copy\" or \"golden master\", but is still confusing for many. The config option is still called \"readOnly\". In discussions about folders that act the opposite way, \"slave\" is invariably proposed.\n\nI suggest that we should clean all this up to a terminology centered around \"changes\" (or similar) which is what happens to files or directories, and is what we synchronize between devices. We then have folders which \"send changes\" and \"receive changes\". The current \"Master\" checkbox then becomes \"Don't receive changes\", or possibly \"Only send changes\" (but the \"only\" is ambiguous there), with a help text like \"Don't receive changes to files or folders sent by other devices. Changes made locally are always sent.\" or so. The config option would be \"sendChanges\", true by default.\n\nThe \"Override\" button would become \"Overwrite remote changes\", \"Force send changes\" or something similar.\n\nPossible new folder modes would be expressed in the same terms, e.g. \"Don't send changes\" for something where we expect no local changes to happen.\n\nFeel free to bikeshed.\n\nThis changes our external API so would be a major version change.\n\nThis ticket obsoletes #1731.\n","closed_by":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2679/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
