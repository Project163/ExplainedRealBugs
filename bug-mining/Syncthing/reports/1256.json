can become completely unresponsive when GC happens. Ideally that doesn't take long (e.g. ~10s for a largish setup with DB on SSD for me), but if DB is on slow storage it takes a long time. Since https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/pull/7707 there's now at least an indication in the log that GC is happening and might render Syncthing unresponsive until it's finished.\r\n\r\nOptions to improve the situation:\r\n - Don't do db compaction. Might be a good idea anyway, considering the comment on the method at goleveldb that pretty much advises against using it.\r\n - Do most of the GC without holding the global mutex, and only acquire that for the final part when actually deleting the entries.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7722/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7722/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
