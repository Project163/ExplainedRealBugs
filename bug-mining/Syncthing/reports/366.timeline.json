did not ask if syncthing could do log rotation.\n\nI asked if syncthing's -logfile option correctly deals with logfile rotation.  i.e. if an external process does the equivalent of \"mv logfile

Or what if the logfile is truncated, does syncthing correctly append to the current file position or does it blindly assume that its cached file offset is correct?\n\nsyslog subsystems are great in theory. I can appreciate your frustration at some of these feature requests, but logging seems to be something that \"stderr piped to syslog\" seems only minimally equipped to handle. stderr is typically for errors, not general state logging.\n\nI don't want to tell you how to write your own software, but it seems pretty straightforward to write a logging subsystem that handles the logfile moving without resorting to signals and other cruft. Simply throwing out a logging capability for a process that is designed to run for long periods of time seems ... weak.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/138621294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"akohlsmith","id":474793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NDc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/474793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akohlsmith","html_url":"https://github.com/akohlsmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akohlsmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akohlsmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akohlsmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akohlsmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akohlsmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akohlsmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akohlsmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akohlsmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akohlsmith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/138623114","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2251#issuecomment-138623114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2251","id":138623114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODYyMzExNA==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-08T16:33:27Z","updated_at":"2015-09-08T16:37:12Z","body":"Right, it's a different matter then.

I use v0.11.25, Windows (64 bit). Thanks for the software... It's a great product and a big help.\n\nThe logfile sudunly become obese. Up to 45 GB. I could not delete the file (or rotate, or truncate) because syncthing has a lock on it, so I had to stop syncthing, delete the log, and start again.\n\nIs there a simple way to limit the quantity of logging produced by syncthing?\n\nThen the problem came back. I decided that I could do without log for a while, and I check the logflag. But there is no \"nolog\" option. I tried to set the the logfile to \"\" or /dev/null but it did not work. So I used the logfile=-, and it did not work also : it still created a logfile (I should mention I also use the \"no console\" option) I tried to put the logfile read-only, but then syncthing would not start. Then I removed the no-console option, and put logfile=- but it stills create a log. \n\nSo maybe there is a bug here. I launch it with wsh.Run and intWindowStyle=0, so maybe it is the lack of STDOUt that makes syncthing force log writing on default file even when I specify \"-\".\n\nSo here are a few suggestions:\n- from the web-gui: a command \"clear the log\"\n- option \"no-log\"\n- log rotation, or purge...
