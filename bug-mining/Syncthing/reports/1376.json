Everything works great. Paths to the shared directories are unified through symlinking in the home directory. However, the GUI doesn't allow entering the tilde `~` on adding folders, autoexpanding it to absolute form, thus requiring manual config editing. If entered manually, the tilde persists and creates no issues with Syncthing.\r\n\r\nAt some moment my config was changed (may be after some upgrade?) and the path was expanded to the absolute form on Windows, leading to silent creation of the directory on GNU/Linux and redownloading of the contents. I didn't notice it right away so was a bit annoyed.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the GUI didn't have this behaviour and left the `~` untouched.","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8890/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8890/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
