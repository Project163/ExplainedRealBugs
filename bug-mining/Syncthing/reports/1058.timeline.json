release changes the default location for the index database under some circumstances. Two new flags can also be used to affect the location of the configuration (`-config`) and database (`-data`) separately. The old `-home` flag is equivalent to setting both of these to the same directory. When no flags are given the following logic is used to determine the data location:\r\n\r\n- If a database exists in the old default location, that location is still used. This means existing installations are not affected by this change.\r\n- If `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is set, use `$XDG_DATA_HOME/syncthing`.\r\n- If `~/.local/share/syncthing` exists, use that location.\r\n- Use the old default location.\r\n\r\nThis logic is used on non-Windows, non-Mac platforms only. On Windows and Mac the logic is

extends the tests for intervals of the staggered versioner to cover\r\nall intervals.\r\n\r\nThis relates to github issue #6410.\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\n\r\nThis is an addition to #6410. If the tests cover all intervals, wrong intervals would be detected regardless of their notation.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nRun tests in `lib/versioner/staggered_test.go`, should be green. Modify any interval, tests should be red.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/604965716","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6410#issuecomment-604965716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6410","id":604965716,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNDk2NTcxNg==","user":{"login":"mv1005","id":49659413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NjU5NDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49659413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mv1005","html_url":"https://github.com/mv1005","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mv1005/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mv1005/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mv1005/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mv1005/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mv1005/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mv1005/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mv1005/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mv1005/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mv1005/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-27T12:10:30Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T12:10:30Z","body":"> This error would've been significantly easier to spot if this format were used:\r\n> `30 * 24 * 60 * 60`\r\n> (or by using variables for an hour, a day, etc.)\r\n\r\nAlso this error would have been detected if the tests cover all time ranges.
