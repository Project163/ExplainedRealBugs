In that\r\ncase I'd think the second version to be better from a usability\r\nperspective as this sounds closer to what the user already knows from\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonally I'd prefer this not to be a per device option, but a per\r\nfolder option really similar to the current \"out of sync UI\". This way\r\nit would look exactly the same as it does now. Only after clicking on\r\nthe \"out of sync files list\" link in the folder details we could show a\r\nsplit-screen version of the current interface with the local state on\r\nthe left and the remote state on the right. On devices which are too\r\nnarrow we could have two tabs for local and remote.\r\n\r\nAs this would be identical to what we do now, just with a second tab or\r\nthe local list on the left and the remote one on the right I'd imagine\r\nit to be exactly the same file-based list with several devices and only\r\nfiles as it is now.\r\n\r\nThis way we'd have only minimal divergence from the current workflow and\r\nno further UI clutter inside the device details.\r\n\r\nTo me it'd be confusing if the local out of sync UI would stay\r\nfolder-based while the remote UI could only be found inside the device\r\ndetails and would look different, because we would have to create a\r\nsecond decision layer for the folders.\r\n\r\nIf you prefer this to be device-based I don't really grasp the upside of\r\ndoing something different than what we do now. The only argument I can\r\nthink of is that it'd be easier to see which devices are \"making\r\ntrouble\", maybe because they have a slower network/internet connection\r\nthan others. But then one could argue the same for the current local OOS UI.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like, I could create a mockup of what I described. But\r\nessentially everything would be the same with either two lists or two\r\ntabs to switch between the local and remote

I get that the information in the folder details currently displays only the local state and the info in the device tab is about the remote device not beeing in sync. \r\n\r\nI'm just trying to think of the most intuitive way to present both. Because the local status is folder based and the remote status is device based we'd have to \"reinvent the wheel\" because we need to create a second logical layer indicating the status of all folders connected to the device (which is what you proposed two different ways for). \r\n\r\n@AudriusButkevicius Well, the same could be said about having not just two different places to look for information on an \"out of sync\" status, especially because we'd also be forced to create a different logic to order by folder. Which is something new each user has to learn/adapt to. But you certainly have a point. Also showing a red \"out of sync\" message inside the folder if only on one of maybe 200 remote devices is out of sync would lower the urgency of the out of sync messages in the folders, because most of the time the local version would be perfectly fine. I'll get to that in my last paragraph.\r\n\r\nSo IF we went with my proposal, it would be important to make clear on first sight that only remote devices are out of sync and locally everything is a-ok. The most intuitive way I can think of is to show a green \"out of sync\" message in the folder when only remote devices are affected. As soon as the local folder is out of sync, the current red \"out of sync\" message would be shown.\r\n\r\nThis way the users wouldn't be alarmed when only remote devices are affected, so the urgency of local OOS messages is retained. And one wouldn't have to take a second look to grasp the different ordering types (by device or by folder). Also the specific devices which are \"troublemakers\" are easily identifiable (but not linking to the OOS interface) on the right.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nedit: accidentally swapped local and remote in one sentence; clarified that I wouldn't change anything on the right.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/346956985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"generalmanager","id":6797943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTc5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6797943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager","html_url":"https://github.com/generalmanager","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1357906694,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTM1NzkwNjY5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1357906694","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-25T18:15:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1357906695,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEzNTc5MDY2OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1357906695","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-25T18:15:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1357906696,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTM1NzkwNjY5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1357906696","actor":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017
