We currently have about 18 different languages. So the list might be long. Any guides/idas towards a relevant component? This one seems to be pretty good fit for the job: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-select\n3. Where shall we save the selected language? Shall we save it as \"per user\" setting in the browser or as \"per node\" setting put it via ajax to an api endpoint?

javascript UI.\n\nRegarding 2, I guess it's enough to have a plain dropdown, but there is quite a few languages, so having stuff appear as you type is quite cool, and could be reused by the 'Path to folder' thing, so if we can get people to lay a foundation for some reusable stuff, why not.\n\nRegarding 1, don't care too much, but I was thinking that we eventually could have a `about:config` like
