Both Windows and Linux have the SyncThing config folder symbolically linked to a folder on a shared partition.\n\nThe synced folder is also being linked to on Linux and Windows each with a symbolic link ~/SyncedFolder.\n\nOn Windows this is parsed with no issue. On Linux this does not work with an error saying the symbolic link is not a folder. The error does not occur if the full home path is specified - e.g. /home/username/SyncedFolder.\n\nSo issue seems to stem when parsing ~ when the destination folder is a symbolic link to the synced folder. The full error is \"/home/username/SyncedFolder: not a directory\" when the path specified is ~/SyncedFolder. I've confirmed that the symbolic link was set up correctly under Linux.\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2782/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
