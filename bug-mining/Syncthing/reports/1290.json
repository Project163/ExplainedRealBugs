It seems like it doesn't generate events when changing file mode, which means permissions don't get synced after running `chmod` until the next scan.\r\n\r\nI've done a tiny bit of digging and it looks like those events should be generated by FSEvents. The`fsnotify` package, which uses `kqueue` instead of `FSEvents`, does seem to emit `chmod` events.\r\n\r\nVersion: Syncthing v1.18.1-1 macos\r\nOS: macOS BigSur x64 11.5.2\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n\r\n* Have a synced folder\r\n* Create a file\r\n* Change file permissions using `chmod`\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n* File permissions are not synced until next scan or until file is modified e.g by `touch`ing it\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n\r\n* File permissions will be synced after `fsWatchDelay`\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7924/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7924/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
