It might work if you pass the magic \"local device\" device ID, but I'm not sure. It's probably guaranteed not to work if you pass your actual device ID or no device ID at all. I'm guessing the response you see is simply the result for an unknown device - it has no bytes, so everything is needed and completion is 0%.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the `status` API call is the right one, working as you guessed.\r\n\r\nWe could have a more straightforward API call though. I'm yet undecided. :)\r\n\r\nThe one thing that we *are* definitely lacking is a simple API endpoint to answer if the entire device is in sync or not, not just a specific folder. This becomes relevant when there are thousands of folders, as it's thousands of expensive API calls to figure that out today.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/540153170/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/540168703","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6075#issuecomment-540168703","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6075","id":540168703,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MDE2ODcwMw==","user":{"login":"supersexy","id":11744844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzQ0ODQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11744844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersexy","html_url":"https://github.com/supersexy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersexy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersexy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersexy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersexy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersexy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersexy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersexy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersexy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/supersexy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-09T20:06:39Z","updated_at":"2019-10-09T20:06:39Z","body":"Thanks for the hint about the device id, was not clear that this is not optional.
