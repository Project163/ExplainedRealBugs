Once I remove the files on the source end the prefixes are removed but the empty files with the same name that was on the source end remains. \n\nThis happened to me last week but I did not realize how until I ran this test. I copied a lot of pictures from my camera to my desktop. They were syncing while I went through the pictures. I deleted the ones that I did not want to keep on my desktop. Later I noticed a lot of empty files on my laptop. Because all of the file names look the same I was not sure if they were the ones I had deleted on the desktop. Now it seems clear that they were ready to sync when I deleted them and the empty file was left behind.\n\nThe error on the web interface is:\n10:11:29: Folder \"ST\" isn't making progress - check logs for possible root cause. Pausing puller for 1m0s.\n\nThe console error is:\n[xxxxx] 10:12:30 INFO: Puller (folder \"ST\", dir \"MB\"): delete: remove /Test/ST/MB: directory not empty\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"Do you have a custom number of copier routines?\".\n\nThe second issue is a lot trickier. I had not submitted a an issue report because I'm not sure how to handle it. Automatically deleting ignored files on either end is not a good idea since whey may have started there and you just don't want to sync them. I guess ideally the interface would provide more useful information, not just \"isn't making progress\". The logs, which don't exist unless you pipe the output somewhere, aren't very specific. It actually points to the base directory, not even the one that has the empty (or ignored) files in it. It would help if the logs named the files that are blocking the directory removal and mentioned that the files that are left behind are in the .stignore list. Ideally the web interface would tell you exactly what is left behind, mentioned that the only files left behind are in the .stignore list and asked you if they should be deleted.\n\nConsider this case:\n\nI have directory DirA with files File1.txt File2.txt. I sync it between 2 computers. Then I decide I don't want to sync File2.txt so I add it to .stignore.\n\nA week later I decide to rename DirA to DirB. On the other computer I get a new directory named DirB with File1.txt in it and I still have DirA with File2.txt in it.\n\nOn the receiving end the web interface tells me it's not making progress, check the logs. The console output tells me it can't delete DirA because it's not empty.\n\nAutomatically deleting directory DirA could lead to problems, syncing File2.txt to the new location violates the .stignore settings so neither makes sense. If there was a way to recognize the special case where syncthing is trying to delete a directory that is not empty and the only files left in the directories are also in the .stignore file and give an option to delete them from the web interface that might work.\n\nThis happened to me several times because I noticed lots of files syncing that were never going to be needed on the other end. I think I have 6 file names that are no longer synced but were originally synced to many of the directories on the other computer. (i.e. desktop.ini). Any time I rename, relocate, remove a directory with any of these files in it syncthing has a problem. A quick find command cleans up the mess but it would be nice if it was easier.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/70381407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CoupeWare","id":9490727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTA3Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9490727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare","html_url":"https://github.com/CoupeWare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/70382272","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1263#issuecomment-70382272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1263","id":70382272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwMzgyMjcy","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-17T20:08:27Z","updated_at":"2015-01-17T20:08:27Z","body":"I don't think 2nd issue will ever be fixed as there is no good way of fixing it.\nOffering to delete some random files which we are not even supposed to see doesn't make a lot of sense.\nPlus, if you choose not to delete the files the problem persists still requiring manual intervention.\nYou do bring the problem upon yourself to be honest, as it's your choice to ignore these files, hence it's your responsibility to manage them because they are not managed by syncthing.\n\nWe do plan to eventually scrap ignores in favour of selective sync, where you select which directories to sync oppose to which file extensions, so I guess this sort of could solve the issue as you might not even be able to ignore anything.\n\nBack to the first issue, syncthing does not 'pre-create' files, it only creates them at the point it starts writing to them.

I only mentioned it because it has something in common with my main issue. I will setup a test and try it on both syncthing and btsync and see if it behaves any differently.\n\nWhen you scrap .stingore will there still be a way to block syncing based on file name? This is a must have feature for me since there are many temporary files that I never want to sync.\n\nI have reproduced the problem several times. it happened with the pictures last weekend and I recreated after your first reply.\n\nOddly enough I just tried again with a new file tree and it did not happen. What actually happens is only one .syncthing.FILENAME is created while it's being synced. Right after I move the files out of the source directory all of the remaining .syncthing.FILENAME are created with zero size and then they are gone.\n\nThe only difference between this and the earlier tests was the number of directories. In the earlier test the files were 2 directories deep, in the test that worked they were 1 directory deep.\n\nSo I added another directory. It did the same thing at first, only one .syncthing.FILENAME file at a time, then it created the missing .syncthing.FILENAME files after they were deleted on the source but this time they stayed zero size and were renamed FILENAME.\n\nI have copied the ls outputs below.\n\nI am running tests many different ways and I'm seeing different results. Sometimes I have zero size files left and sometimes I don't. In one of my tests I've added a second copy of the files in a second directory 2 deep.\n\nIn one case I have ST/Dir1/BMC with 10 50MB files.\n\nIn the other case I have ST/Dir2/BMC1 and ST/Dir2/BMC2 each with 10 50 MB files.\n\nDirectory ST in the shared directory.\n\nI have not looked at the code and have never worked with Go so these are user observations.\n\nWhen the files are being synced one .syncthing.FILENAME exists. soon after the source files disappear the reaming .syncthing.FILENAME are created as if a loop was just waiting for the first one to complete and instead of existing it quickly made the remaining .syncthing.FILENAME files. \n\nIn the case when there are two directories two deep in the file system the files get renamed FILENAME and they are left behind.\n\nIn the case when there are two directories two deep in the file system the first temporary file to be synced in the second directory (.syncthing.FILENAME) is created along with the remaining .syncthing.FILENAME files int he first directory and then they are all deleted properly.\n\nI will keep testing to make sure this is consistent.

This is for 2 directories 2 deep (Dir2/BMC1 & DIR2/BMC2). I created 10 MB brick files in BMC1 and 20 MB brick files in BMC2 so it's easier to see which are which in the ls output.\n\nI am continuing to run this test and sometimes it works as expected and sometimes it leave zero size files behind. So far changing the paths or having 2 sub folders does not guarantee results either way. My best guess is that it depends on when during the sync process the source files disappear. I have noticed that the next .syncthing.FILEBANE file appears right before the one being synced finished syncing (the file is slightly less than the final size) so maybe that timing or some other timing is part of the problem. You can see this happen in the ls output below. .syncthing.BRICK-010MB-002 is not quite done but .syncthing.BRICK-010MB-003 has been created.\n\nDuring

have run dozens of tests at this point and the only thing I can tell you is that sometimes Syncthing works as expected and sometimes it leaves empty files behind. I have tried to figure out what is different between the tests and it's hard to see a pattern.\n\nI have generated hundreds of files with random data in them to try to figure out when the files are left behind and then they are not. I have put them in many different file structures to see if that matters. All of my test files work some times and fail at other times. I can try the same directories and files 3 times in a row and some times works all 3 times and sometimes it fails 1, 2 or all 3 times.\n\nI have set the rescan interval on both ends to 6000 seconds so that I can control the rescans. It does not seem to matter which system (sending or receiving) rescans first. It can work or fail either way. I have also tried moving the files out of the Syncthing test folder early in the sync process (during the first file sync) and later int he process and it makes no difference.\n\nI have tried to see if rescanning the source server before I get the puller pausing error on the receiving server matters but it's hard to be sure since I can't control when the error takes place.\n\nThe only test that always fails is when I move a bunch of MP3 files into the test directory and then move it out before the sync is done. Every time I do that some empty files are left behind along with the directory structure. The MP3 directory has about 1200 files and folders in it.\n\nThere appears to be some variable in my actions that I can not track down. This is the definition of insanity because the best I can tell I'm doing the same thing over and over and getting different results and it is making me insane.\n\nAs I recall when I first ran into this problem several months Syncthing left behind zero size files on the receiving server for every file that was queued up to sync but had not finished syncing. Now what I am finding is that not all files that have not synced are being left behind as empty files. When my test fails on the same batch of files more than once it leaves a different set of empty files behind. When the batch of files includes copies of the same files in different folders (to see if the number of files matters) syncthing was able to sync the secondary copies of any file that had completed syncing one copy even after the source files were no longer available. This syncing without the source continues until the source server rescans. Pretty cool bandwidth saving feature but could that code be involved in this bug? My conclusion in January was that the empty files were only left behind the first time a batch of files was synced and disappeared before they were done. Subsequent syncs where the files disappeared were handled properly. It's not that easy to reproduce now so something appears to have changed to partially fix the old cause.\n\nIt's been a while since I first reported this bug and it seems like it's better than it was. I think I've seen it return the empty files from the receiving server to the sending server in the past and I have not seen that happen with 0.11.05.\n\nGood luck figuring this out and let me know if you want me to run an additional tests.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/104001616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CoupeWare","id":9490727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTA3Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9490727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare","html_url":"https://github.com/CoupeWare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/104006863","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1263#issuecomment-104006863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1263","id":104006863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwNDAwNjg2Mw==","user":{"login":"CoupeWare","id":9490727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTA3Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9490727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare","html_url":"https://github.com/CoupeWare","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CoupeWare/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-20T19:30:46Z","updated_at":"2015-05-20T19:30:46Z","body":"I just ran one more test.
