So, I wondered whether [that label](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/gui/default/index.html#L335) could be upgraded with [the `Edit | Ignore Patterns` button's functionality](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/gui/default/syncthing/folder/editFolderModalView.html#L196) just to shave off that one click from the current click path.\r\n\r\nI've not done a lot of publishable HTML or JavaScript, but this seems to me like an easy hack. Would a GUI tweak that hyperlinks the label, or introduces a small button besides it be welcome?
