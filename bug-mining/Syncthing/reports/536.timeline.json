so I gave some more thought on that, stared a lot into journalctl (on Fedora) and here are my notes:\n-  The \"recent\" milestone could have been the last boot, Tuesday afternoon. Most files that were preserved I'm sure I have edited after that. I remember editing gnucash data file soon  after boot to Fedora, and that file was preserved as well (too bad I did not save list of preserved files).\n-  The laptop was suspended (systemctl suspend) at least two times since that.\n-  The moment when things seem to go bad is: after resume from last suspend, on Sun 03:33, I updated and restarted the Fedora's syncthing using WUI.

Soon after that, things go bad: those paths mentioned in the \"Puller\" messages are already _partially_ gone. These \"mismatching\" messages also appear on VPS; although here they also appear few hours later with another v0.14.3 device, but data here did not get wiped.\n\nNote that since that incident, the state is still Out Of Sync, due to 6 folders. Other than that, it appears to function normally.
