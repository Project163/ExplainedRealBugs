could be done, but requires some integration around discovery and maybe some protocol extension to handle some aspects of. In rough terms, I could envision it like this, given two devices A and B and a relay R;\n- A connects to R\n- R sets up a listening port that is specific to A, and announces this to the announce server\n- B looks up A in the announce server, and gets the address to the above port on R\n- B connects to R\n- R shuffles bytes to and fro so that A talks directly to B\n\nMaybe, possibly, this could be done without any changes by just writing up R correctly. It can't respond to A when it connects, because it has no (correct) certificate to offer, so probably A will timeout and reconnect repeatedly. This may be fine.\n\nThe first step (\"A connects to R\") would need to be either by manual configuration or something else, since R hasn't announced for B at that

The proxy could be simple enough to just tie two incoming TCP connections together. The problem you run into is mentioned above - the TLS negotiation isn't symmetric, so two syncthing's both connecting out won't be able to talk to each other, one of them should play the \"server\" role (accepting the connection). This could be worked around by a config on syncthing to switch the roles around, i.e. connect out to the proxy but from a TLS point of view pretend the connection was incoming. In that scenario one of the devices need to be aware that there is a proxy involved and be configured to play the server role; the other device would not need to know and would just connect to the proxy as usual.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/86210295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":265176615,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjY1MTc2NjE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/265176615","actor":{"login":"tacoadventure","id":11618718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjE4NzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11618718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure","html_url":"https://github.com/tacoadventure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-25T20:46:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":265176616,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2NTE3NjYxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/265176616","actor":{"login":"tacoadventure","id":11618718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjE4NzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11618718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure","html_url":"https://github.com/tacoadventure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-25T20:46:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/86227178","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1364#issuecomment-86227178","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/1364","id":86227178,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MjI3MTc4","user":{"login":"tacoadventure","id":11618718,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjE4NzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11618718?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure","html_url":"https://github.com/tacoadventure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tacoadventure/received_events","type":"User

had something that worked, but it was of questionable value because it basically allowed connections to hosts, but it required a host that it could already connect to (making the relay kind of pointless). What is really needed, I think, is a global relay system, or the ability to allow others to relay via someone else (a non-trusted device, basically). The problem with this method is that it opened up a number of security issues that could have allowed spammers to basically get an open relay via a syncthing device. I was working on a method to verify syncthing hosts before creating the relay, but I started making a new protocol for verification, which I don't think would be a welcome change when it could be added to the standard protocol.
