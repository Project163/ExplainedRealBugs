For example, the Rust project has been fighting such issues for a few years now: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86470\r\n\r\nThe official Rust documentation has the following statement on this topic:\r\n\r\n> [Monotonicity](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html#monotonicity)\r\n> \r\n> On all platforms Instant will try to use an OS API that guarantees monotonic behavior if available, which is the case for all [tier 1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support.html) platforms. In practice such guarantees are – under rare circumstances – broken by hardware, virtualization or operating system bugs. To work around these bugs and platforms not offering monotonic clocks [duration_since](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html#method.duration_since), [elapsed](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html#method.elapsed) and [sub](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html#method.sub) saturate to zero. In older Rust versions this lead to a panic instead. [checked_duration_since](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/time/struct.Instant.html#method.checked_duration_since) can be used to detect and handle situations where monotonicity is violated, or Instants are subtracted in the wrong order.\r\n> \r\n> This workaround obscures programming errors where earlier and later instants are accidentally swapped. For this reason future rust versions may reintroduce panics.\r\n\r\nThus, I think the right thing to do is to just always assume that time may progress backwards and handle such cases appropriately.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/1731687382/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GermanCoding","id":4279661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNzk2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4279661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding","html_url":"https://github.com/GermanCoding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GermanCoding/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10657474556,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs5xcmq8zwAAAAJ7PCf8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/10657474556","actor":{"login":"claraphyll","id":22559310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTU5MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22559310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/claraphyll","html_url":"https://github.com/claraphyll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claraphyll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claraphyll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claraphyll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claraphyll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claraphyll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claraphyll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claraphyll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claraphyll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/claraphyll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"917698d8c7950f5b115e8efcfa9d98dff588908a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/claraphyll/syncthing/commits/917698d8c7950f5b115e8efcfa9d98dff588908a","created_at":"2023-10-15T11:29:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11619813225,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs5xcmq8zwAAAAK0mEdp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/11619813225","actor":{"login":"AndiDog","id":1376043,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzYwNDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1376043?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndiDog","html_url":"https://github.com/AndiDog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndiDog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndiDog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndiDog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndiDog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndiDog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndiDog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndiDog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndiDog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndiDog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"051cbdc71339ddf9c49b58a32e172718cf76a67b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AndiDog/syncthing/commits/051cbdc71339ddf9c49b58a32e172718cf76a67b","created_at":"2024-01-28T12:19:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14329084457,"node_id":"LE_lADOAOCAEs5xcmq8zwAAAANWFHop","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/14329084457","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.c
