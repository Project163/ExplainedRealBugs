In this case, a little explanation can go a long way.\n\n@canton7 Jup, a link with an empty recipient would be the easiest method. In that case the user still has to interact with the newly opened UI to enter the recipient. If we could bootstrap this so that everything apart from hitting \"send\" is taken care of, people would probably even want to use the feature.\n\nI also really like the custom URL scheme from a usability perspective. It also makes phishing-attacks very easy tough.

The fact that it is a syncthing device id is of course fine to mention. But any explanatory text about how to use it is equally likely to be wrong since we know nothing about the recipient setup\n\nOne question: do you want to exclude any Information apart from the ID and \"this is a Syncthing ID\" or just the usage tutorial, which might be misleading in non-default setups?\n\nI don't want to fight about this, it's your project and you can obviously develop it however you like. But I'd like to explain why I think it's a good idea to help the possible user in this way. Obviously we should note that the information is only correct if they haven't changed the defaults. If the recipient has heard of ST before and set it up themselves, just the ID and a minimal explanation what to do with it would be enough.\nIf it's longer tough usability studies have shown that people simply ignore/skip over information which doesn't affect them without having negative feelings.\n\nBut in the case where the recipient doesn't have much information, e.g. when two or more people have agreed to share some files with each other and one of them told them about Syncthing, it's probably going to be the guy/girl who sent them the mail. But until this point they probably don't have much information apart from maybe having heard the name and that it's a good tool. IMHO this is a good time to give them the eagles view of the project and to point them to places where they can find more information if they are interested or having trouble getting it setup.\n\n> And just mailing a device id out of the blue to someone who has never heard of syncthing is likely to be either confusing or interpreted as a phishing attempt anyway. \n\nTo avoid confusion, more information us generally more helpful than less information. From my experience the average user doesn't even know what phishing is or that it exists. I'd have a lot less work if they did. Those who do know enough about technology to fear phishing probably also don't need much help to get ST set up. The others only delete/ignore mails because they think it's spam. But those are generally accustomed to this kind of mail, because of similar emails from dropbox and other services as well as the familiar sender address. I don't think we have to fear beeing misinterpreted as spam. If people don't know from context what to do with this ID, they might ignore/delete it tough because they don't see why it's not spam.\n\nThe easier it is to familiarize oneself with a tool and the easier it is to use, the more people will benefit from it.\n\n> Also, it's one more thing to translate into every language, which is simpler if it's short and to the point.\n\nTrue, but there is generally not that much text in ST compared to other projects I've helped translate. Signal e.g. is much worse and translations are updated so quickly that 5 minutes after receiving the notification it's probably been done by someone else. I also volunteer to translate it into German ;-)\n\nTL;DR: It's your project, but I think a little more information than \"this is abc's ID: XXXXXX...\" would be nice. Shouldn't be too long tough. The localhost:xxxx link could also go, because it's seriously confusing if the mail is opened on an android phone with the app installed.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/183669146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"generalmanager","id":6797943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTc5NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6797943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager","html_url":"https://github.com/generalmanager","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/generalmanager/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/183977025","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2771#issuecomment-183977025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2771","id":183977025,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Mzk3NzAyNQ==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-14T21:04:02Z","updated_at":"2016-02-14T21:04:02Z","body":"I think a couple of sentences about what it is (this is a device ID for syncthing; syncthing syncs files; device IDs allow devices to connect and share files; ...) and a link to an actual documentation article describing how to add the device would be appropriate. That documentation should be part of the getting started guide, which surely needs some love, and linking it there would also give the user a path forward towards learning more. I'm not really sure what's the best way to cover this for when the user runs Android or something only and any syncthing \"core\" docs are going to be misleading at best... Maybe a note that the instructions are for the common case but they may need to check with their actual app / distribution / packaging / whatever.\n\nIn the end, it's not something I'm going to fight
