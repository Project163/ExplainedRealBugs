This is a repo that I have been syncing for 6+ months without issue, but is now (with 0.14.16) failing. I cannot say for certain if 0.14.16 is the cause or if it was 0.14.14 or 15 as I haven't done a checkout of this particular branch for about a week prior to today. \r\n\r\nI currently see 27 items (a mix of files and directories) \"unable to sync\" due to a missing parent directory. Here is a sample screenshot from the UI with filenames scrambled.\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2016-12-23 18-34-47](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/56076/21464855/3581d032-c93f-11e6-92a3-68c9531d69ba.png)\r\n\r\nLooking at the paths the directories are all sub-directories of a (missing) parent directory, and the files are contained in those sub-directories, so that might be an indication of where the issue is. Also of note is that all of the indicated files and directories are not currently present on either machine. I had switched to a branch, then switched back while the failing machine was offline. The syncing machine state _should_ be a no-op actually because it's state matches that of the remote. I should note that I experienced the exact same thing on another machine and \"fixed\" it by switching branches directly on that machine.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n- Syncthing completes sync of all non-existent directories once offline machine is reconnected\r\n\r\nI will try to get a reproduction script together, but it may take a little bit of time to pull off. Happy to run any suggested diagnostics on the failing machine. I seem to be running into all the syncthing bugs lately after 6+ months of worry-free use :-/\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.16\r\nOS Version: Arch Linux (x64)\r\nBrowser Version: N/A\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3839/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3839/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
