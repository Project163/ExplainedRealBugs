is a long-standing problem that I have experienced multiple times, but only now I have managed to reproduce it.\r\n\r\n1. On Device 1, create a new folder called `test1`.\r\n2. In the folder `test1`, create a folder called `1`.\r\n3. In the folder `1`, create a file called `1`.\r\n3. On Device 2, create a new folder called `test2`.\r\n4. In the folder `test2`, create a folder called `2`.\r\n5. In the folder `2`, create a file called `2`.\r\n\r\nThe first steps are done on the file system level, not in Syncthing.\r\n\r\n5. On Device 1, add the `test1` folder to Syncthing, and share it with Device 2.\r\n6. On Device 2, accept the folder as SR, pointing it at the `test2` folder.\r\n7. The contents of the two folders have been merged and synced.\r\n\r\n   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/119250145-fe608300-bbd8-11eb-819e-f3f1233b1a5f.png)\r\n   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5626656/119250148-002a4680-bbd9-11eb-9cdd-9ebaa7cbd863.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n8.
