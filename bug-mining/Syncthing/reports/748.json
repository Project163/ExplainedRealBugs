There are valid localhost addresses that are failing this test.  For example, 127.5.6.7.  In fact 127.0.0.0/8 is defined as being local to the machine.\r\n\r\nMy use case is this:\r\n\r\nTo avoid more and more obscure local port forwarding when I SSH to a remote box (e.g. ssh -L 28384:localhost:8384), I put specific localhost entries in /etc/hosts, such as\r\n    127.5.6.7 myremotehost.lo \r\nand then I can put this in my ~/.ssh/config:\r\n    Host myremotehost.com\r\n        LocalForward myremotehost.lo:8384 localhost:8384\r\nand then navigate to\r\n    http://myremotehost.lo:8384\r\n\r\nThis breaks because addressIsLocalHost() doesn't think 127.5.6.7 is a valid local host, and I get the Host Check Error.\r\n\r\nI can disable the check, but that weakens security.  It would be better to have the function fixed.\r\n\r\nI'm not a Go programmer.  I can see in GitHub where the code is called, and where the test function is.  Perhaps it's a standard library function.  I tried googling and searching the golang API site, but I can't find it.  Sorry I can't be more help.\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.32\r\nOS Version: Debian 7\r\nBrowser Version: Firefox 58.0.2 (Ubuntu)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4815/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
