I considered two options to solve this:\r\n\r\n1. Just mark everything as needed when the global version changes from invalid to valid. Problems:  \r\nWhether an item is needed is then based on transient information. When the item changes in the future, it's not clear whether it was needed or not before -> messed up accounting.  \r\nAnd even worse: We'd then need more special cases in the puller: It needs to handle pulling stuff that we don't actually need (e.g. locally changed item is then suddenly needed, but we shouldn't actually override that with the global).  \r\nA no-go.\r\n2. Add a new local invalid flag `FlagLocalGlobalInvalid` and consider needed when that flag is set and the global is valid, regardless of version. Works, but means that we either need to do an additional file info lookup when updating a local file or store that local flag in the global version list. Seems doable, but still means lots of complexity.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/829481006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/829482315","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7608#issuecomment-829482315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7608","id":829482315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTQ4MjMxNQ==","user":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-29T18:16:09Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T18:16:09Z","body":"I
