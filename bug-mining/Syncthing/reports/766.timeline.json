Purpose\r\n\r\nSince #4095 folder roots are created for paused folders, which isn't desirable (#4903) - don't do that anymore. To keep the ability to set ignore patterns on paused folders (#4094), check and create the folder root when setting ignore patterns. Folder marker wasn't touched before and isn't touched now, so that safety mechanism wasn't/isn't jeopardized.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nAdd tests for both #4903 and #4094.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4904/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/384252483","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4903#issuecomment-384252483","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4903","id":384252483,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDI1MjQ4Mw==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-25T11:21:13Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T11:21:13Z","body":"This
