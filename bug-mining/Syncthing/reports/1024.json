This limits Syncthing's peak RAM usage when there are many connected devices all requesting file data. The default is 256 MiB.\r\n\r\n- The config option maxConcurrentScans has been removed and replaced a new config option maxFolderConcurrency. In addition to just limiting concurrent scans it now also limits concurrent sync operations. The default is the number of available CPU threads (\"GOMAXPROCS\").\r\n\r\n- Syncthing now always runs the monitor process, which previously was disabled with -no-restart. This facilitates crash reporting and makes logging behave more consistently. The observed behavior with -no-restart should be the same as before but the internals differ.\r\n\r\n- The database schema has been improved and will result in a migration plus compaction at first startup after the upgrade.\r\n","creator":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":53,"state":"closed","created_at":"2020-01-16T06:48:10Z","updated_at":"2020-03-17T06:20:59Z","due_on":"2020-03-17T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2020-03-17T06:20:59Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2018-02-25T07:39:10Z","updated_at":"2021-01-20T07:03:08Z","closed_at":"2020-01-20T08:07:47Z","author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"When run in a subshell, on Linux, i.e.\r\n\r\n```\r\njb@acro:~ $ cat run.sh \r\n#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\nsyncthing -no-browser -no-restart\r\n\r\njb@acro:~ $ ./run.sh \r\n```\r\n\r\nSyncthing won't get and exit due to a Ctrl-C. If the last line is `exec syncthing ...` it's all good as then there is no intermediate shell.\r\n\r\nAnother workaround is to *not* use `-no-restart`, as the monitor process will then handle this correctly, getting the Ctrl-C and passing the signal to its child. And honestly this is the expected way to run when running \"interactively\" anyway.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the process group juggling in c554ffcc, 91210cbb, c2119c9e. The controlling terminal sends the signal to the foreground process group, which in this case is just bash (as we move away into our own process group). \r\n\r\nBSD, Mac, etc don't suffer from this as they have sane thread implementations where we don't need to do tricks with the process group.\r\n\r\nA potential \"fix\" could be to have the monitor process do this instead, by using runtime.LockOSThread, setting the niceness for the current thread, then syscall.ForkExec to spawn the real syncthing from that thread, inheriting the priority. I'm not very fond of moving stuff into the monitor.\r\n\r\nOr we could just remove the hack and tell Linux users to set the niceness themselves. Or maybe just let this be a known issue forever.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/4774/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
