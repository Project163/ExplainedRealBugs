My bad.  I have reread your earlier explanation and now it makes sense.  I agree with you that 'on all devices' is misleading.  However, I would guess that more complex situations could cause this same error, eg. where the directory is not empty on either device, but only some of its contents match an ignore pattern on one of those devices.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the OP has solved his particular problem by brute force, but would have liked a more descriptive/helpful error message to help him solve it more quickly.  I can't imagine this particular scenario occurs very often!\r\n\r\nAfter some deliberation, I think what is needed to make this clearer is to express in the error message what syncthing *wants* to do (ie. delete the directory), as well as why it can't.  For example :\r\n\r\n'Directory has been deleted on a synced device but won't be automatically deleted here as some contents match an ignore pattern on other device.  Please check directory contents and delete it manually.'\r\n\r\nNot sure if 'please... delete it manually' should be there, as I presume there are other possible solutions that may be better depending on user intent (eg. editing the ignore patterns and letting the directory re-sync back to the device where it was deleted).

locally.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/620172082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"arpie42","id":1161269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjEyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1161269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42","html_url":"https://github.com/arpie42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3277177126,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI3NzE3NzEyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/3277177126","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-27T19:00:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3277177127,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNzcxNzcxMjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/3277177127","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-27T19:00:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/620263272","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6575#issuecomment-620263272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6575","id":620263272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDI2MzI3Mg==","user":{"login":"arpie42","id":1161269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjEyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1161269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42","html_url":"https://github.com/arpie42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-27T22:12:29Z","updated_at":"2020-04-27T22:12:29Z","body":"@imsodin Yes, you're quite right.  My bad.  I have reread your earlier explanation and now it makes sense.  I agree with you that 'on all devices' is misleading.  However, I would guess that more complex situations could cause this same error, eg. where the directory is not empty on either device, but only some of its contents match an ignore pattern on one of those devices.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the OP has solved his particular problem by brute force, but would have liked a more descriptive/helpful error message to help him solve it more quickly.  I can't imagine this particular scenario occurs very often!\r\n\r\nAfter some consideration, I think what is needed to make this clearer is to express in the error message what syncthing *wants* to do (ie. delete the directory), as well as why it can't.  For example :\r\n\r\n'Directory has been deleted on a synced device but won't be automatically deleted here as some contents match an ignore pattern on other device.'\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/620263272/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"arpie42","id":1161269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjEyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1161269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42","html_url":"https://github.com/arpie42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpie42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3277810299,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI3NzgxMDI5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/3277810299","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-27T22:12:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3277810301,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyNzc4MTAzMDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/3277810301","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-27T22:12:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3281229525,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMyODEyMjk1MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/3281229525","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a88e52320edda32dfe45f950c94b3559987156cd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imsodin/syncthing/commits/a88e52320edda32dfe45f950c94b3559987156cd","created_at":"2020-04-28T16:50:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3281232781,"node_id
