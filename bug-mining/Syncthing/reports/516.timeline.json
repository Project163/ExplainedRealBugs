build-process builds for `linux` and not for `android`, causing a crash, since the delta-index feature requires a temporary directory. (See also #706).\n\nI have added the `TMPDIR` environment variable, pointed it to the application's \"cache\" directory, this seems to be working quite well.\n\nStill I'd like someone else to have a
