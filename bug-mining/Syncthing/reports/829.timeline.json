It does not matter that the icons are exactly the same, just that fork-awesome provide icons with similar meanings under the same names so that it is easy to migrate from one to the other.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would want to be able to use fork-awesome in place of font-awesome v5 with no changes to the code and get reasonable results.\r\n\r\nFor example, fork-awesome could support the fas, fab and far prefixes alongside with the classic v4 prefixes.\r\n\r\nLet me add some context so that you understand where I am coming from.\r\n\r\nFontawesome is a very popular Debian package (tens of thousands of installs). As Debian Developers, we are faced with the issue that fontawesome v5 has a non-free build system and is therefore not fit for inclusion in Debian. This is unfortunate because there are a bunch of great Debian apps that are migrating to Fontawesome v5. We are left with no fonts for these apps.\r\n\r\nIf fork-awesome was compatible with fontawesome v5, we could use fork-awesome in these apps. We would probably also try to convince fontawesome users to switch to fork-awesome in the longer term.\r\n\r\nSee the relevant Debian bug: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=902981\r\n\r\nOur discussion with upstream: https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/issues/13467\r\n\r\nfork-awesome could be the saviour we have been hoping for ;)\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ForkAwesome/Fork-Awesome/issues/112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ForkAwesome/Fork-Awesome/issues/112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/426398032","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5236#issuecomment-426398032","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5236","id":426398032,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjM5ODAzMg==","user":{"login":"aviau","id":2706882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDY4ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2706882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviau","html_url":"https://github.com/aviau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aviau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-02T19:20:04Z","updated_at":"2018-10-02T19:20:04Z","body":"Great.

I felt happy and accomplished.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![screenshot from 2018-10-02

name found [here](https://forkawesome.github.io/Fork-Awesome/icons/).\r\n\r\nI only had to rename the refresh icons since fork-awesome supports most of the v5 names when you include the compat css
