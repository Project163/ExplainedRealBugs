They don't appear to be stored in the database, thus the global version seems to have a change time of 0 and won't trigger a rescan.

have installed Syncthing (v1.29.2) on two Macs (absolutely running macOS). What I encountered is that files are continuously syncing, never stopping. I read this issue and turned \"Sync Extended Attributes\" off, and it soon showed me \"Up to Date\". I tested in a separate folder (both in internal and external disks, respectively, including only one file) and confirmed that the issue exists. Here, the only file synced almost every 10 seconds and the \"File Created Time\" was only showed on the device where it was created. In other words, it seemed like that attribute never really synced, causing a difference being noticed by the watcher and showing a 10 seconds interval between every sync.\n\nHowever, things seems to be a little different here. I tried turning on \"Sync Ownership\" and/or \"Sync Extended Attributes\", and found when the latter is turned on, regardless of the former, the issue shows up. It is the \"Sync Extended Attributes\" setting that goes wrong instead of \"Sync Ownership\".\n\nAlso, I can provide additional information if required. Thank you all for working on this issue and the amazing

Require either matching UID & GID OR matching Names.\r\n\r\nIf the 2 devices have a different Name => UID mapping, they can never be totaly equal. Therefore when syncing we try matching the Name and fall back to the UID. However when scanning for changes we currently require both the Name & UID to match. This leads to forever having out of sync files back and forth, or local additions when receive only.\r\n\r\nThis patch does not change the sending behavoir. It only change what we decide is equal for exisiting files with mismapped Name => UID,\r\n\r\nThe added testcases show the change: Test 1,5,6 are the same as current. Test 2,3 Are what change with this patch (from false to true). Test 4 is a subset of test 2 they is currently special cased as true, which does not chnage.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/10176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18172815940,"node_id":"CE_lADOAOCAEs6j42UyzwAAAAQ7LypE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/18172815940","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"0b0b2143ed30562ae3cb9b80c6619f0470f06de0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/0b0b2143ed30562ae3cb9b80c6619f0470f06de0","created_at":"2025-06-16T15:12:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18172868519,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs6j42UyzwAAAAQ7L_en","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/18172868519","actor":{"login":"saschazepter","id":60738409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzM4NDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60738409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschazepter","html_url":"https://github.com/saschazepter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschazepter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschazepter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschazepter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschazepter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschazepter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschazepter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschazepter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschazepter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saschazepter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0b0b2143ed30562ae3cb9b80c6619f0470f06de0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saschazepter/syncthing/commits/0b0b2143ed30562ae3cb9b80c6619f0470f06de0","created_at":"2025-06-16T15:15:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18241425971,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs6j42UyzwAAAAQ_RhIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/18241425971","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"259e9ef08e045a5df5bbec222e0592ec180a0323","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/259e9ef08e045a5df5bbec222e0592ec180a0323","created_at":"2025-06-20T07:55:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18373778886,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAOCAEs6j42UyzwAAAARHKZ3G","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/18373778886","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":
