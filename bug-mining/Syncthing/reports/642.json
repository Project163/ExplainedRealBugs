The only way to stop them sending notifications is to go to each device's UI and un-select A from the list of devices sharing the folder.\r\n\r\nI believe this behaviour is troublesome and counter-intuitive: to stop one device from sharing that folder, I also need to tweak all the other devices. A non-expert user could get very confused and not know how to fix the issue at all. What I would expect is for device A to tell the others: \"I had that folder, I don't want it anymore, stop sharing it with me\".\r\nTechnically, I'd say that upon deletion, A should remember the devices that were sharing the folder at that time, and try to notify each of them of the deletion. When a device is actually notified, A can forget about him having the folder. When all the devices are notified, A can finally forget about the folder altogether.\r\n\r\nI experienced this with device A being an android smartphone, with syncthing-android v0.9.6 (latest on f-droid) and syncthing v0.14.22-rc.1+12-g5a1ee7c. Other devices are laptops and ARM devices with auto-update enabled (currently using syncthing v0.14.23).\r\n\r\nI did some searching before posting, but I didn't find any reference of what should happen in this case, either confirming or disproving my experience.
