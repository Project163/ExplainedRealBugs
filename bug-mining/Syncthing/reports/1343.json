However, when deleting the folder on one client, the other goes \"Out of Sync\" in the GUI with \"access denied\" in the Syncthing console.\r\n\r\nThe folder must then be manually deleted on the second machine (using explorer or \"attrib\" and \"del\" commands in the console.)\r\n\r\nThis seems similar to Issue #1610 only with folders rather than files.\r\n\r\nNote: Windows sets the read-only attribute on folders automatically when you set a custom icon for said folder--that's how I initially discovered the issue. However, manually creating a read-only folder results in exactly the same behavior from Syncthing.\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v0.14.11\r\nOS Version: Windows 7","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3744/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
