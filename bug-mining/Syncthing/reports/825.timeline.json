there are multiple points that unix sockets improve over loopback interface.\n- security is handled at the OS level. Socket is a simple file with regular file permissions. TLS handshake and application-level authentication can be removed completely, which is a huge performance improvement on tools that do lots of requests on short-lived connections (say, `syncthing-inotify` for instance).\n- setup and administration are much simpler. The socket can just be put in syncthing's directory next to its other files, this will make it available to all processes of the user and nobody else. No api key to pass around, no ssl certificates to mess with, no port conflict.\n- no firewall rules to setup as unix socket is not exposed on the network. \n- much simpler codepaths (no encryption, no authentication) means less attack surface.\n- As a side benefit, performance is better as data does not go through the tcp/ip stack and overall data flow involves less context switches. Numbers vary but figures of ~30% more throughput [come up](http://zaiste.net/2015/05/postgresql_unix_socket_vs_tcpip_loopback/) regularly.\n\nThe main drawback is browsers cannot access it. That's why it's not good as a default on end-user's machines.\nOn the other hand, it's irrelevant when syncthing is deployed on a server. Even if the gui was to be made accessible, the typical production path in this case would be to go 3-tier, with a webserver such as nginx or apache working as a frontend to syncthing gui. Those [can use unix sockets](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_pass) to communicate with backends.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/249076494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"spectras","id":5879675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4Nzk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5879675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras","html_url":"https://github.com/spectras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/249078358","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3616#issuecomment-249078358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3616","id":249078358,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTA3ODM1OA==","user":{"login":"spectras","id":5879675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4Nzk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5879675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras","html_url":"https://github.com/spectras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-23T01:39:11Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T01:47:05Z","body":"Example of problematic scenario on multi-user environment with loopback. Let's say I have two users.\n- Let's say User A is assigned TCP port 10001 for his gui and User B is assigned TCP port 10002 for his gui.\n- Now, User A simply waits for User B to turn his syncthing off. For instance when he logs off or at next reboot.\n- User A starts his own customized copy of syncthing on User B's port, 10002.\n- User A waits for User B to be back.\n- User B fires his browser and opens his GUI bookmark (either he forgot to start his own syncthing or does not notice his own syncthing fails to load due to busy port).\n- User A collects User B's credentials with his customized copy of syncthing.\n\nSyncthing is vulnerable to this attack right now, as API key is plain text and authentication uses the Basic scheme. And the GUI's TLS certificate cannot be authenticated by the browser as it is self-signed.\nSure, it can be worked around by manually installing syncthing GUI's certificates into every users' browsers on every one of their devices, but configuration just became a nightmare. And users might still click the “open page anyway” button when the warning shows up in the browser.\n\nIt gets even worse when using `syncthing-inotify` as it will happily transmit the credentials without checking the server's certificate, and no error or notice will be generated for the user to know something fishy is going on.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/249078358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"spectras","id":5879675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4Nzk2NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5879675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras","html_url":"https://github.com/spectras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/249140612","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3616#issuecomment-249140612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3616","id":249140612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTE0MDYxMg==","user":{"login":"xduugu","id":1039174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzkxNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1039174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu","html_url":"https://github.com/xduugu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xduugu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-23T09:04:26Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T09:04:26Z","body":"I have the addition of unix sockets also on my list.

Purpose\r\n\r\nThe purpose of these patches is to allow the Web GUI to listen on an UNIX socket. This is useful when the Web GUI is proxified and the proxifier sits on the same host than the Syncthing instance. This way, one can avoid to waste a local TCP port for such purpose.\r\n\r\nAn UNIX socket can now be requested by specifying in the `<gui><address>` field an absolute pathname prefixed with `unix://`.\r\nExample: `<gui><address> unix:///tmp/syncthing-webui.sock </address></gui>`.\r\n\r\nNote that implementing such support required an additional patch to fix the way the core process is signaled to exit by the monitor process (patch on the same branch). This is necessary as my patch hooks in the GUI closing callback to remove the UNIX pathname.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI have performed a simple test by specifying an arbitrary UNIX socket pathname in the configuration file.\r\nWhen Syncthing starts, I correctly notice the creation of the UNIX socket (and in the same time that no more TCP socket are opened for the GUI);\r\nUsing `socat(1)` to relay this UNIX socket to a local TCP socket, I have tested that my Web browser accesses the Syncthing UI in the same way than with a classical TCP Socket; also, this socket is well interpreted as a localhost-one so no warning popup related to authentication is raised;\r\nWhen Syncthing exits (both with and without monitor mode), I correctly notice that the UNIX socket pathname is removed.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe documentation should be updated to reflect this new support. I currently did not provide any patch at this level. I will be enthusiast to provide one as soon as my current patches will be accepted.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3983/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/3983/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1468425821,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MTQ2ODQyNTgyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/1468425821","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-11T13:27:10Z","milestone":{"title":"Unplanned

Purpose\r\n\r\nThe documentation currently mentions /var/run/st.sock as a suggested location\r\nfor the socket file which has a couple of problems:\r\n\r\n - /var/run has been deprecated in favour of /run for a long time (both still\r\n   work as most distributions set up a symlink)\r\n - when running as a system instance as a given user, the user will most likely\r\n   not have permissions to write directly to /run\r\n\r\nSo we change the suggested socket path to /run/syncthing/st.sock and have the\r\nsystemd units take care of creating the directory. Further to #3616.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is possible to tell systemd to enable a unit for all users in one go which\r\nwill configure *user* services for every user:\r\nsystemctl --global enable syncthing.service\r\n\r\nThe problem with that is that root or other system users will then also try to\r\nspawn a syncthing instance on login which is probably not what you want.\r\n\r\nInstead only enable the *user* service for normal users.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI have been using the 2nd commit for months. The first commit doesn't change any existing behaviour and thus cannot break anything.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nMan page is updated accordingly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5314/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2652496298,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI2NTI0OTYyOTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2652496298","actor":{"login":"st-review","id":16196517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTk2NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16196517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review","html_url":"https://github.com/st-review","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-review/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-22T07:02:32Z","label":{"name":"frozen-due-to-age","color":"eeeeee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2652496301,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MjY1MjQ5NjMwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/2652496301","actor":{"login":"syncthing","id":7628018,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc2MjgwMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7628018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syncthing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-22T07:02:32Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
