Indeed we do not abort synchronization when the free disk space requirement is violated by any one of the files to be synced. And in my opinion this is a good behaviour, as it means that as many files as possible are synced within the limits set by the user (imagine one huge file and many tiny ones). Maybe there is a case to be made for aborting synchronization if pull order is not random, but I am not entirely convinced this would be beneficial for a wider audience. As Audrius said, please take that discussion to the forum and we can revisit once a consensus has been reached.\r\n\r\n2. I think that can happen if two consecutive files are pulled, where each individually do not violate the free disk space, but both together do. then if the first passes the check, and there's a race between doing the check for the second file and allocating the first file on disk.

The reason I submitted this issue is that I think partial synchronizations is one of the two cases where this parameter is useful (the other one being slow connections).\r\n\r\n2. I had 4 partial files last time I tried. I looked for some *advanced* parameter controlling how many files are synced in parallel, as setting this to 1 would be a potential workaround (obviously there are better solutions), but there doesn't seem to be any.\r\n\r\nI'll ask in the forum what people expect when they use the pull order parameter and I'll provide exact steps to reproduce this issue within the next 3 weeks. If you release the fix for #5949 by then I'll try to take it into account to make them more relevant. But in short, I think it's enough to set the free disk space parameter to `10%`, have files `a`, `b`, `c`, etc. with decreasing sizes and totaling something like 20% of the free disk space and being less than 10% individually, and set the pull order to `alphabetic`. I assume that the sizes also have to be different enough so that when a batch of files is synchronized, some of them are downloaded noticeably faster than others. Given that it's more or less a concurrency issue, I also don't expect it to necessarily happen all the time, although I've had it every time in my case.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/520812560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hiqua","id":3812042,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTIwNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3812042?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiqua","html_url":"https://github.com/hiqua","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiqua/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiqua/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiqua/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiqua/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiqua/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiqua/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiqua/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiqua/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hiqua/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/521149437","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5948#issuecomment-521149437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/5948","id":521149437,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMTE0OTQzNw==","user":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-14T08:17:17Z","updated_at":"2019-08-14T08:17:17Z","body":"I disagree that we should terminate sync if the next file in the pull order does not fit on disk.
