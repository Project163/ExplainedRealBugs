like this is about the `go` directive in go.mod. From https://go.dev/doc/modules/gomod-ref#go:\r\n\r\n> For packages within the module, the compiler rejects use of language features introduced after the version specified by the go directive. For example, if a module has the directive go 1.12, its packages may not use numeric literals like 1_000_000, which were introduced in Go 1.13.\r\n\r\nHowever inconsistently this only applies to packages in the module itself, not dependencies, in \"normal (modules) compilation\". Now if we vendor dependencies, these are apparently treated like packages of the module itself. The package in question is gated behind a `go1.18` build flag, so there's no actual problem with compatibility.\r\n\r\nI haven't been able to find any specifics on this behaviour or existing reports of similar issues in a quick search.
