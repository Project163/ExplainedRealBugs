usable.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/782567080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tomasz1986","id":5626656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MjY2NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5626656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986","html_url":"https://github.com/tomasz1986","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomasz1986/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4355346830,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQzNTUzNDY4MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4355346830","actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bf36f61d45c9381b6a7a6b43ebfeff02d4f3224a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imsodin/syncthing/commits/bf36f61d45c9381b6a7a6b43ebfeff02d4f3224a","created_at":"2021-02-20T14:19:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"imsodin","id":15955093,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTU1MDkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15955093?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin","html_url":"https://github.com/imsodin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imsodin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-20T14:27:20Z","updated_at":"2021-02-20T14:27:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7389","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7389/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7389/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7389/events","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/pull/7389","id":812629801,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTc2OTUwNjEx","number":7389,"title":"lib/fs:

#7385 by only checking for infinite recursion if the junctions-as-dirs option is enabled.\r\n\r\nPassing around options like I did in #7381 is tedious/repetitive. I thus changed the way options work from passing function `With...` style arguments to const/bitmask options. This allows knowing what options are active on any given filesystem, thus we don't need to pass options to the case- and walk-fs (and the case-fs can directly use option value for the key instead of constructing some arbitrary string).\r\n\r\nOne choice I am unsure about: I kept the variable length `opts ...FilesystemOptions` argument, even though multiple options can be passed by bitwise-or-ing options. I left that such that all `NewFilesystem` calls without options don't need to be changed to have an additional `, 0` (or something like `0, fs.OptionNone`) argument.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7389/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4445222096,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDQ0NTIyMjA5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4445222096","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-11T14:23:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4445222330,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ0NDUyMjIzMzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4445222330","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3938b61c3f0dc4facbb11e4826a3f54cd0dffe24","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/commits/3938b61c3f0dc4facbb11e4826a3f54cd0dffe24","created_at":"2021-03-11T14:23:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4468727889,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQ0Njg3Mjc4ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/4468727889","actor":{"login":"st-release","id":14043830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDQzODMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14043830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release","html_url":"https://github.com/st-release","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/st-release/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-17T08:19:05Z","milestone":{"title":"v1.15.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7169272762,"node_id":"LE_lADOAOCAEs4waWobzwAAAAGrUmu6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/events/7169272762","actor":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url"
