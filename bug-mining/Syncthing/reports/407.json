Total about 4000 files at 5...6GB disk.\n\nOn my VPS (which is one of the few with all 4 folder shares) I regularly see a slow memory leak when doing synchronization among clients and when doing scans. SyncThing starts at 40MB memory usage and soon finds itself in the 120MB range.  The VPS it's living on only has 256MB of RAM and I have other services (namely, httpd) competing for time/memory there. \n\nTop shows SyncThing at 20ish percent of my memory load\n\n```\n  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND\n20492 indrora   20   0   60732  55796   8884 S  0.0 21.3   0:05.73 syncthing\n```\n\nThis just goes up as SyncThing scans folders or synchronizes with devices. I use SyncThing on my phone to back up photos, and a few large photos can churn SyncThing into eating several tens-of-megs of RAM.\n","closed_by":{"login":"AudriusButkevicius","id":1144861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDQ4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1144861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius","html_url":"https://github.com/AudriusButkevicius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AudriusButkevicius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2589/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
