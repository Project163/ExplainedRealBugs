No\r\n\r\n### Include required information\r\n\r\nEnvironment: syncthing 1.17.0 installed from [Arch Linux official package](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/syncthing/)\r\n\r\nAny steps to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n* Create a DNS server that gives both an IPv4 address (e.g., `192.168.xxx.yyy`) and an IPv6 address (e.g., `fd0a:b:c:d::xxx:yyy`) for the internal domain name `server.internal`.\r\n* Use the domain name as the peer address (e.g., `quic6://server.internal:22000`) in Syncthing\r\n\r\nWhat happened:\r\n\r\nSyncthing attempts IPv4-compatible addresses (e.g., `[::ffff:192.168.xxx.yyy]:22000`) for the peer as per `strace`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsendto(13, <some long data>, 1252, 0, {sa_family=AF_INET6, sin6_port=htons(22000), sin6_flowinfo=htonl(0), inet_pton(AF_INET6, \"::ffff:192.168.xxx.yyy\", &sin6_addr), sin6_scope_id=0}, 28\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat you expected to happen instead:\r\n\r\nSyncthing connect to the normal IPv6 address (e.g., `[fd0a:b:c:d::xxx:yyy]:22000`)\r\n\r\nPossible fix:\r\n\r\nI noticed that in `quic_dial.go`, the network \"udp\" is used for resolving addresses [1]. On the other hand, in `quic_listen.go`, the proper network is used based on the URI scheme [2]. If I patch syncthing use the same approach in `quic_dial.go`, everything works fine.\r\n\r\n```Diff\r\ndiff --git a/lib/connections/quic_dial.go b/lib/connections/quic_dial.go\r\nindex 83c6246f5..a952d1ecd 100644\r\n--- a/lib/connections/quic_dial.go\r\n+++ b/lib/connections/quic_dial.go\r\n@@ -13,6 +13,7 @@ import (\r\n \t\"crypto/tls\"\r\n \t\"net\"\r\n \t\"net/url\"\r\n+\t\"strings\"\r\n \t\"time\"\r\n \r\n \t\"github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go\"\r\n@@ -45,7 +46,9 @@ type quicDialer struct {\r\n func (d *quicDialer) Dial(ctx context.Context, _ protocol.DeviceID, uri *url.URL) (internalConn, error) {\r\n \turi = fixupPort(uri, config.DefaultQUICPort)\r\n \r\n-\taddr, err := net.ResolveUDPAddr(\"udp\", uri.Host)\r\n+\tnetwork := strings.ReplaceAll(uri.Scheme, \"quic\", \"udp\")\r\n+\r\n+\taddr, err := net.ResolveUDPAddr(network, uri.Host)\r\n \tif err != nil {\r\n \t\treturn internalConn{}, err\r\n \t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/1921533c4cae1873d3cd63a28a590075ac7a48fc/lib/connections/quic_dial.go#L48\r\n[2] https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/1921533c4cae1873d3cd63a28a590075ac7a48fc/lib/connections/quic_listen.go#L84-L86","closed_by":{"login":"acolomb","id":6996887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTY4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6996887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb","html_url":"https://github.com/acolomb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/7809/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
