default configuration does not have GUI authentication set up.  As noted [on the forum](https://forum.syncthing.net/t/the-danger-zone-free-files-compliments-of-this-ignoramus/17378/7) and in https://github.com/SynoCommunity/spksrc/issues/4875, it would be advisable to set a user / password combination before first starting Syncthing.  Especially on headless systems (like NAS) which need to have a liberal GUI listen address and therefore just installing and starting Syncthing would open a big security hole without authentication.\r\n\r\nPresetting the credentials is possible in principle through a barebones `config.xml`, but in practice turning a password into a bcrypt hash is not always easy.  Neither should any external tooling depend on Syncthing's internal config XML structure.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion is to add a new `syncthing cli` command, or a separate binary altogether, which accepts a user name and password from the command line or standard input.  It then patches that into a specified `config.xml` file, re-using the internal configuration handling code.  Ideally it should also indicate through its exit code whether the config file is valid and normalize it when writing.\r\n\r\nThe existing method through the REST API cannot be used for this, as it needs to happen before the background service is started.  At least with the SPK packages for a Synology NAS, possibly also in other deployment scenarios.","closed_by":{"login":"acolomb","id":6996887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTY4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6996887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb","html_url":"https://github.com/acolomb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acolomb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/8021/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
