One of my nodes it added duplicate nodes. It probably doesn't matter functionally but it looks weird and messes with node lists\n\nAyano and NBSIGB is the same node. Note: I can't edit the one named NBSIG. But if i delete ayano both disappear. \n\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/153440/4425391/6a88c7de-45a9-11e4-93f0-7491967fe449.PNG)\n\nPart of the config, Here you can se that it added NBSIGBU even though it was already configured. \n\n``` xml\n<node id=\"NBSIGBU-....\" name=\"ayano\" compression=\"true\" introducer=\"true\">   \n   <address>dynamic</address>                                                                                                  \n</node>                                                                                                                         \n<node id=\"SHYPNFF-....\" name=\"freenas2\" compression=\"false\" introducer=\"false\n\">                                                                                                                                  \n   <address>dynamic</address>                                                                                                  \n</node>                                                                                                                         \n<node id=\"7DCLG2A-....\" name=\"origo\" compression=\"false\" introducer=\"true\">  \n   <address>dynamic</address>                                                                                                  \n</node>                                                                                                                         \n<node id=\"NBSIGBU-...\" compression=\"false\" introducer=\"false\"></node>                                            \n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/745/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
