It's still possible that a user was crafty or unlucky to create a dir that has the right length, but I don't think that's anything we need to be concerned about (that dir will just be ignored or deleted if empty). Fixed in #7184 \r\n\r\nAs to whether it would be good enough (because easier) or even better to just ignore everything that's in a toplevel `.synthing-enc` type directory:  \r\nI think it's not better. Sure all those auto-generated files are just an annoyance. However those are an annoyance in both receive-encrypted and \"normal\" folders. So an actual solution should take care of them in general - something like adding common (effecting all folders locally) and/or default ignore patterns.  \r\nAssuming the above judgement holds, that leaves us with the evaluation of \"good enough\" (ignore everything) vs \"complexity\" (best effort filtering of extraneous items). This bug is evidence that it can go wrong, thus I clearly can't claim it's super simple, then again I am somewhat hopeful with the pending fix we are clear now. And I haven't come up with any scenario where a mess happens, such that it's hard for the user to make a distinction between Syncthing's items and extraneous files. So we might as well not care about the distinction and call it good enough.  \r\nI am sort of undecided, with a tendency to keep filtering potentially extraneous files, but my gut says that I just want to keep it because it's already implemented and it would be better to remove it :D
