I don't think low delays like this are ever a good idea (at least it's not the minimum 10ms o.O), that's besides the point if there's a bug that keeps the loop spinning - that's not nice at any delay, just less noticeable at higher ones. Would be great if you could provide debug logs when this occurs again, so we can see what's actually going on and hopefully diagnose the issue that way.  \nWarning: This will cause a lot of logging, you likely only want to enable it for a short time. Also it will contain file paths, if that's an issue to share (publically or privately) let me know and we'll figure something out.  \nFirst you need to make sure your logs are persistend somewhere, the UI wont work here. This depends on how you run it, on linux typically via systemd (logs in journal). Otherwise you can use `syncthing --paths` to see if it logs to a file and where.  \nThen enable `watchaggregator` debug logging, either through the web UI (actions > logs) or by setting the env var `STTRACE=watchaggregator`). While ideally this would be in place when the issue starts, it might not be necessary. And unless you can reproduce the issue at will, it's likely impractical to have it enabled before - what I mean to say is, that if you only enable it after the issue starts, that's still good enough.
