is a bit of a moon shot, and I haven't yet figured out how to fully polish this.\r\n\r\nEssentially when launching via explorer, it starts a tray icon, in all other cases it starts headless.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1144861/41206661-57e5f7ec-6cff-11e8-9969-907a2ec80561.png)\r\n\r\nAlso, it's compiled headless by default, this avoids the console popping up when launched from explorer.\r\nThis does not break stdin/out wiring, and I can still see log output if I launch from cygwin.\r\n\r\nHowever if I launch from cmd, it seems to start a headless process, so I have no console attached it seems.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we should revert the compiled headless, and accept the console popping up briefly before we wire the tray icon.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the tray icon fails, we can keep the console visible,\r\n\r\nCC
