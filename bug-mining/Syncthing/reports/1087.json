When closed by the remote end, a GUI error bar appears because of an undefined object entry.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce ###\r\n\r\nUnless noted otherwise, carry out on device A's GUI:\r\n\r\n1. Add remote device B (which must be offering us a connection / listed as pending device).\r\n2. Wait until it shows Connected (Unused) on A.\r\n3. Observe that it is included in `GET /rest/system/connections`.\r\n4. Wait for a pending folder notification from the remote device, but do not accept. [possibly not required / unrelated?]\r\n5. Remove the remote device B through the GUI on A.\r\n6. Observe that it is no longer included in `GET /rest/system/connections`.\r\n7. Observe that the remote device (B) itself still lists our local device (A) as \"Up to Date\".  The connection is not really closed, there was no corresponding log message on A either.\r\n8. Pause device A in B's GUI, leading to the connection being finally closed.\r\n9. Observe the following GUI error message on A:\r\n\r\n\t\tError: $scope.connections[arg.data.id] is undefined\r\n\t\t@http://127.0.0.1:8385/syncthing/core/syncthingController.js:221:13\r\n\t\t$broadcast@http://127.0.0.1:8385/vendor/angular/angular.js:14908:28\r\n\t\tsuccessFn/<@http://127.0.0.1:8385/syncthing/core/eventService.js:27:32\r\n\t\tsuccessFn@http://127.0.0.1:8385/syncthing/core/eventService.js:23:22\r\n\t\t$http/promise.success/<@http://127.0.0.1:8385/vendor/angular/angular.js:9452:13\r\n\t\tprocessQueue@http://127.0.0.1:8385/vendor/angular/angular.js:13337:27\r\n\t\tscheduleProcessQueue/<@http://127.0.0.1:8385/vendor/angular/angular.js:13353:39\r\n\t\t$eval@http://127.0.0.1:8385/vendor/angular/angular.js:14589:28\r\n\t\t$digest@http://127.0.0.1:8385/vendor/angular/angular.js:14405:31\r\n\t\t$apply@http://127.0.0.1:8385/vendor/angular/angular.js:14694:24\r\n\t\tscheduleApplyAsync/applyAsyncId<@http://127.0.0.1:8385/vendor/angular/angular.js:14984:22\r\n\t\tcompleteOutstandingRequest@http://127.0.0.1:8385/vendor/angular/angular.js:4959:10\r\n\t\tBrowser/self.defer/timeoutId<@http://127.0.0.1:8385/vendor/angular/angular.js:5347:33\r\n\t\tlogbar.js:11:22\r\n\t\t\tmethod http://127.0.0.1:8385/syncthing/development/logbar.js:11\r\n\t\t\tAngular 3\r\n\t\t\tsuccessFn http://127.0.0.1:8385/syncthing/core/eventService.js:27\r\n\t\t\tsuccessFn http://127.0.0.1:8385/syncthing/core/eventService.js:23\r\n\t\t\tAngular 9\r\n\r\nApparently the GUI tries to parse the DEVICE_DISCONNECTED event for a\r\nconnection which was already removed from the model.  ​\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\nSyncthing Version: v1.5.0-rc.1 (6bbd24de122fbe3e58385d6f91f7ba8d7f2f0800) on device A, v1.4.2 on device B\r\nOS Version: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (both instances running on the same host if that matters)\r\nBrowser Version: Firefox 75.0 (64-bit)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"calmh","id":125426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh","html_url":"https://github.com/calmh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/calmh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/6564/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
