But if I clean up the folder on my phone I dont want that the fotos are also deleted on my pc. Also if I delete e.g. some unneeded thumbnail-folders on my pc I dont want my pc to delete them on the mobile phone.\n\nThe option \"Folder Master\" is already given, so I can easily delete the thumbnail folder but if I at the moment clean up the camera-folder on my mobile phone, the files get also deleted on my pc which is what I dont want. So to do this, for me its as easy as do not push the delete to the pc. The phone is simply doing as it have never had the file. For the phone it is the same as if I delete a file on the pc and then copy it back on the pc (but because of the \"Folder Master\"-option it is not synced back to the phone).\n\nAnd for the file that is updated on the phone: I dont know, how is it handled at the moment? This does not depend on the new feature, or? So this situation is also possible with the \"Folder Master\" option enabled...!?\n\nAh and btw sorry for the duplicate..

It's \"easy\" to just sync one way. It's more difficult to not sync both ways. :) The way sync works currently is that each file has a version number that increases. For example version=5 can contain some data, version=6 can be the deleted version. If a machine has version 5, it knows it should go up to version 6 and delete the file. But if we ignore the delete, and then create a new file in the same place - is that a new file, newer than the delete we ignored? If we ignore version 6 (the delete) and keep version 5, but there is then a version 7 with other content, should we sync to that? What if we manually deleted the file after ignoring the delete...?\n\nPoint being, it's tricky. :) At this point, too tricky for this special case I think. If you or someone else wants to iron out all the details though, I won't be against it.\n\n(I don't think is an exact duplicate of #62 though, that's something slightly

think too complicate, if the feature is implemented as I mean, the behaviour is exactly the same as if I am doing the following:\n- Set camera-folder on the phone to \"Folder Master\"\n- Let camera sync files to the pc\n- Set pc to versioning (keep 1 last file)\n- Delete pictures from the phone\n- Copy pictures from version folder back to the main-folder on the pc (remember they get not synced back to the phone because on the phone \"Folder Master\" is active)\n\nIn this scenario we do have the same \"tricky\" problems, but for Camera-Upload of the phone to the pc it would be a very nice feature and you never will have any problems with updated files as usually the phone takes a picture with date-string in its name which is never modified..\n\nI know the lamport clock thing with numbers for file-versions but I do not see the problem, following  my previous example:\n- New picture X on phone detected (gets version 1)\n- Picture X is uploaded to pc (pc now also have version 1 of the file)\n- Picture X is deleted on phone (with activated \"Do not push file delete\", so it gets no new version-number it is simply forgotton by the phone)\n- Phone does as it has never had the file\n- Pc says I have version 1 of picture X\n- Phone says I am \"Folder Master\" I dont want to have Picture X version 1 because I did not initially created it\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/comments/69960380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sphinx02","id":10533724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTMzNzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10533724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sphinx02","html_url":"https://github.com/sphinx02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sphinx02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sphinx02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sphinx02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sphinx02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sphinx02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sphinx02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sphinx02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sphinx02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sphinx02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"bigbear2nd","id":7719800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7719800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigbear2nd","html_url":"https://github.com/bigbear2nd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigbear2nd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigbear2nd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigbear2nd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigbear2nd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigbear2nd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigbear2nd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigbear2nd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigbear2nd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bigbear2nd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-21T15:10:19Z","updated_at":"2015-07-21T15:10:19Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/syncthing/syncthing/issues/2076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/pull/2076","id":96290251,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDA0NDYyOTI=","number":2076,"title":"Optionally
