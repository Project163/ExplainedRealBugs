#4100.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nChanges [index.html](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/gui/default/index.html) so that the `<td>` element is consistent with per-folder's HTML. Adds a tooltip, similar to folder. \r\n\r\nAdds `directories` attribute to the `localStateTotal` in [syncthingController.js](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/master/gui/default/syncthing/syncthingController.js) which populates the template engine's variables. This value is obtained from `$scope.model[f].localDirectories`, which has the correct value. This is the same method as used for other attributes, thus requiring no further changes.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nPreliminary test of generated web UI:\r\n![syncthing issue
