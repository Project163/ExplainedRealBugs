 Versioning
 ----------
 
-This project uses a custom versioning scheme as described below.
+Version 35.0.0+
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
-Given a version ``cryptography X.Y.Z``,
+Beginning with release 35.0.0 ``cryptography`` uses a Firefox-inspired version
+scheme.
 
-* ``X.Y`` is a decimal number that is incremented for
-  potentially-backwards-incompatible releases.
+Given a version ``cryptography X.Y.Z``,
 
-  * This increases like a standard decimal.
-    In other words, 0.9 is the ninth release, and 1.0 is the tenth (not 0.10).
-    The dividing decimal point can effectively be ignored.
+* ``X`` indicates the major version number. This is incremented on any feature
+  release.
+* ``Y`` is always ``0``.
+* ``Z`` is an integer that is incremented for minor backward-compatible
+  releases (such as fixing security issues or correcting regressions in a major
+  release).
 
-* ``Z`` is an integer that is incremented for backward-compatible releases.
+This scheme is compatible with `SemVer`_, though many major releases will
+**not** include any backwards-incompatible changes.

 From time to time we will want to change the behavior of an API or remove it

 From time to time, we may decide to deprecate an API that is particularly
 widely used. In these cases, we may decide to provide an extended deprecation
 period, at our discretion.
