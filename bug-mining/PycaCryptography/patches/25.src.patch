 Known security limitations
 --------------------------
 
-Lack of secure memory wiping
-============================
+Secure memory wiping
+====================
 
 `Memory wiping`_ is used to protect secret data or key material from attackers
-with access to uninitialized memory. This can be either because the attacker
-has some kind of local user access or because of how other software uses
-uninitialized memory.
+with access to deallocated memory. This is a defense-in-depth measure against
+vulnerabilities that leak application memory.
 
-Python exposes no API for us to implement this reliably and as such almost all
-software in Python is potentially vulnerable to this attack. The
+Many ``cryptography`` APIs which accept ``bytes`` also accept types which
+implement the buffer interface. Thus, users wishing to do so can pass
+``memoryview`` or another mutable type to ``cryptography`` APIs, and overwrite
+the contents once the data is no longer needed.
+
+However, ``cryptography`` does not clear memory by default, as there is no way
+to clear immutable structures such as ``bytes``. As a result, ``cryptography``,
+like almost all software in Python is potentially vulnerable to this attack. The
 `CERT secure coding guidelines`_ assesses this issue as "Severity: medium,
 Likelihood: unlikely, Remediation Cost: expensive to repair" and we do not
 consider this a high risk for most users.
