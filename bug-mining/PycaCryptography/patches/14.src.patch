 Doing a release of ``cryptography`` requires a few steps.
 
+Security Releases
+-----------------
+
+In addition to the other steps described below, for a release which fixes a
+security vulnerability, you should also include the following steps:
+
+* Request a `CVE from MITRE`_. Once you have received the CVE, it should be
+  included in the :doc:`changelog`. Ideally you should request the CVE before
+  starting the release process so that the CVE is available at the time of the
+  release.
+* Ensure that the :doc:`changelog` entry credits whoever reported the issue.
+* The release should be announced on the `oss-security`_ mailing list, in
+  addition to the regular announcement lists.
