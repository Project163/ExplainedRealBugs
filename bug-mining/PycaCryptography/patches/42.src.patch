+RSA PKCS1 v1.5 constant time decryption
+---------------------------------------
+
+RSA decryption has several different modes, one of which is PKCS1 v1.5. When
+used in online contexts, a secure protocol implementation requires that peers
+not be able to tell whether RSA PKCS1 v1.5 decryption failed or succeeded,
+even by timing variability.
+
+``cryptography`` does not provide an API that makes this possible, due to the
+fact that RSA decryption raises an exception on failure, which takes a
+different amount of time than returning a value in the success case.
+
+For this reason, at present, we recommend not implementing online protocols
+that use RSA PKCS1 v1.5 decryption with ``cryptography`` -- independent of this
+limitation, such protocols generally have poor security properties due to their
+lack of forward security.
+
+If a constant time RSA PKCS1 v1.5 decryption API is truly required, you should
+contribute one to ``cryptography``.
