+Importing cryptography causes a ``RuntimeError`` about OpenSSL 1.0.1
+--------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+The OpenSSL project has dropped support for the 1.0.1 release series. Since it
+is no longer receiving security patches from upstream, ``cryptography`` is also
+dropping support for it. To fix this issue you should upgrade to a newer
+version of OpenSSL (1.0.2 or later). This may require you to upgrade to a newer
+operating system.
+
+For the 2.9 release, you can set the ``CRYPTOGRAPHY_ALLOW_OPENSSL_101``
+environment variable. Please note that this is *temporary* and will be removed
+in ``cryptography`` 3.0.
