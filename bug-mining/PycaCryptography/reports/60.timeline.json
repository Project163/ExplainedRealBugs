off, thanks for the super helpful project! :cake:\r\n\r\nI was looking at exposing `pem::parse_many` to Python users via the `cryptography` package (https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6351#issuecomment-932148321). In that process I discovered that `parse_many` silently discards all invalid sections, which I found quite surprising. That makes it hard to provide good error messages as I cannot differentiate between malformed and missing sections.\r\n\r\nLong story short, would you entertain the idea of either changing `parse_many` to return a `Result<Vec<Pem>>` or adding an alternative method name (`parse_all`, `parse_many_strict`?) that returns an error on the first parsing failure? I'd be happy to send a PR with whatever you prefer. 😃 \r\n\r\nFor reference, here's the current `parse_many` implementation: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jcreekmore/pem-rs/blob/b2cfec184815fecace9b5b1844eb6b15bda69793/src/lib.rs#L320-L326","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcreekmore/pem-rs/issues/27/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcreekmore/pem-rs/issues/27/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/932284647","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6351#issuecomment-932284647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/6351","id":932284647,"node_id":"IC_kwDOALYunM43kYjn","user":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-01T14:34:01Z","updated_at":"2021-10-01T14:34:01Z","body":"I feel this is quite a common use case. @tiran's high level API sounds good, from a convenience perspective it would be super nice if `load_pem_x509_certificate` would just parse the entire PEM file and return a certificate object iff there is exactly one `CERTIFICATE` section. That saves everyone from reimplementing the same for loop iterating through `parse_pem` results.\r\n\r\n\r\nFWIW I took a brief look at implementing this using the `pem` crate in Rust, but that seems to need some upstream changes first (see linked issue above this message).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/932284647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5394851786,"node_id":"MEE_lADOALYunM48ZGHPzwAAAAFBjufK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/events/5394851786","actor":{"login":"tiran","id":444071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDA3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/444071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran","html_url":"https://github.com/tiran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-01T14:34:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5394851795,"node_id":"SE_lADOALYunM48ZGHPzwAAAAFBjufT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/events/5394851795","actor":{"login":"tiran","id":444071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDA3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/444071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran","html_url":"https://github.com/tiran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tiran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-10-01T14:34:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/932512616","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6351#issuecomment-932512616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/6351","id":932512616,"node_id":"IC_kwDOALYunM43lQNo","user":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-01T19:59:55Z","updated_at":"2021-10-01T19:59:55Z","body":"Looks

Do we have opinions on `parse_pem` returning a `(type: PemTypeEnum, data: bytes)` tuple vs returning a `(type: str, data: bytes)` tuple?
