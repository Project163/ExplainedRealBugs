packaging `cryptography` for OpenIndiana and I need to run tests to make sure the package is okay.  Since the `cryptography_vectors` is missing in the `test` extras some additional care is needed to make sure it is installed into the test environment.  This is not a big deal because it is scriptable, but it would be great if the `cryptography` testing works out of the box and we can do the `cryptography` packaging fully automatic, simple and straightforward.\r\n\r\nThank you.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/1913393293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mtelka","id":3000173,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDAxNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3000173?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtelka","html_url":"https://github.com/mtelka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtelka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtelka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtelka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtelka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtelka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtelka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtelka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtelka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtelka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/1913394061","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/10242#issuecomment-1913394061","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10242","id":1913394061,"node_id":"IC_kwDOALYunM5yDBON","user":{"login":"alex","id":772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex","html_url":"https://github.com/alex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-28T01:02:20Z","updated_at":"2024-01-28T01:02:20Z","body":"Ok, so if we were going to do this, I guess the move would be:\r\n\r\n- In general on `main`, there's no bound on `cryptography_vectors` -- if you use code from main it's your responsibility to ensure the right version of the vectors is installed.\r\n- When we do a version bump for a release we add an `=={version}` bound to the dependency. This works in CI because the local vectors has the right version, and works in release because it's the right version\r\n- When we re-open main after a release, we remove the bound\r\n\r\nDoes that
