Meaning try not to go via OpenSSL to gain RC2. Most of the time it should not be needed. And when that fails, fallback to a vendored in implementation of RC2 to on-the-fly convert to unencrypted or AES-256-CBC to then continue back via OpenSSL or anything else.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to how other pieces of software have adapted to continue using obsolete cryptography, as required to maintain interoperability with whatever you want to support. I.e. I have seen projects vendor in MD4, MD5, RC2, RC4 to continue supporting NTLM auth and similar things.\r\n\r\nCrashing upon importing your library, because legacy provider is not available, is not optimal for all the users who are on modern linux distributions, and are not planning on using weak cryptography (which obviously is impossible to know ahead of time). As the current variable is \"opt out of legacy algorithms support\", instead of \"opt into legacy algorithms support\", and thus forcing systems to carry additional runtime dependencies which depending on use case will never be used (with a declining probability over time).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/2296376567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xnox","id":19779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Nzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xnox","html_url":"https://github.com/xnox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xnox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xnox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xnox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xnox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xnox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xnox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xnox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xnox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xnox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/2296383367","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/11450#issuecomment-2296383367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/11450","id":2296383367,"node_id":"IC_kwDOALYunM6I4AeH","user":{"login":"stefanor","id":442117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjExNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/442117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanor","html_url":"https://github.com/stefanor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stefanor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-19T11:48:29Z","updated_at":"2024-08-19T11:48:29Z","body":"Vendoring
