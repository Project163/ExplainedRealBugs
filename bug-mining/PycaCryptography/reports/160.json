That would allow someone who is okay handling those negative serial numbers to opt-into supporting them; and those who want strict compliance with the RFCs to reject the certificates.\r\n\r\nThe reason that I bring this up is that there are still many real world examples of negative serial numbers being present in X509 certificates, despite deviation from RFCs. This is the unfortunate scenario where \"RFC / Specification says one thing\" and \"Real stuff seen in the wild on the internet\" differs enough to be non-ideal for parser authors. This is especially true when there have been multiple revisions of the standard :(\r\n\r\nThe example from  https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/6609 is just one item. There are people in the information security space who use cryptography for parsing and inspecting X509 certificates. Restricting the allowed space for ( otherwise usable ) X509 certificates can hamper security research and tracking of threat actors, since they cannot take advantage of new functionality offered by cryptography moving forward.","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
