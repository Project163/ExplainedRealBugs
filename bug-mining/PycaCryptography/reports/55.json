However, we lost type hinting with that. We should add type stubs for the methods we're adding.\r\n\r\nWe should also try to figure out how to enforce that we keep public methods in the module and type signatures in sync. This may not be feasible until we can add more mypy flags though.","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5975/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
