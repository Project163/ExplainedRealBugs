The existence of a UUID arc is (unwelcome) news to me. 😄 This error occurs because we internally parse arcs as u32. We can make them wider (64-bits is easy). Should we widen even if we choose not to support 128-bit arc values?\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards aligning with Go here in rejecting >64-bit, as the existence of a very large ecosystem that doesn't support this means it's likely to die

checked some more, and I'm afraid I am actually misremembering the golang limit and the RFC:\r\n\r\n[rfc3280 appendix-B](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3280#appendix-B) says (my emphasis):\r\n\r\n>   Object Identifiers (OIDs) are used throughout this specification to\r\n>   identify certificate policies, public key and signature algorithms,\r\n>   certificate extensions, etc.  There is no maximum size for OIDs.\r\n>   This specification mandates support for OIDs which have **arc elements**\r\n>   **with values that are less than 2^28**, that is, they MUST be between 0\r\n>   and 268,435,455, inclusive.  This allows each arc element to be\r\n>   represented within a single 32 bit word.  Implementations MUST also\r\n>   support OIDs where the length of the dotted decimal (see [RFC 2252],\r\n>   section 4.1) string representation can be up to 100 bytes\r\n>   (inclusive).  Implementations MUST be able to handle OIDs with up to\r\n>   20 elements (inclusive).  CAs SHOULD NOT issue certificates which\r\n>   contain OIDs that exceed these requirements.  Likewise, CRL issuers\r\n>   SHOULD NOT issue CRLs which contain OIDs that exceed these\r\n>   requirements.\r\n\r\nAnd golang is apparently limited to 28 bits as well: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19933 .\r\n\r\nSo I was wrong in mentioning 64 bits as the golang limit and better cutoff, and 28bits seems to be the widespread implementation limit.\r\n\r\nSo I leave to you the decision of how this \"regression\" (it is technically a regression, but only for users in a very homogeneous environment, others will have had issues long ago anyway) should be handled.\r\n\r\nEDIT: so many

128 bits OIDs in my CA implementation).
