seems to be in the cryptography code.\r\n\r\nI have tracked this down to `evp_pkey_export_to_provider` where, in 42.0.0 the key types are DHX and DH, whereas earlier they seem to be DH and DH.  I suspect the issue is in the transition of `load_pem_public_key` to rust in 42.0.0.\r\n\r\nAny insights appreciated.","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10790/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
