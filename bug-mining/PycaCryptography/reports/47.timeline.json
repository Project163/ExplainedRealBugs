clear \"build environment changes\" qualify. I think it's a pretty reasonable (though certainly not definitive) that they are not changes to an API in any sense, so you don't need to bump a major version. (Now, I have my doubts with respect to the idea of breaking changes from a documented API, in light of observations such as Hyrum's law. This is why the cryptography test suite actually runs the tests of our substantial downstreams!)\r\n\r\nBut, if they were, I think we'd actually need to bump our major version pretty regularly -- every time we drop a Python version or an OpenSSL version or a LibreSSL version. All of which happen somewhat regularly (because we support such a large and diverse set of platforms).\r\n\r\nNow, bumping major version regularly is perhaps \"fine\", version numbers are free after all (note to self: find a way to charge money for these). However, if say, 1/2 of all releases as are major version bumps, people are unlikely to accord them the same respect, leading to people being upset when a major version includes a change like this. Of course, they'd be unable to complain they weren't warned, but that's hardly useful. Alert fatigue, normalization of deviance, and other psychological factors are every bit as real as strict adherence to rules when we're considering complex systems failure modes.\r\n\r\nWith that said, another valid choice I'd propose is the version scheme adhered to by Firefox, Chrome, etc: major version bumps and patch bumps only:\r\n\r\n3.5 -> 35.0.0, if we issue a patch release it's 35.0.1, otherwise our next release is 36.0.0.\r\n\r\nIt's merits are that it's technically semver compatible, it's fairly predictable, and it communicates at least a little info on the relative age of the project.\r\n\r\nIts demerits are that it probably won't solve the real problem here, which was that folks were surprised a major change happened at all.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/776067787/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alex","id":772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex","html_url":"https://github.com/alex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/776087016","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5801#issuecomment-776087016","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5801","id":776087016,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NjA4NzAxNg==","user":{"login":"ggggggggg","id":5192577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTI1Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5192577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggggggggg","html_url":"https://github.com/ggggggggg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggggggggg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggggggggg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggggggggg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggggggggg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggggggggg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggggggggg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggggggggg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggggggggg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ggggggggg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-09T16:59:44Z","updated_at":"2021-02-09T16:59:44Z","body":"I had made a comment, but then realized I was sent to another issue from a reddit thread that was specifically linked to an archived version to prevent commenting.

proposed the creation of a PyCA Cryptography LTS release branch. The LTS branch would give users more time to adjust their infrastructure for Rust requirements. Alpine and musl libc maintainers might even get manymusl binary wheels ready in time. I support their proposal and would be interested to assist with and use a LTS release in RHEL 8 and CentOS.\r\n\r\nTo reduce maintenance overhead and to set user expectations, a long term support branch should be clearly scoped. Therefore I propose\r\n\r\n* LTS is based on 3.3.x branch (no Rust dependency)\r\n* only updates for security issues (implies that bug must get a CVE).\r\n* EOL on 2021-12-31. No further updates after EOL date\r\n* supports for currently supported OpenSSL API/ABI. That implies compatibility patches for upcoming OpenSSL 3.0.0 will not be backported.\r\n* feature updates are out of scope\r\n* source-only releases, so you don't have to release a new LTS when OpenSSL does a security update. Users can use binary wheels of latest update.\r\n\r\nThis proposal should keep the workload small and cover majority of users.\r\n\r\n10 months until EOL should be sufficient for majority of users to get Rust infrastructure in place. The next stable Debian 11 (Bullseye) should be released roughly half a year before the EOL date. Latest Alpine, CentOS 8, Fedora, and Ubuntu already have recent enough Rust.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5799/reactions","total_count":24,"+1":20,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/777192524","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5801#issuecomment-777192524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5801","id":777192524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NzE5MjUyNA==","user":{"login":"digitalresistor","id":649426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTQyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/649426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalresistor","html_url":"https://github.com/digitalresistor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalresistor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalresistor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalresistor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalresistor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalresistor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalresistor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalresistor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalresistor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/digitalresistor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-11T04:15:12Z","updated_at":"2021-02-11T04:15:12Z","body":"> People with whom I had the opportunity to speak about it were surprised because cryptography was a transitive dependency.

the Github \"uses\" feature to go over various repositories, looking at large companies that use the software, as well as knowing that I've broken peoples software in the past because of changes which bumped the version number (the projects I work on don't use SemVer) removing features that have been deprecated for several versions and thus were already returning warnings.\r\n\r\nSecond, version pinning in `setup.py` is generally not recommended, so when you go down into the dependency tree it is likely that you will find a pin that is `>=` and doesn't pin the upper version, so that the package can make sure that its dependency meets a certain requirement (or has a certain API) but doesn't limit any potential for a newer version.\r\n\r\nI've even been bit by this myself in various projects where a dependency of a dependency didn't correctly pin, and my top-level project didn't version
