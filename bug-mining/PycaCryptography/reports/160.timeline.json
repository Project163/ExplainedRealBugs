PYCA team!\r\n\r\nWhen investigating a difference in behavior with PyOpenSSL behavior, I came across potential issue with X509 certificate creation in cryptography. The current version of the cryptography package can be used to **create** X509 certificates with common name values as empty strings, and with strings that are >64 characters in length. This is a deviation from rfc5280 ( https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#appendix-A.1 ) where ``CommonName`` is defined as ``CommonName ::= PrintableString (SIZE (1..ub-common-name-length))`` and ``ub-common-name-length`` is`` ub-common-name-length INTEGER ::= 64``. The cryptography library allows setting common name values to zero length strings and strings > 64 characters in length.\r\n\r\nI am **not** concerned about the ability to **read** a certificate with a CN field that is not conforming with the length specifications, as its clearly possible for in-the-wild certificates to be created with these values. Similar to #10247 there is a good value in being able to read such certificates.\r\n\r\nPython version and library components:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python -V\r\nPython 3.11.4\r\n$ python -m pip list | grep -E \"cryptography|pip|cffi|setuptools\"\r\ncffi                          1.15.1\r\ncryptography                  42.0.5\r\npip                           23.2.1\r\nsetuptools                    68.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nCryptography was installed from pypi using the cryptography-42.0.5-cp39-abi3-manylinux_2_28_x86_64.whl\r\n\r\nExample code to make some CA certs with these invalid properties:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport os\r\nimport sys\r\nimport binascii\r\nimport datetime\r\n\r\nONE_YEAR_TD = datetime.timedelta(days=365)\r\n\r\nimport cryptography.x509 as c_x509\r\nimport cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes as c_hashes\r\nimport cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa as c_rsa\r\nimport cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization as c_serialization\r\n\r\ndef genCert(cname: str, prvkey: c_rsa.RSAPrivateKey) -> c_x509.Certificate:\r\n\r\n    pubkey = prvkey.public_key()\r\n    builder = c_x509.CertificateBuilder()\r\n    builder = builder.subject_name(c_x509.Name([\r\n        c_x509.NameAttribute(c_x509.NameOID.COMMON_NAME, cname),\r\n    ]))\r\n\r\n    now = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC)\r\n    builder = builder.not_valid_before(now)\r\n    builder = builder.not_valid_after(now + ONE_YEAR_TD)  # certificates are good for 1 years\r\n    builder = builder.serial_number(int(binascii.hexlify(os.urandom(16)).decode('utf8'), 16))\r\n    builder = builder.public_key(pubkey)\r\n\r\n    # Mark the cert as a CA -

negative certificate numbers\r\n\r\nContext: as discussed on IRC, when upgrading from a ~Jan 2024 state of OpenIndiana to Aug 2024, my local zones would not boot, behaving strange and effectively unable to run binaries. After some investigation I found that the zones' packages did not get updated, and `pkg` would calculate its upgrade path for 10 minutes and then crash with a stack trace ending in:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.9/vendor-packages/pkg/client/pkgplan.py\", line 346, in evaluate\r\n      dest_pub, self.image.trust_anchors,\r\n    File \"/usr/lib/python3.9/vendor-packages/pkg/client/image.py\", line 352, in trust_anchors\r\n      x509.load_pem_x509_certificate( cryptography.utils.CryptographyDeprecationWarning:\r\n         Parsed a negative serial number, which is disallowed by RFC 5280. Loading this\r\n         certificate will cause an exception in the next release of cryptography. \r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/10247 as of this writing (Aug 2024) the support is still there, just the deprecation warnings are sent. In `pkg(5)` this happens in a `try/except` context, so the warning crashes the program. Shrugging it off like in this PR let my zones complete their upgrade and happily

I'm opening this to root-cause a [handful](https://x509-limbo.com/anomalous-results/gocryptox509-go1.21.5/) of potentially anomalous path building results with `crypto/x509`, which we found with [x509-limbo](https://x509-limbo.com/).\r\n\r\nFirst, a disclaimer: I suspect that many of the results above are expected or are non-issues from crypto/x509's perspective, since many are \"pedantic\" checks against a strict reading of RFC 5280. For example, [`rfc5280::nc::not-allowed-in-ee-critical`](https://x509-limbo.com/testcases/rfc5280/#rfc5280ncnot-allowed-in-ee-critical) is technically disallowed under RFC 5280, but all other implementations appear to broadly ignore it.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some discrepancies for which crypto/x509 is the outlier. A sampling of anomalous positives (chains built where other implementations fail):\r\n\r\n* [`rfc5280::aki::critical-aki`](https://x509-limbo.com/testcases/rfc5280/#rfc5280akicritical-aki): all other implementations under test reject critical AKIs; crypto/x509 accepts it\r\n* [`rfc5280::nc::nc-permits-invalid-dns-san`](https://x509-limbo.com/testcases/rfc5280/#rfc5280ncnc-permits-invalid-dns-san): crypto/x509 and OpenSSL both accept a malformed DNS SAN that conflicts with a Name Constraint\r\n* [`rfc5280::ee-critical-aia-invalid`](https://x509-limbo.com/testcases/rfc5280/#rfc5280ee-critical-aia-invalid): all other implementations reject critical AIAs; crypto/x509 accepts them (despite not supporting AIA chasing)\r\n\r\nThere are also some anomalous negatives (chains that fail to build where success is expected), but crypto/x509 is largely in consensus with other implementations around them (the main outlier is OpenSSL).\r\n\n\n### What did you see happen?\n\nThe full rendering of potentially anomalous results is here: <https://x509-limbo.com/anomalous-results/gocryptox509-go1.21.5/>\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, some of these are almost certainly intended behavior on crypto/x509's part as part of handling real-world chains, especially outside of the Web PKI. However, I could find a document or docstring anywhere that explicitly enumerated these (in absolute fairness, nobody does this 🙂), so I figured I would open this up for general review and consideration.\n\n### What did you expect to see?\n\nIn cases involving critical or out-of-policy extensions that crypto/x509 appears to otherwise ignore, I expected to see chain build failures rather than successes. However, see qualifications above 🙂 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/65085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/65085/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/2626151988","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/10247#issuecomment-2626151988","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10247","id":2626151988,"node_id":"IC_kwDOALYunM6ch-Y0","user":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-31T02:15:50Z","updated_at":"2025-01-31T02:15:50Z","body":"Our tentative plan is to not remove support for negative serial parsing until after https://crt.sh/?q=28903A635B5280FAE6774C0B6DA7D6BAA64AF2E8 is removed from the MS trust store.

However, according to RFC5280, the authorityCertSerialNumber field stores the certificate serial number, which must be a positive integer.So, is this a bug?\n\nCode:\n```\nfrom cryptography.x509 import load_pem_x509_crl, load_der_x509_crl\nfrom cryptography.x509 import ExtensionNotFound\nimport sys\n\ndef load_crl(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, \"rb\") as f:\n        crl_data = f.read()\n    try:\n        crl = load_pem_x509_crl(crl_data)\n    except ValueError:\n        crl = load_der_x509_crl(crl_data)\n    return crl\n\ndef print_crl_issuer(file_path):\n    crl=load_crl(file_path)\n    aki_extension = None\n    try:\n        for ext in crl.extensions:\n             if ext.oid == x509.oid.ExtensionOID.AUTHORITY_KEY_IDENTIFIER:\n                    aki=ext.value\n                    print(aki.authority_cert_issuer)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing CRL: {e}\")\n\nfile_path = 'crl_aki_serial_0.der'\nprint_crl_issuer(file_path)\n```\nTest Case:\n\n[crl_aki_serial_0.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19668466/crl_aki_serial_0.zip)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/12748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/12748/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17483276079,"node_id":"LOE_lADOALYunM59F9GhzwAAAAQSFZ8v","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/events/17483276079","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-01T03:24:58Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18527065490,"node_id":"SE_lADOALYunM59F9GhzwAAAARQTJWS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/events/18527065490","actor":{"login":"norrisjeremy","id":11465673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1Njcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/norrisjeremy","html_url":"https://github.com/norrisjeremy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norrisjeremy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norrisjeremy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norrisjeremy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norrisjeremy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norrisjeremy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norrisjeremy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norrisjeremy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norrisjeremy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/norrisjeremy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-08T13:49:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
