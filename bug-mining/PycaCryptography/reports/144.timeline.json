Description\r\n-- | --\r\nkeyIdentifier | MUST be present. MUST be identical to the subjectKeyIdentifier field.\r\nauthorityCertIssuer | MUST NOT be present\r\nauthorityCertSerialNumber | MUST NOT be present\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, RFC 5280 4.2.1.1 is much less prescriptive:\r\n\r\n> This profile RECOMMENDS support for the key identifier method by all\r\n> certificate users.\r\n\r\nx509-limbo also agrees that implementations other than PyCA's are overwhelmingly permissive of ACIs in root CA AKIs: <https://x509-limbo.com/testcases/webpki/#webpkiakiroot-with-aki-authoritycertissuer>\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I agree that this should be relaxed, similar to what we've done with other pedantic checks 🙂. I'll look into a patch today.\r\n\r\n(x509-limbo also has cases for root CAs with ACSNs, which PyCA is similarly strict about while other implementations permit it.

Known changes/fixes\r\n\r\n[Documentation of known changes](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/blob/96eb3fe712a45974bed75e6003f7e7def277161c/documentation/tls.md#changes-in-release-110)\r\n\r\nSpecific examples:\r\n- cbc.badssl.com web has good cipher order in the old code, but new implementation says it's bad for preferring TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256 (phase out) over TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (sufficient) - [SSL labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=cbc.badssl.com) and testssl confirm my new order detection.\r\n- ~~sidn.nl mx has TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA* which is insufficient and not detected by the old code~~\r\n- sidn.nl mx prefers TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384 over TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 which sufficient>good, not detected in old code. \r\n- github.com offers both ECDSA and RSA certificate and this causes two glitches in RSA authenticated ciphers that are not detected by testssl and ssllabs, nor the old code which counts it as good. First, it has TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 amongst others which is phase out. Second, it prefers [TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256 over TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256](https://gist.github.com/mxsasha/64bfc8c9f11cab7af6b825c33e501699) which is bad as AES-128-CBC is sufficient only in NCSC guidelines.\r\n- ad.nl has TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256, old test does not detect this\r\n- old test appears to sometimes miss OCSP stapling, but sees it on retry\r\n- ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305-OLD and ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305-OLD are not detected by the new test, along with possible other -OLD ciphers. Seen in milieucentraal.nl as example. The current openssl versions (1.0.2e and 1.1.1t) do not support it, neither does my local one, sslyze does not detect it, ssllabs and testssl do. If we strongly care about this, we need to run a custom openssl that adds these ciphers (with a custom nassl and sslyze).\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Review/refactoring\r\n- [x] Remove OpenSSL names from cipher names\r\n- [x] Update to latest cryptography for relaxed AKI checks for correct certificate trust\r\n- [x] Try to migrate to non-custom sslyze and nassl, or at least make sure patched versions are properly included.\r\n- [x] Investigate re-adding -OLD ciphers.\r\n- [x] After #1578 is merged: clean up the use of cb_data dicts for DANE.\r\n- [ ] Try to revert the revert of pip\r\n- [ ] Clean up commit history\r\n\r\nChangelog/API changes are in #1800 \r\n\r\n## Required content updates\r\n\r\nSee [content PR](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl_content/pull/58)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/1218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/1218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15343087317,"node_id":"LOE_lADOALYunM6TjUrzzwAAAAOShO7V","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/events/15343087317","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-19T03:13:18Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
