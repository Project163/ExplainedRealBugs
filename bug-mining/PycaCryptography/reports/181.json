The serializer outputs a string that `Name.from_rfc4514_string()` cannot parse, so the round-trip guarantee is broken.\n\n```python\nfrom cryptography.x509 import Name\nfrom cryptography.x509.name import NameAttribute\nfrom cryptography.x509.oid import NameOID\n\nname = Name([NameAttribute(NameOID.COMMON_NAME, \"0\"),\n             NameAttribute(NameOID.ORGANIZATION_NAME, \" \")])\ns = name.rfc4514_string()          # yields \"CN=0,O=\\\\ \"\nName.from_rfc4514_string(s)        # raises ValueError\n```\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/data/src/test.py\", line 8, in <module>\n    Name.from_rfc4514_string(s)        # raises ValueError\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/py312/lib/python3.12/site-packages/cryptography/x509/name.py\", line 316, in from_rfc4514_string\n    return _RFC4514NameParser(data, attr_name_overrides or {}).parse()\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/py312/lib/python3.12/site-packages/cryptography/x509/name.py\", line 442, in parse\n    self._read_char(\",\")\n  File \"/home/py312/lib/python3.12/site-packages/cryptography/x509/name.py\", line 415, in _read_char\n    raise ValueError\nValueError\n```\n\nFC 4514 requires trailing spaces to be escaped as `\\` . Here I emit `\\` (two backslashes plus space), which the parser rejects. \nAlthough it  is uncommon that the organization's name is just a space, any application relying on round-tripping—certificate tooling, directory synchronization, or sanitation of existing DNs with trailing spaces will hit this failure. A crafted DN from untrusted input could also trigger unexpected crashes.\n\n## Versions tested on:\n46.0.3\n\n## Operating systems tested on:\nLinux\n","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/13843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/13843/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
