Cryptography successfully parsed this serial number without any errors. However, according to RFC 5280, the certificate serial number must be a non-negative integer. At the same time, tests show that cryptography will reject the parsing of revoked certificates with negative serial numbers.\n\n\nCode:\n```\nfrom cryptography.x509 import load_pem_x509_crl, load_der_x509_crl\nfrom cryptography.x509 import ExtensionNotFound\nimport sys\n\ndef load_crl(file_path):\n    with open(file_path, \"rb\") as f:\n        crl_data = f.read()\n    try:\n        crl = load_pem_x509_crl(crl_data)\n    except ValueError:\n        crl = load_der_x509_crl(crl_data)\n    return crl\n\ndef print_crl_issuer(file_path):\n    crl=load_crl(file_path)\n    try:\n        for entry in crl:\n               print(entry)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error occurred: {e}\")\n\nfile_path = 'crl_revoked_serial_0.der'\nprint_crl_issuer(file_path)\n```\nTest Case:\n\n[crl_revoked_serial_0.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19759738/crl_revoked_serial_0.zip)\n\nAnother Test Case:\n\n[crl_revoked_serial_-24.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19759747/crl_revoked_serial_-24.zip)","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/12771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/12771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
