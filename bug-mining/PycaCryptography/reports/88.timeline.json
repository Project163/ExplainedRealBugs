I'm fine with changing this to simply not use error codes from the `lib` object though, as they're not stable and the purpose of the test is to see if we can push an error on stack and then read it off again to get the same values. We don't specifically care what that error is.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/1056121379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6312902107,"node_id":"REFE_lADOALYunM5E2YkezwAAAAF4Rz3b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/events/6312902107","actor":{"login":"alex","id":772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex","html_url":"https://github.com/alex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d3fa9bc4a36a2a8644ab3e69167c84e47e2f3518","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alex/cryptography/commits/d3fa9bc4a36a2a8644ab3e69167c84e47e2f3518","created_at":"2022-03-27T01:34:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6312909313,"node_id":"REFE_lADOALYunM5E2YkezwAAAAF4R1oB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/events/6312909313","actor":{"login":"alex","id":772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex","html_url":"https://github.com/alex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2c1227c3d9a7d524af50cd0a72ede8118ad9371f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alex/cryptography/commits/2c1227c3d9a7d524af50cd0a72ede8118ad9371f","created_at":"2022-03-27T01:40:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6312918155,"node_id":"CE_lADOALYunM5E2YkezwAAAAF4R3yL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/events/6312918155","actor":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"dc937f8ab36499da0bd15d8f2180a841fab0bfb0","commit_url":"htt
