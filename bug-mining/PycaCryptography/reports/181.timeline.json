I think the problem is on the serialization side.\nIf you run the repro and inspect the actual characters that `rfc4514_string()` returns, you’ll see there are two backslashes:\n```python\nfrom cryptography.x509 import Name\nfrom cryptography.x509.name import NameAttribute\nfrom cryptography.x509.oid import NameOID\n\nname = Name([NameAttribute(NameOID.ORGANIZATION_NAME, \" \")])\ns = name.rfc4514_string()\n\nprint(s)                   # shows `O=\\\\ ` because Python escapes backslashes\nprint(list(s))             # ['O', '=', '\\\\', '\\\\', ' ']  ← two backslashes\nprint([ord(c) for c in s]) # […, 92, 92, 32]\n```\nRFC 4514 says a trailing space must be encoded as one backslash followed by a space. We’re emitting two backslashes plus space, which is not a valid escape sequence, so `from_rfc4514_string()` quite rightly rejects it. In other words, the parse failure is a consequence of `rfc4514_string()` producing non‑compliant output in this edge case.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/3508443038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"T90REAL","id":88570037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NTcwMDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88570037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/T90REAL","html_url":"https://github.com/T90REAL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/T90REAL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/T90REAL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/T90REAL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/T90REAL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/T90REAL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/T90REAL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/T90REAL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/T90REAL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/T90REAL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/3508444908","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/13843#issuecomment-3508444908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/13843","id":3508444908,"node_id":"IC_kwDOALYunM7RHp7s","user":{"login":"alex","id":772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex","html_url":"https://github.com/alex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-11-09T15:15:58Z","updated_at":"2025-11-09T15:15:58Z","body":"Ah, I see the bug.
