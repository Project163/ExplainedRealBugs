This then makes the signature validation on the CRL fail (tried using both `tbs_certlist_bytes` and `is_signature_valid`).\r\n\r\nNot a big deal (I'm guessing most will verify the signature on the CRL before checking if the certificate is in it), but I'm thinking a note in the documentation would be nice. I scratched my head quite a bit before understanding why a previously good CRL suddenly failed signature validation :-)\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"alex","id":772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex","html_url":"https://github.com/alex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/4456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/4456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
