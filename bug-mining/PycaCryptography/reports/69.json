This is a messy topic at he very least:\r\n- because there are many implementations incomplete in such a way out there, relying on >64bits OIDs is a bad idea\r\n- ...so fixing it here is unlikely to do much good\r\n- ...except for existing implementations which were not aware of this lack of support, in which case propagating the lack of support (=breaking >64bits oids in `cryptography`) will complicate the upgrade path\r\n\r\nFor my personal use cases, I was kind of lucky that I discovered the issue before support was dropped in `cryptography`, and I believe all impacted certificates have been long migrated. It is my automated testing of this very migration codepath which detected the breakage in `cryptography`, so I guess I have to at least skip this test when parsing fails.\r\n\r\nIf this bug was at 63 or 64bits, I would sugest resolving it by just (retroactively ?) listing this breakage in the changelog. But seeing that this happens with OIDs well under 64bits makes me think a fix is needed.\r\n\r\nOf course, if such fix can also add support for 128bits OIDs, it is even better, but I do not know if it is necessary.\r\n\r\nVersions:\r\n- Python: 3.9.2\r\n- cryptography: 35.0.0 (installed with pip in a virtualenv)\r\n- cffi: 1.15.0\r\n- pip: 21.3.1\r\n- setuptools: 58.5.3\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom cryptography import x509\r\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import rsa\r\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization, hashes\r\n\r\nLONG_UUID = 2**128 - 1\r\nLONG_OID = '2.25.%i' % (LONG_UUID, )\r\nSHORT_OID = '2.25.%i' % (LONG_UUID & (2**28 - 1), )\r\ntest_private_key = rsa.generate_private_key(public_exponent=65537, key_size=2048)\r\ndef makeAndLoadCSR(oid):\r\n    extension = x509.CertificatePolicies([\r\n        x509.PolicyInformation(x509.oid.ObjectIdentifier(oid), None),\r\n    ])\r\n    csr_pem = x509.CertificateSigningRequestBuilder(\r\n        subject_name=x509.Name([x509.NameAttribute(oid=x509.oid.NameOID.COMMON_NAME, value='test')]),\r\n    ).add_extension(extension, critical=False).sign(\r\n        private_key=test_private_key,\r\n        algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),\r\n    ).public_bytes(encoding=serialization.Encoding.PEM)\r\n    _ = x509.load_pem_x509_csr(csr_pem).extensions\r\n\r\n# this succeeds\r\nmakeAndLoadCSR(SHORT_OID)\r\n# this fails\r\nmakeAndLoadCSR(LONG_OID)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput of the last statement above when the issue is present:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 14, in makeAndLoadCSR\r\nValueError: error parsing asn1 value: ParseError { kind: InvalidValue, location: [\"0\", \"PolicyInformation::policy_identifier\"] }\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/6573/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/6573/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
