But this number is incorrect, as the maximum size actually is **2<sup>31</sup> - 1 bytes**. This can be seen if the example code is applied with large data:\r\n``` python\r\nimport os\r\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM\r\ndata = b\"a\" * 2**31\r\naad = b\"authenticated but unencrypted data\"\r\nkey = AESGCM.generate_key(bit_length=128)\r\naesgcm = AESGCM(key)\r\nnonce = os.urandom(12)\r\nct = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, data, aad)\r\n```\r\nyields an error:\r\n```\r\nOverflowError: integer 2147483648 does not fit '32-bit int'\r\n```\r\nThis applies to all three encryption schemes: `ChaCha20Poly1305`, `AESGCM` and `AESCCM`, and for `data` as well as the `associated data`.  \r\n\r\nRelates to https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5003#","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/6486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/6486/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
