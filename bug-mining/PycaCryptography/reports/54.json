I've hit one of those in an old post on StackOverflow.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely easy to fix this as RTD has a setting that makes automatic redirects to cater such migrations! Just go to https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/cryptography/redirects/ and select `Sphinx HTMLDir -> HTML` in the `Redirect type:` dropdown. That's it, just add that and this problem will be fixed.","closed_by":{"login":"alex","id":772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex","html_url":"https://github.com/alex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
