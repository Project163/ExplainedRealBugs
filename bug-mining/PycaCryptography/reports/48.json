If there wasn't, anything speaking against making that change (I would create a PR).\r\n\r\nMaking Extension a generic class would allow more precise type hints, for a (very simplified, just to get the point across) example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef get_pathlen(ext: x509.Extension[x509.BasicConstraints]) -> int:\r\n    return ext.value.path_length  # this works now\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike I said, if you think this is a good idea, I can definitely create a PR for this!","closed_by":{"login":"alex","id":772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex","html_url":"https://github.com/alex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5830/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
