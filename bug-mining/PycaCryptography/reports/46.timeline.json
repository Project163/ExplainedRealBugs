to build cryptography from sources? At least [on RTD](https://readthedocs.org/projects/python-telegram-bot/builds/12968269/)\r\n* There is currently a heavy discussion in progress in pyca/cryptography#5771 as apparently the usage of Rust code in v3.4 has broken CIs of a lot of people\r\n\r\nWe'll need to check out\r\n\r\n* How this affects our building process\r\n* How we can reasonably protect our users from install problems. Mind you, installation problems of 3rd party deps is not fully our problem, but if the majority of our users can't install it, then our package is worthless.\r\n\r\nOne could just pin cryptography to
