In contrast, there are some bindings, such as RSA-OAEP with SHA2 hashes, that [in the absence of bindings] only fail when you try to use them rather than when you try to load the backend. Our end-goal here is for pyca/cryptography to exhibit this later behavior for any features that can be disabled in the standard OpenSSL build.\r\n\r\nWe realize that this is probably a bit of a niche use case, as I assume that the majority of pyca/cryptography users just use the wheels and their included binaries, but this is a use case that we need to support and we would like to work with you all to get pyca/cryptography to a point where it does.\r\n\r\nWe don't have a timeline on when we'll be able to start digging into this, but we wanted to get the conversation started to begin scoping the level of effort needed to address this as well as to start enumerating what changes will need to be made where.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/581628655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mattsb42-aws","id":23565203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTY1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23565203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsb42-aws","html_url":"https://github.com/mattsb42-aws","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsb42-aws/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsb42-aws/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsb42-aws/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsb42-aws/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsb42-aws/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsb42-aws/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsb42-aws/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsb42-aws/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsb42-aws/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/583868441","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5113#issuecomment-583868441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5113","id":583868441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4Mzg2ODQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-09T17:02:52Z","updated_at":"2020-02-09T17:02:52Z","body":"Ah, gotcha.

OpenSSL treats this as something similar to `CFLAGS` you would set to control optimization - notably, it does not cause `#define OPENSSL_NO_SRTP` to show up in `<openssl/opensslconf.h>`, so there's no way for a consuming package to detect at compilation time that SRTP related symbols don't exist, and you're stuck detecting it at (dynamic) link time. `no-srtp` is the correct replacement, and does the right thing. We actually had a number of these options set internally; migrating them to the `no-*` variants fixed all of our missing symbol errors except those related to SRTP.\r\n\r\nTwo, `no-srtp` just needed some pretty straightforward work in the relevant FFI source's `CUSTOMIZATIONS` block and in `cryptography.hazmat.bindings.openssl._conditional`. I'm sending a PR for this shortly.\r\n\r\nOn the no-ct issue (#5067) I suspect it's probably just missing a check for `OPENSSL_NO_CT` [here](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/master/src/_cffi_src/openssl/ct.py#L68). I don't have much experience running with this configuration, personally, but `<openssl/ct.h>` basically guards its entire contents on it, so I imagine that's the problem.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/662203479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"omnigrok","id":820051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDA1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/820051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok","html_url":"https://github.com/omnigrok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3573810489,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM1NzM4MTA0ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/events/3573810489","actor":{"login":"omnigrok","id":820051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDA1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/820051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok","html_url":"https://github.com/omnigrok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f2679d77a0adaf17eec1fd0525f7cc14b48fc3a0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/omnigrok/cryptography/commits/f2679d77a0adaf17eec1fd0525f7cc14b48fc3a0","created_at":"2020-07-22T02:24:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"omnigrok","id":820051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDA1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/820051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok","html_url":"https://github.com/omnigrok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omnigrok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-22T02:30:29Z","updated_at":"2020-07-22T02:30:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5338","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5338/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5338/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5338/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/5338","id":663426253,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDU0ODQyMTM5","number":5338,"title":"fixes
