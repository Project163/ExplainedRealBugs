https://github.com/pypa/packaging.python.org/pull/877\r\n\r\nWhat happened in both cases was that the projects have `dirhtml` builder set in the web UI but then, they wanted to _only_ change specific properties of the build envs (without touching other settings) so they added the following configs to their repos to do just chage:\r\n```yaml\r\n# .readthedocs.yml\r\n\r\nversion: 2\r\n\r\nsphinx:\r\n  configuration: source/conf.py\r\n\r\npython:\r\n  version: 3.8\r\n```\r\n```yaml\r\n# .readthedocs.yml\r\n\r\nversion: 2\r\n\r\nbuild:\r\n  image: \"7.0\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected Result\r\n\r\n`sphinx.builder` is unset so the implicit expectation was that the one set earlier in the web UI would still be used.\r\n\r\n## Actual Result\r\n\r\n`sphinx.builder` was set to `html` without any warnings/notifications.\r\n\r\n## How to improve this\r\n\r\nI think, there are a few things RTD could do to make this situation better:\r\n1. Add a big red warning to https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html explaining how this works.\r\n2. Print out an explanation on how the config is constructed to the build logs.\r\n3. Merge the config file with the settings in the UI, overriding only specific options that have been explicitly requested via the config.\r\n4. Or at least grey out all of the settings in the UI with an explanation that the config file in the repo now controls those and UI changes are disabled.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/8092/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/8092/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/817850369","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5863#issuecomment-817850369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5863","id":817850369,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNzg1MDM2OQ==","user":{"login":"webknjaz","id":578543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODU0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/578543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz","html_url":"https://github.com/webknjaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webknjaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-12T14:15:59Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T14:15:59Z","body":"Upstream
