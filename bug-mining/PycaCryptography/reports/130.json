I built from 00a94b00 this morning for testing with python 3.12, and I built with \"python -m build\".  I then installed the wheel into my aioquic test environment.\r\n\r\nI did not see this change listed in the list of breaking changes and figure it might have snuck in unintentionally.\r\n\r\nHere is a comparison between 41.0.7 and main:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# cryptography 41.0.7\r\n\r\n>>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec, ed448, ed25519, rsa\r\n>>> key = ec.generate_private_key(ec.SECP256R1)\r\n>>> key.curve \r\n<cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.SECP256R1 object at 0x102da2840>\r\n>>> isinstance(key.curve, ec.SECP256R1)\r\nTrue\r\n>>> key.curve is ec.SECP256R1  \r\nFalse\r\n\r\n\r\n# cryptography main\r\n\r\n>>> from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric import ec, ed448, ed25519, rsa\r\n>>> key = ec.generate_private_key(ec.SECP256R1)\r\n>>> key.curve\r\n<class 'cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.SECP256R1'>\r\n>>> isinstance(key.curve, ec.SECP256R1)\r\nFalse\r\n>>> key.curve is ec.SECP256R1\r\nTrue\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
