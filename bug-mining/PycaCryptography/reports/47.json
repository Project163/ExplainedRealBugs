I propose that we **switch to a [CalVer](https://calver.org) scheme** for the thirty fifth feature release (which we currently would call 3.5). This has the advantage of being unambiguously not semantic versioning but encoding some vaguely useful information (the year of release) in it.\r\n\r\n### Alternate Choices\r\n**Stay the course**\r\nWe've successfully used our versioning scheme for a bit over 7 years now and the probability of another monumental shift like this is low. There is, however, a constant (but low) background radiation of people who are tripped up by making assumptions about our versioning so I would argue against this choice.\r\n\r\n**SemVer**\r\nSwitch to using an actual semantic versioning scheme. Without re-litigating years of conversations, I don't believe either @alex or myself are interested in this option. (See https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5801#issuecomment-776067787 for a bit of elaboration on our position)\r\n\r\n**Firefox/Chrome Versioning**\r\n(From @alex)\r\n\"Its merits are that it's technically semver compatible, it's fairly predictable, and it communicates at least a little info on the relative age of the project.\r\n\r\nIts demerits are that it probably won't solve the real problem here, which was that folks were surprised a major change happened at all.\"","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5801/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
