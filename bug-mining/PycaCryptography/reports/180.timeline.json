@alex  \r\nIs this up for taking? \r\n\r\n### How I plan to implement this:\r\n\r\nTaking Certificate class as an example :\r\n\r\n[Link to

Certificate(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):`\r\n\r\nRemoving ```(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta)``` and  adding it as new-style class \r\n```class Certificate: ```\r\n\r\nAddressing the changes further:\r\n\r\nRemove `@abc.abstractmethod Decorators` \r\n\r\nthen \r\n\r\nRemove `@abc.abstractproperty` with  `@property`\r\n\r\nthen \r\nRetain Property Decorators (@property) Where Needed\r\n\r\nI am bit confused on how to Implement methods and properties here should return as here of find the linked function it sounds a bit ddumb I know but I think with little direction I can pull this off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me know if I am missing something or wrong somewhere, I'll try to cover those cases again and revert back \r\nThanks for
