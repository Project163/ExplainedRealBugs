observing a weird behavior when signing with S/MIME since version 39.0.0: it seems like an additional \"Content-Type: text/plain\" is added to the message after signing it.\r\n\r\nMy code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom cryptography import x509\r\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes, serialization\r\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization import pkcs7\r\n\r\nwith open(\"test.cert\", \"rb\") as cc:\r\n    cert = x509.load_pem_x509_certificate(cc.read())\r\n\r\nwith open(\"test.key\", \"rb\") as ck:\r\n    key = serialization.load_pem_private_key(ck.read(), None)\r\n\r\nmsg = \"test\"\r\n\r\noptions = [pkcs7.PKCS7Options.DetachedSignature, pkcs7.PKCS7Options.Text]\r\n\r\nsigned_msg = (\r\n    pkcs7.PKCS7SignatureBuilder()\r\n    .set_data(bytes(msg, \"utf-8\"))\r\n    .add_signer(cert, key, hashes.SHA256())\r\n    .sign(serialization.Encoding.SMIME, options)\r\n)\r\n\r\nwith open(\"/tmp/msg.txt\", \"wb\") as msg_file:\r\n    msg_file.write(signed_msg)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `cryptography 38.0.4`, the relevant part is\r\n```\r\nThis is an S/MIME signed message\r\n\r\n------A78EE028A05FC73322259A20ED9EAAAE\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\ntest\r\n------A78EE028A05FC73322259A20ED9EAAAE\r\n```\r\nand `openssl smime -verify -in /tmp/msg.txt -noverify` is successful.\r\n\r\nWith `cryptography 39.0.0`, I get\r\n```\r\nThis is an S/MIME signed message\r\n\r\n--===============0873037622973214044==\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\n\r\ntest\r\n--===============0873037622973214044==\r\n```\r\nand the verification with `openssl` fails.\r\nAfter manually removing the additional \"Content-Type: text/plain\" from the file, it succeeds again.","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/8298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/8298/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
