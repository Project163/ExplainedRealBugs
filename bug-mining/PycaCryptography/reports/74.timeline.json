is another try to implement #5002 (Support for getting ASN.1 value for parsed extensions). \r\n\r\nIt uses the existing backend function `_create_x509_extension()` to convert a extension created for this extension value to an OpenSSL extension, and then uses the same code as in https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/70ccc2542cf3bf374861b55f6527424307722763/src/cryptography/hazmat/backends/openssl/decode_asn1.py#L239-L242 to extract the extension's value. As a handler map it uses the union of all handler maps in `encode_asn1.py` (I checked that the same OID in different mappings are mapped to the same function, in case someone wonders).\r\n\r\nIf the general approach looks good, I can add documentation and tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/6346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/6346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5648182666,"node_id":"LE_lADOALYunM4-nymdzwAAAAFQqG2K","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/events/5648182666","actor":{"login":"alex","id":772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex","html_url":"https://github.com/alex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-19T23:33:58Z","label":{"name":"x509","color":"fef2c0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6026812658,"node_id":"MIE_lADOALYunM4-nymdzwAAAAFnOdzy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/events/6026812658","actor":{"login":"alex","id":772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex","html_url":"https://github.com/alex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-08T13:31:13Z","milestone":{"title":"Thirty
