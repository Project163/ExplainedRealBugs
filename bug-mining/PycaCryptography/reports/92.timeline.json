My own concern is specifically that I am unwilling to silently leave 15% of users out in the cold. We are a core dependency for a huge part of the Python ecosystem and while we are quite aggressive in driving upgrades where we can, telling 15% of our user base that they need to upgrade to 3.7+ in this case is simply too much \"breakage\" for people who depend on
