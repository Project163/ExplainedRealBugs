I assume that this is due to them being ported to Rust (which is not at all mentioned in the changelog, btw :-(). One example I have found is `ObjectIdentifier`, but I assume there may be others:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import copy\r\n>>> from cryptography import x509\r\n>>> copy.copy(x509.NameOID.COMMON_NAME)\r\n...\r\nTypeError: cannot pickle 'builtins.ObjectIdentifier' object\r\n>>> copy.deepcopy(x509.NameOID.COMMON_NAME)\r\n...\r\nTypeError: cannot pickle 'builtins.ObjectIdentifier' object\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can easily cause problems in Python code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> class Test:\r\n...     def __init__(self, oid):\r\n...         self.oid = oid\r\n>>> copy.deepcopy(Test(x509.NameOID.COMMON_NAME))\r\n...\r\nTypeError: cannot pickle 'builtins.ObjectIdentifier' object\r\n>>> copy.deepcopy({x509.NameOID.COMMON_NAME: 'CommonName'})\r\n...\r\nTypeError: cannot pickle 'builtins.ObjectIdentifier' object\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works in cryptography==37.0.4:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> copy.deepcopy({x509.NameOID.COMMON_NAME: 'CommonName'})\r\n{<ObjectIdentifier(oid=2.5.4.3, name=commonName)>: 'CommonName'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [copy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html) module says that implementing __copy__/__deepcopy__ would fix the issue (so no, no pickle required).\r\n\r\nCan we implement this again? I'm not a Rust developer, but I'm willing to try of course.","closed_by":{"login":"alex","id":772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex","html_url":"https://github.com/alex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/7587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/7587/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
