Overview\n\nThe documentation for the `DSAPublicKey` and `DSAPrivateKey` (`hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/dsa`) currently (`45.0.3`) has an incorrect description of the `key_size` attribute.\n\n- [dsa.DSAPublicKey](https://cryptography.io/en/45.0.3/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/dsa/#cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.dsa.DSAPublicKey)\n- [dsa.DSAPrivateKey](https://cryptography.io/en/45.0.3/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/dsa/#cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.dsa.DSAPrivateKey)\n\nInstead of the incorrect `q` (subgroup order), must be `p` (prime modulus).\n\n\n## Description in documentation: Incorrect\n\n### DSAPublicKey\n\n```rst\n.. class:: DSAPublicKey\n\n\t.. versionadded:: 0.3\n\n\tA `DSA`_ public key.\n\n\t.. attribute:: key_size\n\n\t\t:type: int\n\n\t\tThe bit length of :attr:`~DSAParameterNumbers.q`.\n```\n\nCorrect attribute description must be:\n\n```rst\nThe bit length of :attr:`~DSAParameterNumbers.p`.\n```\n\nSource:\n\n- [dsa.rst#L350](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/247c09cc5777ee1ff5fe2a86cfe62ef328d45b2e/docs/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/dsa.rst?plain=1#L350)\n\n\n### DSAPrivateKey\n\n```rst\n.. class::

[dsa.rst#L280](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/247c09cc5777ee1ff5fe2a86cfe62ef328d45b2e/docs/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/dsa.rst?plain=1#L280)\n\n\n## Description in Python code: OK\n\n```py\nclass DSAPublicKey(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):\n\t@property\n\t@abc.abstractmethod\n\tdef key_size(self) -> int:\n\t\t\"\"\"\n\t\tThe bit length of the prime

OK\n\n```rust\nfn key_size(&self) -> i32 {\n\tself.pkey.dsa().unwrap().p().num_bits()\n}\n```\n\nSource:\n- [dsa.rs#L91](https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/247c09cc5777ee1ff5fe2a86cfe62ef328d45b2e/src/rust/src/backend/dsa.rs#L91)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe incorrect description of the `key_size` attribute currently exists only in the documentation.\n\nDocumentation must be fixed: instead of the incorrect `q` (subgroup order), must be `p` (prime modulus).\n\nCorrect attribute description must be:\n\n```rst\n\t.. attribute:: key_size\n\n\t\t:type: int\n\n\t\tThe bit length of
