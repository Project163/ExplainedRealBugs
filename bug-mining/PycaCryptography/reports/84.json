For a script/function that would vet the CSR's extensions to see which ones should be included and which ones should not, we would need to be able to parse the extensions. Eg. CSR has been signed requesting for ServerAuth KeyUsage, or data_encipherment. But the CA, would want to verify if that is truly needed or not, and would reject the CSR if not correct.\r\n2. Also, to more align with the documenation that would return the extensions object.\r\n\r\nPrior related issues; #6872 \r\n\r\nIn #6872 the Certificate.extensions was not accessible due to the parse error. However, in this case, we have a valid scenario where we may need to access the extensions for the CertificateSigningRequest, even if for tallying the extensions themselves. For example, when we get a csr from an external entity, and we would want to tally the extensions after loading it into the python program using load_csr\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/6926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/6926/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
