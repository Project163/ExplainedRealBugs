It returns ExtensionType, so you basically need to downcast to a specific extension type before you access fields in what it returns. In my case, I was getting back an UnrecognizedExtension and wanted to access the raw value bytes, but \"value\" didn't exist in ExtensionType.\r\n\r\nThe original code was something
