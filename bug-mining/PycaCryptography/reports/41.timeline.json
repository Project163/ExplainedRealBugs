this is necessary). You can see examples of that handling in various binding files and the logic we use to remove null func pointers from the lib is in `_conditional.py`.\r\n2) A PR to pyOpenSSL that adds methods to use these bindings (and switches to calling TLS_method in the tests probably). That PR will fail the tests (except for the cryptography master branch tests) until we do a release, but those master branch tests can confirm you've implemented it properly.\r\n\r\nThe latter is a requirement because maintaining an arbitrarily large set of bindings without knowing consumers turns out to be prohibitively difficult.

PR addresses the **TLS_method** issues presented in Issue #5379\r\n\r\nThis patch will allow developers to use the newer TLS_method interface name, allowing them to write code that is compatible with future iterations of the OpenSSL library and its interfaces/conventions as they emerge, and will reduce false positives in static analysis tools which flag deprecated SSL/TLS modes.\r\n\r\nAdded mapping of TLS_Method to SSLv23_method (the opposite of what OpenSSL project did for backwards compatibility). The rationale is that since SSLv23_method gets mapped to TLS_method during compiler preprocessing, this will not break newer versions of the Cryptography package that user newer versions of OpenSSL (because SSLv23_method = TLS_method), while simultaneously providing the TLS_method interface via CFFI for all versions of the Cryptography package (including versions that __only__ have SSLv23_method) (in this case, TLS_method = SSLv23_method)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5428/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/680288416","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5379#issuecomment-680288416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5379","id":680288416,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MDI4ODQxNg==","user":{"login":"th3b0x","id":3495642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTU2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3495642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x","html_url":"https://github.com/th3b0x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-25T21:53:55Z","updated_at":"2020-08-25T22:02:37Z","body":"Edit: looks like it didn't handle correctly on OpenSSL 1.0.2 for some reason, have to check my local environment.\r\n\r\n@reaperhulk I've put #5428 in to address the **TLS_method** related issues.

PR.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/704514903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"th3b0x","id":3495642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTU2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3495642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x","html_url":"https://github.com/th3b0x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3847285850,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg0NzI4NTg1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/events/3847285850","actor":{"login":"richvdh","id":1389908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODk5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1389908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh","html_url":"https://github.com/richvdh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-06T19:49:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3847285852,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4NDcyODU4NTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/events/3847285852","actor":{"login":"richvdh","id":1389908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODk5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1389908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh","html_url":"https://github.com/richvdh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richvdh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-06T19:49:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"th3b0x","id":3495642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTU2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3495642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x","html_url":"https://github.com/th3b0x","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/th3b0x/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-10T00:00:29Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T00:00:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5483","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5483/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/5483/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issu
