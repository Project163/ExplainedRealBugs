I found that we were passing the class in one place in our test suite.  If I change that to an instance, then it works on both.  I can accept this is \"our bad\", but it might be worth considering doing \"what you always did\" on the return value in case others are having similar confusion between instances and classes.\r\n\r\nThanks for the super fast response.\r\n\r\nI'll leave it to you to decide if you want to change something or just close the ticket, and will fix our test to use the instance.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/1892412784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rthalley","id":78507,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78507?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rthalley","html_url":"https://github.com/rthalley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rthalley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rthalley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rthalley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rthalley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rthalley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rthalley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rthalley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rthalley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rthalley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/1892418358","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/10187#issuecomment-1892418358","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10187","id":1892418358,"node_id":"IC_kwDOALYunM5wzAM2","user":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-15T15:51:15Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T15:51:15Z","body":"I think we should fix this Alex.
