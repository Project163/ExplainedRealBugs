These algorithms have a variety of security drawbacks when compared to more modern equivalents (namely AES or ChaCha20) and generally shouldn't be used. We plan to deprecate them on a long cycle such that users have a chance to speak up if they have a use case that we should consider.\r\n\r\nThe algorithms we'd like to deprecate and remove are:\r\n* CAST5\r\n* SEED\r\n* IDEA\r\n* Blowfish\r\n\r\n3DES and ARC4 are also legacy (and ARC4 has serious security issues), but their common use in many scenarios means they will not be deprecated.","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/6809/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/6809/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
