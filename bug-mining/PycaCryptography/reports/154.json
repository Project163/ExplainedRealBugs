Depending on the answer, this might be a feature request or a bug report.\r\nI'm trying to create well formed and well behaved certificates under a custom CA + intermediate cert.\r\n\r\nWildcards are not meant to be used in the intermediate cert. (https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/8253)\r\n\r\nBut then, (how) can i achieve something like:\r\n```\r\nexample.lan, *.example.lan  <- Cert\r\n*.lan                       <- Intermediate (alternatively, better: example.lan, *.example.lan, example2.lan, *.example2.lan, ...)\r\n*                           <- CA\r\n```\r\nI'd assume the CA has to have no nameConstraints.\r\nBut what to do with the intermediate then?\r\n\r\nAllowing `DNS:lan` leads to: Certificate is NOT Trusted: validation failed: candidates exhausted: unsatisfiable DNS name constraint: malformed SAN *.example.lan\r\nAllowing `DNS:.lan` leads to: Certificate is NOT Trusted: validation failed: candidates exhausted: malformed DNS name constraint: .lan\r\nAllowing `DNS:*.lan` leads to: permitted subtree violation (by OpenSSL during creation)\r\nAllowing `DNS:example.lan` leads to: Certificate is NOT Trusted: validation failed: candidates exhausted: unsatisfiable DNS name constraint: malformed SAN *.example.lan\r\nAllowing `DNS:example.lan` + `DNS:.example.lan` leads to: Certificate is NOT Trusted: validation failed: candidates exhausted: unsatisfiable DNS name constraint: malformed SAN *.example.lan\r\nAllowing `DNS:example.lan` + `DNS:*.example.lan` leads to: Certificate is NOT Trusted: validation failed: candidates exhausted: unsatisfiable DNS name constraint: malformed SAN *.example.lan\r\n\r\nAre you sure we can/want to disallow wildcards in the constraints?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alex","id":772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex","html_url":"https://github.com/alex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/12250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/12250/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
