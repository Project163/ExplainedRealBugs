This is good and proper. However, we can make this safer. Right now if you're running Python at early boot, when the CSPRNG isn't seeded, and you don't have `getrandom`, we'll read unseeded crap from `/dev/urandom`.\r\n\r\nWe can solve this by doing `select([open(\"/dev/random\")], [], [])` first. This will ensure that `/dev/random` is ready (that is, has been seeded and has entropy available): https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/char/random.c#L1905\r\n\r\nThis is slightly overly aggressive, in that if some other process is sucking all the juice out of `/dev/random`, we'll block excessively, but there's no way around that.","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/4645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/4645/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
