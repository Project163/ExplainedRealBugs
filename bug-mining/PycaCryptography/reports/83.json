That means that SHA-1 signatures are blocked even in non-FIPS mode.\r\n\r\nDuring testing we found a problem in the error check of ``EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_signature_md()``. https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/blob/3fd9d5a8424eef3e08260a622ae3644777ac5339/src/cryptography/hazmat/backends/openssl/rsa.py#L198-L213\r\n\r\n``_rsa_sig_setup`` checks for ``res == 0`` but ``EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_signature_md`` can [return a negative value](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man3.0/man3/EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_signature_md.html):\r\n\r\n> All other functions described on this page return a positive value for success and 0 or a negative value for failure.
