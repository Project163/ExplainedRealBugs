issue is possibly related to #10808, which observes a similar behavior for AES-GCM-SIV.\r\n\r\nI'm using python version 3.12.3\r\nand  cryptography version 42.0.5\r\n\r\nThe following code\r\n```\r\nfrom cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import aead\r\nimport cryptography\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\ndef test_empty_pt():\r\n    key = bytes(range(32))\r\n    nonce = bytes(range(12))\r\n    pt = b\"\"\r\n    aads = [b\"row1\", b\"col2\", b\"timestamp\"]\r\n    crypter = aead.AESSIV(key)\r\n    ct = crypter.encrypt(pt, aads)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    print(f\"{sys.version=}\")\r\n    print(f\"{cryptography.__version__=}\")\r\n    test_empty_pt()\r\n\r\n```\r\ngives the following result:\r\n\r\n> \r\n> sys.version='3.12.3 (tags/v3.12.3:f6650f9, Apr  9 2024, 14:05:25) [MSC v.1938 64 bit (AMD64)]'\r\n> cryptography.__version__='42.0.5'\r\n> Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n>   File \".../aes_siv_test.py\", line 16, in <module>\r\n>     test_empty_pt()\r\n>   File \".../aes_siv_test.py\", line 11, in test_empty_pt\r\n>     ct = crypter.encrypt(pt, aads)\r\n> ValueError: data must not be zero length\r\n> \r\n>\r\n\r\nThe only restriction I could find is RFC 5297, section 6, where there is a lower bound of 1 byte for the nonce, when AES-SIV is being used as AEAD. However, AES-SIV is useful in many contexts, e.g., deterministically encrypting cells in a database using row and column as AAD. For such uses it would be helpful if all fields can be empty.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10958/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/comments/2241185005","html_url":"https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/10808#issuecomment-2241185005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10808","id":2241185005,"node_id":"IC_kwDOALYunM6FlcTt","user":{"login":"alex","id":772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex","html_url":"https://github.com/alex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-20T15:30:16Z","updated_at":"2024-07-20T15:30:16Z","body":"Note:
