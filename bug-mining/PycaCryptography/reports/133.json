Reproducible on Python 3.11, but probably the same issue exists everywhere (I can rerun my CI in fail-late mode if needed). From what I can tell, the breaking change was introduced here, in the initial migration of this code to Rust: https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/f38eb4a0e45645e6a43f8dd589f1d3ce1103e83c#diff-868a141c8ba335a462dc768991ee88d95cad873c531d64b10a88385beac311b2R311, renaming `peer_public_key` to `public_key`. I see in the release notes for 42.0.1 that the `sign` function required a similar fix, so I suspect this was overlooked for similar reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT for completeness: the error raised is this one, on the call to `exchange`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   TypeError: ECPrivateKey.exchange() got an unexpected keyword argument 'peer_public_key'\r\n```\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"reaperhulk","id":161495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/161495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk","html_url":"https://github.com/reaperhulk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reaperhulk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pyca/cryptography/issues/10294/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
