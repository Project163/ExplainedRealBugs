Description of the issue\r\n\r\nIn a new server installation (on a VPS provided by OVH) running Ubuntu 18.x the Docker system works flawlessy and fast but docker-compose sometimes hangs indefinitely for no reason. And for every command, from version to ps, up, logs and so on.\r\nI tried everything regarding DNS and name resolution, even disabling systemd-resolved.\r\nWhen it works it is fast. When it hangs I can see the `/tmp/_Mxyz123123` directory created.\r\nRunning with verbose hangs before any output. And then completes flawlessy.\r\n\r\n## Context information (for bug reports)\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose version`**\r\n```\r\ndocker-compose version 1.24.0, build 0aa59064\r\ndocker-py version: 3.7.2\r\nCPython version: 3.6.8\r\nOpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.1.0j  20 Nov 2018\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker version`**\r\n```\r\nClient:\r\n Version:           18.09.5\r\n API version:       1.39\r\n Go version:        go1.10.8\r\n Git commit:        e8ff056\r\n Built:             Thu Apr 11 04:43:57 2019\r\n OS/Arch:           linux/amd64\r\n Experimental:      false\r\n\r\nServer: Docker Engine - Community\r\n Engine:\r\n  Version:          18.09.5\r\n  API version:      1.39 (minimum version 1.12)\r\n  Go version:       go1.10.8\r\n  Git commit:       e8ff056\r\n  Built:            Thu Apr 11 04:10:53 2019\r\n  OS/Arch:          linux/amd64\r\n  Experimental:     false\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker-compose config`**\r\n(Make sure to add the relevant `-f` and other flags)\r\n```\r\n... not related to a specific docker-compose file\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1. docker-compose <command>\r\n\r\n### Observed result\r\n\r\nSometimes hangs\r\n\r\n### Expected result\r\n\r\nRun fast.\r\n\r\n### Stacktrace / full error message\r\n\r\nNo stacktrace but i managed to strace the behavior.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[...]\r\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, \"/tmp/_MEIsYFQ2P/lib/python3.6/config-3.6m-x86_64-linux-gnu/Makefile\", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3</tmp/_MEIsYFQ2P/lib/python3.6/config-3.6m-x86_64-linux-gnu/Makefile> <0.000038>\r\nfstat(3</tmp/_MEIsYFQ2P/lib/python3.6/config-3.6m-x86_64-linux-gnu/Makefile>, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0 <0.000020>\r\nwrite(3</tmp/_MEIsYFQ2P/lib/python3.6/config-3.6m-x86_64-linux-gnu/Makefile>, \"# Generated automatically from M\"..., 69632) = 69632 <0.000130>\r\nfchmod(3</tmp/_MEIsYFQ2P/lib/python3.6/config-3.6m-x86_64-linux-gnu/Makefile>, 0700) = 0 <0.000050>\r\nwrite(3</tmp/_MEIsYFQ2P/lib/python3.6/config-3.6m-x86_64-linux-gnu/Makefile>, \"type.o   -o Modules/xxsubtype$(E\"..., 43) = 43 <0.000029>\r\nclose(3</tmp/_MEIsYFQ2P/lib/python3.6/config-3.6m-x86_64-linux-gnu/Makefile>) = 0 <0.000021>\r\nclone(child_stack=NULL, flags=CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID|CLONE_CHILD_SETTID|SIGCHLD, child_tidptr=0x7f2088645a10) = 3110 <0.000276>\r\nrt_sigaction(SIGINT, {sa_handler=0x404840, sa_mask=[INT], sa_flags=SA_RESTORER|SA_RESTART, sa_restorer=0x7f2087c55f20}, {sa_handler=SIG_DFL, sa_mask=[], sa_flags=0}, 8) = 0 <0.000051>\r\nrt_sigaction(SIGKILL, {sa_handler=0x404840, sa_mask=[KILL], sa_flags=SA_RESTORER|SA_RESTART, sa_restorer=0x7f2087c55f20}, 0x7ffe82f7d900, 8) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument) <0.000031>\r\nrt_sigaction(SIGTERM, {sa_handler=0x404840, sa_mask=[TERM], sa_flags=SA_RESTORER|SA_RESTART, sa_restorer=0x7f2087c55f20}, {sa_handler=SIG_DFL, sa_mask=[], sa_flags=0}, 8) = 0 <0.000028>\r\nwait4(-1, \r\n\r\n[... here it hangs and then after 114s it continues output ...]\r\n\r\nwait4(-1, docker-compose version 1.24.0, build 0aa59064\r\ndocker-py version: 3.7.2\r\nCPython version: 3.6.8\r\nOpenSSL version: OpenSSL 1.1.0j  20 Nov 2018\r\n[{WIFEXITED(s) && WEXITSTATUS(s) == 0}], 0, NULL) = 3110 <114.945565>\r\n--- SIGCHLD {si_signo=SIGCHLD, si_code=CLD_EXITED, si_pid=3110, si_uid=0, si_status=0, si_utime=43, si_stime=6} ---\r\nrt_sigaction(SIGINT, {sa_handler=SIG_DFL, sa_mask=[INT], sa_flags=SA_RESTORER|SA_RESTART, sa_restorer=0x7f2087c55f20}, {sa_handler=0x404840, sa_mask=[INT], sa_flags=SA_RESTORER|SA_RESTART, sa_restorer=0x7f2087c55f20}, 8) = 0 <0.000094>\r\nrt_sigaction(SIGKILL, {sa_handler=SIG_DFL, sa_mask=[KILL], sa_flags=SA_RESTORER|SA_RESTART, sa_restorer=0x7f2087c55f20}, 0x7ffe82f7d900, 8) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument) <0.000150>\r\n\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nLinux vps[omit] 4.15.0-48-generic #51-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 3 08:28:49 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\nUbuntu 18.04.2 LTS\r\n\r\ndocker-compose installed with curl\r\n\r\nI have lot of other docker-compose environments working and this is the first time I see this behavior.
