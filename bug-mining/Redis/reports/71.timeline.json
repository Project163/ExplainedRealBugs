#10552\r\n\r\nWe no longer piggyback getkeys_proc to hold the RedisModuleCommand struct, when exists\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\nUse `doesCommandHaveKeys` in `RM_GetCommandKeysWithFlags` and `getKeysSubcommandImpl`. It causes a very minor behavioral change in commands that don't have actual keys, but have a spec with `CMD_KEY_NOT_KEY`.\r\nFor example, before this command `COMMAND GETKEYS SPUBLISH` would return `Invalid arguments specified for command` but not it returns `The command has no key
