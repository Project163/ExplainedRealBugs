problem/use-case that the feature addresses**\r\n\r\nPutting it simply all use cases that heavily rely on string to floating-point conversion, (e.g. meaning take a string like \"1.5\" and return a 64-bit double-precision floating-point number like 1.5 ), could benefit from a performance boost by swapping `strtod` by the equivalent [`fast_double_parser`](https://github.com/lemire/fast_double_parser), as measured by Daniel Lemire ( @lemire on GH ) on his blog https://lemire.me/blog/2020/03/10/fast-float-parsing-in-practice/ :\r\n\r\n\r\nparser | MB/s\r\n-- | --\r\nfast_double_parser (new) | 660 MB/s\r\nabseil, from_chars | 330 MB/s\r\ndouble_conversion | 250 MB/s\r\nstrtod | 70 MB/s\r\n\r\nThe 99% cases performance improvement and correctness of 100%: Putting it simply, when we cannot use the  Eisel-Lemire algorithm we fall back to the equivalent strtod, meaning this change is 100% compatible.\r\n\r\n**Real application use-case** \r\n\r\nWe've applied the fast_double_parser to a Redis Module ( RedisTimeSeries ) by leveraging a C Wrapper for the C++ Eisel-Lemire ParseFloat algorithm, and noticed a bump in performance on our write workflows of ~=8% on the achievable ops/sec, as detailed here: https://github.com/RedisTimeSeries/RedisTimeSeries/pull/683. For the redis use-case I believe we should not use C++ at all and rely upon solely on a C header-only library ( as described bellow ). \r\n\r\n**Description of the feature**\r\n\r\nLeverage a C Header only library ( based on the C++ one available here: https://github.com/lemire/fast_double_parser/blob/master/include/fast_double_parser.h ) \r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nI would very much like to push this POC forward, meaning I volunteer to make available and test the C header-only lib and apply it to Redis and check the performance improvements  :) \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sundb","id":965798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb","html_url":"https://github.com/sundb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/8825/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/8825/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
