The `redis-cli --scan` output should honor output mode (set explicitly or implicitly), and quote key names when not in raw mode.\r\n  * Technically this is a breaking change, but it should be very minor since raw mode is by default on for non-tty output.\r\n  * It should only affect  TTY output (human users) or non-tty output if `--no-raw` is specified.\r\n\r\n* Added `--quoted-input` option to treat all arguments as potentially quoted strings.\r\n* Added `--quoted-pattern` option to accept a potentially quoted pattern.\r\n\r\nUnquoting is applied to potentially quoted input only if single
