Due to ACL we may now let these clients have restricted access to their own namespaces for stored data, but we can not give them access to pub/sub without giving them the possibility to interfere with eachother. \r\n\r\n**Description of the feature**\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to allow users pub/sub access to only certain channels, similarly to how we restrict access to keys\r\n\r\n**Alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n- Have seperate Redis instances for clients that should communicate\r\n- Allow clients to interfere with eachother\r\n- Use non-redis pub/sub features\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\nI couldn't find any information regarding this feature or whether it has been discussed before","closed_by":{"login":"itamarhaber","id":6059516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk1MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6059516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itamarhaber","html_url":"https://github.com/itamarhaber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itamarhaber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itamarhaber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itamarhaber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itamarhaber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itamarhaber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itamarhaber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itamarhaber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itamarhaber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itamarhaber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/7923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/7923/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
