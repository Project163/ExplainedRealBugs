adding a new ACL rule, an attempt was made to remove any \"overlapping\" rules. However, when a match was found, the search was not resumed at the right location, but instead after the original position of the original command.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the current rules were `-config +config|get` and a rule `+config` was added. It would identify that -config was matched, but it would skip over +config|get, leaving the compacted rule `-config +config`. This would be evaluated safely, but looks weird.\r\n\r\nThis bug can only be triggered with subcommands, since that is the only way to have sequential matching rules. Resolves https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/12470. This is also only present in 7.2. I think there was also a minor risk of removing another valid rule, since it would start the search of the next command at an arbitrary point. I couldn't find a valid offset that would have cause a match using any of the existing commands that have subcommands with another command.
