following usage will output an empty newline:\r\n```\r\n> redis-cli help set\r\nempty line\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that in interactive mode, we have called\r\n`cliInitHelp`, which initializes help.\r\n\r\nWhen using `redis-cli help xxx` or `redis-cli help ? xxx`,\r\nwe can't match the command due to empty `helpEntries`,\r\nso we output an empty newline.\r\n\r\nIn this commit, we will call `cliInitHelp` to init the help.\r\nNote that in this case, we need to call `cliInitHelp` (COMMAND DOCS)\r\nevery time, which i think is acceptable.\r\n\r\nSo now the output will look like:\r\n```\r\n[redis]# src/redis-cli help get\r\n\r\n  GET key\r\n  summary: Get the value of a key\r\n  since: 1.0.0\r\n  group: string\r\n\r\n[redis]#\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #10378\r\n\r\nThis PR also fix a redis-cli crash when using `--ldb --eval`:\r\n```\r\n[root]# src/redis-cli --ldb --eval test.lua test 1\r\nLua debugging session started, please use:\r\nquit    -- End the session.\r\nrestart -- Restart the script in debug mode again.\r\nhelp    -- Show Lua script debugging commands.\r\n\r\n* Stopped at 1, stop reason = step over\r\n-> 1   local num = redis.call('GET', KEYS[1]);\r\nredis-cli: redis-cli.c:718: cliCountCommands: Assertion\r\n`commandTable->element[i]->type == 1' failed.\r\nAborted\r\n```\r\nBecause in ldb mode, `COMMAND DOCS` or `COMMAND` will\r\nreturn an array, only with one element, and the type\r\nis `REDIS_REPLY_STATUS`, the result is `<error> Unknown\r\nRedis Lua debugger command or wrong number of arguments`.\r\n\r\nSo if we are in the ldb mode, and init the Redis HELP, we\r\nwill get the wrong response and crash the redis-cli.\r\nIn ldb mode we don't initialize HELP, help is only initialized\r\nafter the lua debugging session ends.\r\n\r\nIt was broken in
