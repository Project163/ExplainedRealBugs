Start redis with config open `io-threads-do-reads`\r\n\r\n    ./redis-server --io-threads 4 --io-threads-do-reads yes\r\n\r\n2. Process some commands using redis-benchmark\r\n\r\n    ./redis-benchmark -t get,set -n 10000000 -l --threads 6\r\n\r\n3. Send a slow lua script\r\n\r\n    127.0.0.1:6379> eval \"for i=1,100000000,1 do redis.call('get','a') end\" 0\r\n\r\n4. Kill redis-benchmark after Lua slow script detected and before the script done.\r\n\r\n    now redis crashes\r\n\r\nThe root cause is we use function `processEventsWhileBlocked` to handle events if lua timeout, and the read events are delayed and just put client into `server.clients_pending_read`'s head, but `aeProcessEvents` is called without flag `AE_CALL_AFTER_SLEEP` in `processEventsWhileBlocked`, so the new fired read event cannot be processed, since we call `handleClientsWithPendingReadsUsingThreads` in `afterSleep`. And client close connection before lua script done.\r\n\r\nThen after lua script done, function `handleClientsWithPendingReadsUsingThreads` empty the list `server.clients_pending_read` but does not remove the new fired client's `CLIENT_PENDING_READ` flag.\r\n\r\nFinally `freeClient` try to remove the client from `server.clients_pending_read` because it's still with `CLIENT_PENDING_READ` flag but cannot find it, so the assertion failed.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, I don't call `beforeSleep` and `handleClientsWithPendingReadsUsingThreads` in `processEventsWhileBlocked`, because I think in this scenario we do not need the io-threads mode, just handle all events in main thread is OK.\r\n\r\nSo I add a new variable `process_while_blocked` to check, if we are in `processEventsWhileBlocked` do not postpone client read.\r\n\r\nSee commit 606a01df708fa7b5cfc86ffcd2ce9aa805c825f9 in PR #6989\r\n\r\nThere are also other scenarios too, like `DEBUG RELOAD|LOADAOF` or reboot or slave loading data.","closed_by":{"login":"antirez","id":65632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez","html_url":"https://github.com/antirez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/antirez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/6988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/6988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
