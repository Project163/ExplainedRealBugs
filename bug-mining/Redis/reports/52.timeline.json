am not sure if this is a bug or expected behaviour so I am raising this as a question.\r\n\r\nI have redis deployed in a 3 node cluster, with each node containing redis-server and redis-sentinel on their default ports. The configuration management is all automated and the services are deployed with a base config.\r\n\r\nRecently we have been having issues with failover, where despite the fact that 1 node in the cluster is offline the sentinels will refuse to elect a new master and continue to postpone the election. After drilling down into the issue I can see that this is caused by duplicate entries for known-sentinels appearing in the sentinel config:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsentinel known-sentinel mymaster 192.168.1.13 0 e66d389b62a4ad7c128401e20e6f0f1af1b74019\r\nsentinel known-sentinel mymaster 192.168.1.13 26379 23aa168d0724813338a3179ebad83fb6e11b3eda\r\n```\r\nThose entries refer to the same sentinel, which had its config reset/changed by the config management system(wiping its id). When it comes back the other sentinels make a new entry for it but keep the old one too changing the port.\r\n\r\nI understand that sentinels will not remove any already discovered members when they go offline to preserve the topology: https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/1972. However this case is slightly different as the same sentinel (same port and ip) rejoins the cluster. Is there a reason why this entry is not replaced/edited instead of adding an entirely new line?\r\n\r\nIf there is a reason is this behaviour documented anywhere? I cant find a reference to this in the official sentinel docs (https://redis.io/topics/sentinel). I imagine other people would run afoul of this issue if the sentinels are deployed with a default/minimal configuration (https://bugs.launchpad.net/kolla-ansible/+bug/1788179).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/8791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/8791/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/820589114","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/8786#issuecomment-820589114","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/8786","id":820589114,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMDU4OTExNA==","user":{"login":"brokoli18","id":23342965,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzQyOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23342965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brokoli18","html_url":"https://github.com/brokoli18","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brokoli18/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brokoli18/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brokoli18/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brokoli18/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brokoli18/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brokoli18/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brokoli18/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brokoli18/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brokoli18/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-15T17:06:00Z","updated_at":"2021-04-15T17:06:13Z","body":"I

is a bug that is mentioned in issue 8786 https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/8786. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that when a sentinel with the same address and IP is turned on with a different runid, its port is set to 0 but it is still present in the dictionary master->sentinels which contain all the sentinels for a master. This causes a problem when we do INFO SENTINEL because it takes the size of the dictionary of sentinels. This might also cause a problem for failover if enough sentinels have their port set to 0 since the number of voters in failover is also determined by the size of the dictionary of sentinels.\r\n\r\nWe suggest that we should remove the sentinels with the port set to zero from the dictionary of sentinels.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/9240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/9240/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5084929004,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTA4NDkyOTAwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/5084929004","actor":{"login":"yossigo","id":1481195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODExOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1481195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo","html_url":"https://github.com/yossigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"db4153645458bbc23c0394a8974b734825a656e5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/commits/db4153645458bbc23c0394a8974b734825a656e5","created_at":"2021-07-29T09:32:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5269501720,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAJhcs4zJJAUzwAAAAE6FjcY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/5269501720","actor":{"login":"JackieXie168","id":8347113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDcxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8347113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieXie168","html_url":"https://github.com/JackieXie168","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieXie168/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieXie168/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieXie168/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieXie168/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieXie168/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieXie168/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieXie168/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieXie168/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JackieXie168/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"afd20520c6061f148af3aa1a870084d9375974cc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JackieXie168/redis/commits/afd20520c6061f148af3aa1a870084d9375974cc","created_at":"2021-09-08T04:10:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
