I recently implemented something in my company that had the exact same requirement: \"subscribe\" (starting a loop of XREAD) and get the last element at the same time. I solved by just calling XREVRANGE before to get the last element, didn't even think about the possibility of changing XREAD, but looking through the issues for the next milestone here, I saw this issue and got interested because of the practical application for my case.\r\n\r\nBut I'll take a look at the issue you mentioned! Thanks for the
