If it failed in setsockopt at line 471, it will close the socket and goto label error at line 513 without change socket to -1. Suppose that we do not support IPV6 Protocol, and we create a socket, then it will be closed. And at the \"error\" label, it will be closed twice and return a errno EBADF, which will cause failure to create any tcp server.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Use lwip (https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lwip.git, version 2.1.2 released) as the Internet support.\r\n2. Set LWIP_IPV6 macro to 0\r\n3. Compile the redis and run redis-server\r\n4. We can observe that redis cannot create any http server.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe socket should be set to -1 to avoid double close.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\nIt can simply resolved by adding \"s = -1\" in the conditional branch at line 504.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"yossigo","id":1481195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODExOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1481195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo","html_url":"https://github.com/yossigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/8165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/8165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
