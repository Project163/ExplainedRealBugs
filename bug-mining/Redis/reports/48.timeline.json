We should probably just add an arbitrary number of endpoints per node so we can advertise everything we know - i.e. multiple ports with/without TLS, multiple addresses, etc.\r\n\r\n@madolson I think you raised the hostname issue in the past, any other thoughts here?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/738294765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yossigo","id":1481195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODExOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1481195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo","html_url":"https://github.com/yossigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4069609961,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDA2OTYwOTk2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/4069609961","actor":{"login":"zuiderkwast","id":273886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Mzg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/273886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast","html_url":"https://github.com/zuiderkwast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-03T20:41:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4069609963,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwNjk2MDk5NjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/4069609963","actor":{"login":"zuiderkwast","id":273886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Mzg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/273886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast","html_url":"https://github.com/zuiderkwast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-03T20:41:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4069609970,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDA2OTYwOTk3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/4069609970","actor":{"login":"madolson","id":34459052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NDU5MDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34459052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madolson","html_url":"https://github.com/madolson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madolson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madolson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madolson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madolson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madolson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madolson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madolson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madolson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madolson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-03T20:41:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4069609974,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwNjk2MDk5NzQ=","url":"https://api.githu
