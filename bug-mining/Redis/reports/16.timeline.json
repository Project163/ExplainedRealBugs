Hello, sorry I was traveling, back at home finally. Yes I would love if you could alter PR and doc if possible, because I think that it is sensible if we increment the count every time we *deliver* the message.

`xreadgroup` request for that one `ID`, or;\r\n2) Use `xpending` to view last tries counter value, and follow it with `xclaim` `RETRYCOUNT` setting it to +1 what you last saw, manually (not thread-safe, so be certain only one client is attempting this)\r\n3) If recovering your own consumer id messages post-crash, `xreadgroup` with `COUNT 1` and `ID` of `0` gives your oldest pending message while incrementing tries and resetting lastReadAgo, and then `xpending` for that specific `ID` will tell you what those values are.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/517534906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ancms2600","id":33462385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDYyMzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33462385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancms2600","html_url":"https://github.com/ancms2600","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancms2600/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancms2600/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancms2600/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancms2600/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancms2600/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancms2600/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancms2600/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancms2600/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ancms2600/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
