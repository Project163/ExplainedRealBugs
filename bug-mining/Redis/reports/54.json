problem**\r\n\r\nReading the documentation:\r\n\r\nhttps://redis.io/commands/command#movable-keys\r\nhttps://redis.io/commands/command-getkeys\r\n\r\nThere is no way today to cache key indexes for commands such as ZUNIONSTORE/EVAL others with \"numkeys\", since COMMAND INFO returns 0 info for them.\r\n\r\nThis requires to 'patch' the code for those commands, or to disable caching and resolve each such command's keys with COMMAND GETKEYS if you are planning on a cluster aware redis client.\r\n\r\n**The solution**\r\n\r\nAll commands that have \"numkeys\" indexing (most / all of movable keys), should instead of this output:\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> command info eval\r\n1) 1) \"eval\"\r\n   2) (integer) -3\r\n   3) 1) noscript\r\n      2) movablekeys\r\n   4) (integer) 0\r\n   5) (integer) 0\r\n   6) (integer) 0\r\n   7) 1) @slow\r\n      2) @scripting\r\n```\r\n\r\nProduce this output:\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> command info eval\r\n1) 1) \"eval\"\r\n   2) (integer) -3\r\n   3) 1) noscript\r\n      2) movablekeys\r\n   4) (integer) 3\r\n   5) (integer) -2\r\n   6) (integer) 1\r\n   7) 1) @slow\r\n      2) @scripting\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main change here is that argument #5 (Last key in argument list) meaning under \"movablekeys\" is different:\r\n\r\nhttps://redis.io/commands/command#last-key-in-argument-list\r\n\r\nIt's negative so that people who ignore reading the documentation, will not use it by accident, and it absolute value points to index which holds the numkeys.\r\n\r\nAlso it's non-conflicting with -1 meaning in the regular case, because numkeys means it's not infinite number of keys, just that index 1 holds how many keys there are.\r\n\r\nThis will make the clients be able to cache this information for cluster key usage.\r\n\r\nOfcourse a breaking change (such as ACL did) to the output can just add another variable that means (-1 no such numkeys index, or <number> for the numkeys index) instead.","closed_by":{"login":"oranagra","id":7045099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDUwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7045099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra","html_url":"https://github.com/oranagra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/7297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/7297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
