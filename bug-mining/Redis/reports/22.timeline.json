enable diskless replication by default\r\n2. add a new config named repl-diskless-sync-max-replicas that enables\r\n   replication to start before the full repl-diskless-sync-delay was\r\n   reached.\r\n3. put replica online sooner on the master (see below)\r\n4. test suite uses repl-diskless-sync-delay of 0 to be faster\r\n5. a few tests that use multiple replica on a pre-populated master, are\r\n   now using the new repl-diskless-sync-max-replicas\r\n6. fix possible timing issues in a few cluster tests (see below)\r\n\r\nput replica online sooner on the master \r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nthere were two tests that failed because they needed for the master to\r\nrealize that the replica is online, but the test code was actually only\r\nwaiting for the replica to realize it's online, and in diskless it could\r\nhave been before the master realized it.\r\n\r\nchanges include two things:\r\n1. the tests wait on the right thing\r\n2. issues in the master, putting the replica online in two steps.\r\n\r\nthe master used to put the replica as online in 2 steps. the first\r\nstep was to mark it as online, and the second step was to enable the\r\nwrite event (only after getting ACK), but in fact the first step didn't\r\ncontains some of the tasks to put it online (like updating good slave\r\ncount, and sending the module event). this meant that if a test was\r\nwaiting to see that the replica is online form the point of view of the\r\nmaster, and then confirm that the module got an event, or that the\r\nmaster has enough good replicas, it could fail due to timing issues.\r\n\r\nso now the full effect of putting the replica online, happens at once,\r\nand only the part about enabling the writes is delayed till the ACK.\r\n\r\nfix cluster tests \r\n--------------------\r\nI added some code to wait for the replica to sync and avoid race\r\nconditions.\r\nlater realized the sentinel and cluster tests where using the original 5\r\nseconds delay, so changed it to 0.\r\n\r\nthis means the other changes are probably not needed, but i suppose\r\nthey're still better (avoid race conditions)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/10092/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/10092/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/1012147522","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/5256#issuecomment-1012147522","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/5256","id":1012147522,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJhcs48VCVC","user":{"login":"enjoy-binbin","id":22811481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODExNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22811481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin","html_url":"https://github.com/enjoy-binbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-13T13:42:00Z","updated_at":"2022-01-13T13:42:00Z","body":"fixed
