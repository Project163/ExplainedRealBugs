Just rewrite the whole `INCRBYFLOAT` cmd as `SETEX key value expiretime` and change `cmd->proc` to `SETEX`, but I don't think this is an elegent solution;\r\nb. Add a new cmd named `UPDATE` or sth else which just updates the value and DO NOT remove the expire time. Then `INCRBYFLOAT` can be rewritten as this cmd. As I known, lots of users need a cmd like `UPDATE` because they just wanna set value and leave the expire time alone;\r\nc. Like the privious one, we can also extend `SET` to `SETUX` or anything else only to update the value.","closed_by":{"login":"enjoy-binbin","id":22811481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODExNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22811481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin","html_url":"https://github.com/enjoy-binbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/5256/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/5256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
