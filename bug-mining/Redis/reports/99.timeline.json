It does make it less likely to end up without a primary, but it doesn't fully eliminate this problem and it might have new implications that I feel hard to reason about. Also, the other state of having two primaries (\"NodeA: master, 0-100;NodeB: master, 0-0\") isn't consistent either but it just happens to be the case that this inconsistency is \"harmless\", an implementation coincidence IMO.\r\n\r\nThe issue at the core is that the observer nodes are seeing intermediate states within a supposedly atomic/isolated transaction (of `A` taking over `B`'s primary-ship). This is equivalent to the money-transfer case where the two operations, both withdraw and deposit, need to be done in an ACID transaction to have an externally consistent sum view throughout the entire transaction. \r\n\r\nFor a more deterministic solution within the current cluster design, we might want to consider the primary node information in the cluster message header. More specifically, in the second case above, `B`'s `PONG` message to `C` (\"PONG, i'm replica\") should also claim `A` is its primary now (`clusterMsg->slaveOf`). Additionally, `B`'s config epoch should be bumped to `A`'s too. Therefore, `C` should in theory have all the information needed to deduce that `B` has lost its primary-ship to `A`. However, what is not known at this stage is whether `A` still owns the same set of slots as `B`. Imagine a case where the shard, to which both `A` and `B` belong, is going through some slot migration operation, while at the same time a manual failover is triggered. The current cluster implementation doesn't guarantee that the two nodes, `A` and `B`, will have a consistent view on the slot ranges, and this is because, with cluster V1, we are not going through consensus when finalizing the slot ownership transfer and the slot ownership transfer is not \"highly-available\" even if a replica exists. My PR #10517 should help with the second issue but it won't address the consensus-less part. That said, I still think this is a more permanent solution than delaying.\r\n\r\nOf course, the real solution would be to enforce strong consistency on any topology changes, which is one of the core attributes of cluster V2.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/1925965354/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PingXie","id":11568491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY4NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11568491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingXie","html_url":"https://github.com/PingXie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingXie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingXie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingXie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingXie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingXie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingXie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingXie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingXie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PingXie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/1931602518","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/13018#issuecomment-1931602518","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/13018","id":1931602518,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJhcs5zIepW","user":{"login":"zuiderkwast","id":273886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Mzg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/273886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast","html_url":"https://github.com/zuiderkwast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-07T09:15:45Z","updated_at":"2024-02-07T09:15:45Z","body":"@PingXie Are you saying #10517 solves the same problem?
