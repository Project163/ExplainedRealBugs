background\r\nTill now CONFIG SET was blocked during loading.\r\n(In the not so distant past, GET was disallowed too)\r\n\r\nWe recently (not released yet) added an async-loading mode, see #9323, and during that time it'll serve CONFIG SET and any other command.\r\nAnd now we realized (#9770) that some configs, and commands are dangerous during async-loading.\r\n\r\n## changes\r\n* Allow most CONFIG SET during loading (both on async-loading and normal loading)\r\n* Allow CONFIG REWRITE and CONFIG RESETSTAT during loading\r\n* Block a few config during loading (`appendonly`, `repl-diskless-load`, and `dir`)\r\n* Block a few commands during loading (list below)\r\n\r\n## the blocked commands:\r\n* SAVE - obviously we don't wanna start a foregreound save during loading 8-)\r\n* BGSAVE - we don't mind to schedule one, but we don't wanna fork now\r\n* BGREWRITEAOF - we don't mind to schedule one, but we don't wanna fork now\r\n* MODULE - we obviously don't wanna unload a module during replication / rdb loading (MODULE HELP and MODULE LIST are not blocked)\r\n* SYNC / PSYNC - we're in the middle of RDB loading from master, must not allow sync requests now.\r\n* REPLICAOF / SLAVEOF - we're in the middle of replicating, maybe it makes sense to let the user abort it, but he couldn't do that so far, i don't wanna take any risk of bugs due to odd state.\r\n* CLUSTER - only allow [HELP, SLOTS, NODES, INFO, MYID, LINKS, KEYSLOT, COUNTKEYSINSLOT, GETKEYSINSLOT, RESET, REPLICAS, COUNT_FAILURE_REPORTS], for others, preserve the status quo\r\n\r\n## other fixes\r\n* processEventsWhileBlocked had an issue when being nested, this could happen with a busy script during async loading (new), but also in a busy script during AOF loading (old). this lead to a crash in the scenario described in #6988\r\n\r\n## todo\r\n- [x] convert the hard coded list of commands to block to command flags\r\n- [x] remove SENTINEL (it's not allowed in loading anyway)\r\n- [x] make sure to add the flag to both SLAVEOF and REPLICAOF\r\n- [x] block most CLUSTER sub-commands, only allow the ones listed
