It is important for modules to be able to add entries to the INFO output, so that standard monitoring systems would be able to monitor them too.\r\n- Modules should not emit that formatted string directly, so that the API doesn't need to be changed when a future INFO command is changed to include a more semantic format.\r\n- Modules should not be included in the default `INFO` or `INFO all` for fear of causing latency for some systems that just want to get info about replication or memory\r\n- Modules full info should be included in the crash report, but possibly printed after other important information is already emitted to the log, so that a crash in fetching the module info will not leave us completely in the dark.\r\n- All module info fields should be properly prefixed, and not include invalid chars (`:` and '\\r\\n')\r\n- We want to let each module fill multiple sections if it wishes to.\r\n- In the future we may want INFO command to be able to get a list of requested sections from the user.\r\n\r\nAPI:\r\n```\r\n/* Request to provide info.\r\n * The module should respond by calling RedisModule_AddInfoSection and\r\n * RedisModule_AddInfoField* multiple times.\r\n * The module should avoid calculations that can induce latency.\r\n */\r\ntypedef int (*RedisModuleInfoFunc)(RedisModuleInfoCtx *ctx, int for_crash_report);\r\n\r\n/* Used to start a new section,

skipped. */\r\nint RedisModule_AddInfoSection(RedisModuleInfoCtx *ctx, RedisModuleString *name);\r\n\r\n/* Used by RedisModuleInfoFunc to add info fields.\r\n * Each field will be automatically

RedisModuleInfoFunc cb);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBehavior:\r\n- `INFO` - the default info will not include any info about modules.\r\n- `INFO all` - will only include the list of loaded modules and versions (#6024)\r\n- `INFO modules` - will include the list of loaded modules, as well as all the sections modules want to add (calling RedisModuleInfoFunc with argc=0)\r\n- `INFO everything` - same as `INFO all` and `INFO modules`\r\n- `INFO <module_name> - will emit all the sections of a specific module\r\n- `info <section>` - if the specific section requested was not found in redis section list, RedisModuleInfoFunc will be called for all the modules (hoping that one will fill it)\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n- do we want to provide a user_data argument to the callback?\r\n- do we want to support dict fields (like the ones in INFO KEYSPACE)?\r\n- how do we format double fields?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/514218289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"oranagra","id":7045099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDUwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7045099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra","html_url":"https://github.com/oranagra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/514218893","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/6012#issuecomment-514218893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/6012","id":514218893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDIxODg5Mw==","user":{"login":"oranagra","id":7045099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDUwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7045099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra","html_url":"https://github.com/oranagra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-23T13:51:10Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T13:51:10Z","body":"@antirez
