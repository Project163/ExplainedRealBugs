except it behaves a little strangely in an interactive redis-cli session:\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> SET s REDIS\r\nOK\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> GETRANGE s 0 -500\r\n\"\"\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> GETRANGE s 0

quite understand why this is happening yet.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/1578610404/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"slavak","id":1161160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjExNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1161160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavak","html_url":"https://github.com/slavak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slavak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"linzihao1999","id":20656786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjU2Nzg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20656786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linzihao1999","html_url":"https://github.com/linzihao1999","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linzihao1999/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linzihao1999/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linzihao1999/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linzihao1999/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linzihao1999/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linzihao1999/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linzihao1999/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linzihao1999/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linzihao1999/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-06T15:13:42Z","updated_at":"2023-06-06T15:13:42Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/12272","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/12272/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/12272/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/12272/events","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/12272","id":1744080504,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAAJhcs5SUTp7","number":12272,"title":"Improve
