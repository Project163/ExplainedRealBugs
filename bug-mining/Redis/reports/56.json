the bug**\r\nThis test may fail on external server. \r\nIt succeeds normaly, but fails occasionally on my environment with some arbitrary network deny.\r\n```\r\n    test \"BLMPOP with multiple blocked clients\" {\r\n        set rd1 [redis_deferring_client]\r\n        set rd2 [redis_deferring_client]\r\n        set rd3 [redis_deferring_client]\r\n        set rd4 [redis_deferring_client]\r\n        r del blist{t} blist2{t}\r\n\r\n        $rd1 blmpop 0 2 blist{t} blist2{t} left count 1\r\n        $rd2 blmpop 0 2 blist{t} blist2{t} right count 10\r\n        $rd3 blmpop 0 2 blist{t} blist2{t} left count 10\r\n        $rd4 blmpop 0 2 blist{t} blist2{t} right count 1\r\n        wait_for_blocked_clients_count 4\r\n\r\n        r multi\r\n        r lpush blist{t} a b c d e\r\n        r lpush blist2{t} 1 2 3 4 5\r\n        r exec\r\n\r\n        assert_equal {blist{t} e} [$rd1 read]\r\n        assert_equal {blist{t} {a b c d}} [$rd2 read]\r\n        assert_equal {blist2{t} {5 4 3 2 1}} [$rd3 read]\r\n\r\n        r lpush blist2{t} 1 2 3\r\n        assert_equal {blist2{t} 1} [$rd4 read]\r\n        $rd1 close\r\n        $rd2 close\r\n        $rd3 close\r\n        $rd4 close\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nI guess it may depend on the order of sending the four `blmpop` commands.\r\nJust changing the sending order like this to simulate the disordered arrival due to network deny, it  almost always fails.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        $rd4 blmpop 0 2 blist{t} blist2{t} right count 1\r\n        $rd1 blmpop 0 2 blist{t} blist2{t} left count 1\r\n        $rd2 blmpop 0 2 blist{t} blist2{t} right count 10\r\n        $rd3 blmpop 0 2 blist{t} blist2{t} left count 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThis test may not depend on the sending order or be removed out of external server tests because the unreliable network condition.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"oranagra","id":7045099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDUwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7045099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra","html_url":"https://github.com/oranagra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/9850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/9850/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
