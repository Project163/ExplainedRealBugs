info fields should have a key-value pair separated by `:`.\r\nbut in some cases the command stats and error stats can cause the \"key\" part to have `:` or `@`.\r\nthe `@user_script:` error looks like a bug too (exists sine v2.8), not sure what was the meaning.\r\n```\r\n127.0.0.1:6379> eval \"return redis.call('brpop', 'k', 1)\" 0\r\n(error) ERR Error running script (call to

a `:` at the end of have a special handling for `c->proc == securityWarningCommand`, or simple have some utility function that translates anything not in the range of `A-Z, a-z, 0.9` with `_`.","closed_by":{"login":"yossigo","id":1481195,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODExOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1481195?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo","html_url":"https://github.com/yossigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yossigo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/8489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/8489/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
