And then I tried to use `SET` or other commands (may be `LRANGE`) to get some data from the `redis-server`, but I got the unexpected response.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n`Environment:` \r\n* redis-server: Redis server v=7.0.3 sha=00000000:0 malloc=jemalloc-5.2.1 bits=64 build=9e1e27bf47eab674\r\n* redis-cli: redis-cli 7.0.3\r\n* OS: Ubuntu 16.04\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior and/or a minimal code sample.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28601090/181213225-a0487fd1-cade-4889-bd62-db6c87e79c46.png)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI think the `GET a` command should return `100` right after I use `UNSUBSCRIBE ch1 ch2`, rather than the response from `UNSUBSCRIBE` command.","closed_by":{"login":"oranagra","id":7045099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDUwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7045099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra","html_url":"https://github.com/oranagra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/11046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/11046/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
