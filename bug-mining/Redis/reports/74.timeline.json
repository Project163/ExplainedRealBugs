SET and BITFIELD command were added `get_keys_function` in #10148, causing\r\nthem to be wrongly marked movablekeys in `populateCommandMovableKeys`.\r\n\r\nThis was an unintended side effect introduced in #10148 (7.0 RC1)\r\nwhich could cause some clients an extra round trip for these commands in cluster mode.\r\n\r\nSince we define movablekeys as a way to determine if the legacy range [first, last, step]\r\ndoesn't find all keys, then we need a completely different approach.\r\n\r\nThe right approach should be to check if the legacy range covers all key-specs,\r\nand if none of the key-specs have the INCOMPLETE flag. \r\nThis way, we don't need to look at getkeys_proc of VARIABLE_FLAG at all.\r\nProbably with the exception of modules, who may still not be using key-specs.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we removed `populateCommandMovableKeys` and put its logic in\r\n`populateCommandLegacyRangeSpec`.\r\nIn order to properly serve both old and new modules, we must probably keep relying\r\nCMD_MODULE_GETKEYS, but do that only for modules that don't declare key-specs. \r\nFor ones that do, we need to take the same approach we take with native redis commands.\r\n\r\nThis approach was proposed by Oran.

\r\nredis-py 4.3.3\r\nredis 7.0.2\r\n\r\n**Platform**: \r\nPython 3.10 / Any plaftorm\r\n\r\n**Description**: \r\nFor now, redis-py lib execute `COMMAND GETKEYS` for any command with **movablekeys** flag every time this command called(implemented in  `commands.parser.CommandsParser`).\r\nAccording to [this](https://redis.io/commands/command/#movablekeys) topic:\r\n\r\n\"As of Redis 7.0, clients can use the [key specifications](https://redis.io/commands/command/#key-specifications) to identify the positions of key names. The only commands that require using [COMMAND GETKEYS](https://redis.io/commands/command-getkeys) are [SORT](https://redis.io/commands/sort) and [MIGRATE](https://redis.io/commands/migrate) for clients that parse keys' specifications.\"\r\n\r\nWhy this implementation important: one of command with **movablekeys** flag is `SET`, which seams one of the most \"popular\" command in pair with `GET`.  So, for now, call `SET ` always means to do additional call `COMMAND GETKEYS SET` which defenetly increase summary latency.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis-py/issues/2229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis-py/issues/2229/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8982294387,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAJhcs5LYxF1zwAAAAIXYu9z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/8982294387","actor":{"login":"Mixficsol","id":73943232,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTQzMjMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73943232?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mixficsol","html_url":"https://github.com/Mixficsol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mixficsol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mixficsol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mixficsol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mixficsol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mixficsol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mixficsol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mixficsol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mixficsol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mixficsol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c8eca6754fb7940d62d125cac4e63c8e4215428a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Mixficsol/redis/commits/c8eca6754fb7940d62d125cac4e63c8e4215428a","created_at":"2023-04-12T07:35:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9966088213,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAJhcs5LYxF1zwAAAAJSBnAV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/9966088213","actor":{"login":"enjoy-binbin","id":22811481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODExNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22811481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin","html_url":"https://github.com/enjoy-binbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"12d114bc4414826ab145ffd64d82c37af0ec9bec","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enjoy-binbin/redis/commits/12d114bc4414826ab145ffd64d82c37af0ec9bec","created_at":"2023-07-31T16:15:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
