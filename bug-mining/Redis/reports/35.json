XALT is a framework, mostly used on HPC systems, to gather statistics on software usage. It is activated by using `LD_PRELOAD` of a small XALT library that saves statistics on processes being run. What happens is that `redis-server` segfaults when the `LD_PRELOAD` is active:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(gdb) bt\r\n#0  0x00002aaaab996d04 in __strchr_sse42 () from /lib64/libc.so.6\r\n#1  0x00000000004b8c28 in spt_copyenv (oldenv=0x819ca0) at setproctitle.c:115\r\n#2  0x00000000004b8fb0 in spt_init (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffff5a88) at setproctitle.c:198\r\n#3  0x0000000000443404 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffff5a88) at server.c:5168\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe're pretty sure this is a bug (or dependence on undefined behaviour) in Redis. Looking at the environment related code in `setproctitle.c`, especially `spt_copyenv()`, looks fishy. The environment is cleared using `clearenv()` (through `spt_clearenv()` in this case) but a pointer to the original `environ` is saved as `oldenv`. The old entries in `oldenv` are then processed and copied to the new environment with `setenv()`. But the latter calls will update entries in `environ`. What is unclear to me is what guarantees `clearenv()` gives about the content of `environ` after it is called. It might simply set `environ` to NULL, but still use the same memory for `setenv()` calls that follow, this is not clear. As `oldenv` still points to the old `environ` content it might depend on undefined behaviour normally, but that behaviour changes when running under XALT.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/xalt/xalt/issues/41 for more details. Unfortunately, building and configuring XALT is a bit too extensive to add here.\r\n\r\n```\r\npaulm@tcn180 17:19 ~/c$ tar xf ~/dl/redis-6.0.9.tar.gz \r\npaulm@tcn180 17:19 ~/c$ cd redis-6.0.9/\r\npaulm@tcn180 17:19 ~/c/redis-6.0.9$ make -j32 noopt\r\ncd src && make noopt\r\nmake[1]: Entering directory `/nfs/home4/paulm/c/redis-6.0.9/src'\r\n    CC Makefile.dep\r\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/nfs/home4/paulm/c/redis-6.0.9/src'\r\n...\r\nmake[2]: Leaving directory `/nfs/home4/paulm/c/redis-6.0.9/src'\r\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/nfs/home4/paulm/c/redis-6.0.9/src'\r\n\r\n# Not running under XALT, all OK\r\npaulm@tcn180 17:20 ~/c/redis-6.0.9$ src/redis-server\r\n29208:C 16 Nov 2020 17:20:50.532 # oO0OoO0OoO0Oo Redis is starting oO0OoO0OoO0Oo\r\n29208:C 16 Nov 2020 17:20:50.532 # Redis version=6.0.9, bits=64, commit=00000000, modified=0, pid=29208, just started\r\n29208:C 16 Nov 2020 17:20:50.532 # Warning: no config file specified, using the default config.
