#10439. see https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/9872\r\nWhen executing SHUTDOWN we pause the client so we can un-pause it if the shutdown fails.\r\nthis could happen during the timeout, if the shutdown is aborted, but could also happen from withing the initial `call()` to shutdown, if the rdb save fails.\r\nin that case when we return to `call()`, we'll crash if `c->cmd` has been set to NULL.\r\n\r\nThe call stack is:\r\n```\r\nunblockClient(c)\r\nreplyToClientsBlockedOnShutdown()\r\ncancelShutdown()\r\nfinishShutdown()\r\nprepareForShutdown()\r\nshutdownCommand()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhat's special about SHUTDOWN in that respect is that it can be paused, and then un-paused before the original `call()` returns.\r\ntests where added for both failed shutdown, and a followup successful one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/10440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/10440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6271138416,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAJhcs5F7cPYzwAAAAF1yfpw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/6271138416","actor":{"login":"oranagra","id":7045099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDUwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7045099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra","html_url":"https://github.com/oranagra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-20T13:18:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6271138641,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAJhcs5F7cPYzwAAAAF1yftR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/6271138641","actor":{"login":"oranagra","id":7045099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDUwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7045099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra","html_url":"https://github.com/oranagra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fae5b1a19d0972c2f4274004f15be3d2f90c856c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/commits/fae5b1a19d0972c2f4274004f15be3d2f90c856c","created_at":"2022-03-20T13:19:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
