As a consequence the logged error will be whatever `errno` was set to prior to the call.\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Set `errno = EAGAIN`.\r\n2. Make sure `rdbSaveInternal` is called with arguments that makes `reclaimFilePageCache` fail.\r\n3. Watch the log. It will say: `Unable to reclaim cache after saving RDB: Resource temporarily unavailable` which is not the reason why the internal `posix_fadvise` failed.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI'm expecting the `serverLog(LL_NOTICE,\"Unable to reclaim cache after saving RDB: %s\", strerror(errno));` line to print the real cause for the failure.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\n`posix_*` functions don't set `errno` but return the error instead. If memory serves me right, it's because these functions came into existence before C11 (where `errno` was made `_Thread_local`) so setting and checking `errno` from different threads wasn't thread safe.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sundb","id":965798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NTc5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/965798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb","html_url":"https://github.com/sundb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sundb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/13245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/13245/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
