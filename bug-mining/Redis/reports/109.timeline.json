PR optimizes the performance of HyperLogLog commands (PFCOUNT, PFMERGE) by adding AVX2 fast paths.\r\n\r\nTwo AVX2 functions are added for conversion between raw representation and dense representation. They are 15 ~ 30 times faster than scalar implementaion. Note that sparse representation is not accelerated.\r\n\r\nAVX2 fast paths are enabled when the CPU supports AVX2 (checked at runtime) and the hyperloglog configuration is default (HLL_REGISTERS == 16384 && HLL_BITS == 6).\r\n\r\nWhen merging 3 dense hll structures, the benchmark shows a 12x speedup compared to the scalar version.\r\n\r\n```\r\npfcount key1 key2 key3\r\npfmerge keyall key1 key2 key3\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n======================================================================================================\r\nType             Ops/sec    Avg.
