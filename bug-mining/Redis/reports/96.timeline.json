Is this actually dead code?\r\n\r\nThank you for your response and for acknowledging the possibility of a typo.\r\n\r\nRegarding your point about the socket always being writable after a successful connect, my understanding and tests suggest that while this is often the case, it may not always hold true under certain conditions, such as when connecting to a non-existent external IP address. In my testing, I found that setting connect to non-blocking mode and specifying a short timeout could result in a failure due to timeout, in which case the socket would not become writable.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, in the connSocketBlockingConnect function, when the aeWait call returns 0 (indicating a timeout), the current implementation does not immediately return C_ERR, but continues execution, potentially leading to inconsistent connection states. In my local tests, I observed different error handling behaviors depending on whether the function returns C_ERR or not after aeWait reports a timeout error.\r\n\r\nBased on these observations, I believe that modifying this part to ensure the correct return of C_ERR in case of timeouts and other errors would be meaningful. This would help ensure the function behaves as expected and can properly handle timeouts and other potential connection errors.\r\n\r\nAs for reliably testing this scenario, it indeed poses a challenge as it requires simulating specific network behaviors, like connecting to a non-existent address or simulating a timeout. However, I think it should be possible to construct such test scenarios by setting up specific network conditions or using network simulation tools.\r\n\r\nIf you think it's appropriate, I can open a PR to address this issue.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/1878842729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ganyyy","id":26517484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTE3NDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26517484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganyyy","html_url":"https://github.com/ganyyy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganyyy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganyyy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganyyy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganyyy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganyyy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganyyy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganyyy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganyyy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ganyyy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/comments/1879882916","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/redis/issues/12900#issuecomment-1879882916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/12900","id":1879882916,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAJhcs5wDLyk","user":{"login":"zuiderkwast","id":273886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Mzg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/273886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast","html_url":"https://github.com/zuiderkwast","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zuiderkwast/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-06T23:57:32Z","updated_at":"2024-01-06T23:57:32Z","body":"Good.
