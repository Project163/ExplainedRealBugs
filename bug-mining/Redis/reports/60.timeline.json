Intro\r\n\r\nThe purpose is to allow having different flags/ACL categories for\r\nsubcommands (Example: CONFIG GET is ok-loading but CONFIG SET isn't)\r\n\r\nWe create a small command table for every command that has subcommands\r\nand each subcommand has its own flags, etc. (same as a \"regular\" command)\r\n\r\nThis commit also unites the Redis and the Sentinel command tables\r\n\r\n## Affected commands\r\n\r\nCONFIG\r\nUsed to have \"admin ok-loading ok-stale no-script\"\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Dropped \"ok-loading\" in all except GET (this doesn't change behavior since there were checks in the code doing that)\r\n\r\nXINFO\r\nUsed to have \"read-only random\"\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Dropped \"random\" in all except CONSUMERS\r\n\r\nXGROUP\r\nUsed to have \"write use-memory\"\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Dropped \"use-memory\" in all except CREATE and CREATECONSUMER\r\n\r\nCOMMAND\r\nNo changes.\r\n\r\nMEMORY\r\nUsed to have \"random read-only\"\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Dropped \"random\" in PURGE and USAGE\r\n\r\nACL\r\nUsed to have \"admin no-script ok-loading ok-stale\"\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Dropped \"admin\" in WHOAMI, GENPASS, and CAT\r\n\r\nLATENCY\r\nNo changes.\r\n\r\nMODULE\r\nNo changes.\r\n\r\nSLOWLOG\r\nUsed to have \"admin random ok-loading ok-stale\"\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Dropped \"random\" in RESET\r\n\r\nOBJECT\r\nUsed to have \"read-only random\"\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Dropped \"random\" in ENCODING and REFCOUNT\r\n\r\nSCRIPT\r\nUsed to have \"may-replicate no-script\"\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Dropped \"may-replicate\" in all except FLUSH and LOAD\r\n\r\nCLIENT\r\nUsed to have \"admin no-script random ok-loading ok-stale\"\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Dropped \"random\" in all except INFO and LIST\r\n2. Dropped \"admin\" in ID, TRACKING, TRACKINGINFO, CACHING, GETREDIR, INFO, SETNAME, GETNAME, and REPLY\r\n\r\nSTRALGO\r\nNo changes.\r\n\r\nPUBSUB\r\nNo changes.\r\n\r\nCLUSTER\r\nChanges:\r\n1. Dropped \"admin in countkeysinslots, getkeysinslot, info, nodes, keyslot, myid, and slots\r\n\r\nSENTINEL\r\nNo changes.\r\n\r\n(note that DEBUG also fits, but we decided not to convert it since it's for\r\ndebugging and anyway undocumented)\r\n\r\n## New sub-command\r\nThis commit adds another element to the per-command output of COMMAND,\r\ndescribing the list of subcommands, if any (in the same structure as \"regular\" commands)\r\nAlso, it adds a new subcommand:\r\n```\r\nCOMMAND LIST [FILTERBY (MODULE <module-name>|ACLCAT <cat>|PATTERN <pattern>)]\r\n```\r\nwhich returns a set of all commands (unless filters), but excluding subcommands.\r\n\r\n## Module API\r\nA new module API, RM_CreateSubcommand, was added, in order to allow\r\nmodule writer to define subcommands\r\n\r\n## ACL changes:\r\n1. Now, that each subcommand is actually a command, each has its own ACL id.\r\n2. The old mechanism of allowed_subcommands is redundant\r\n(blocking/allowing a subcommand is the same as blocking/allowing a regular command),\r\nbut we had to keep it, to support the widespread usage of allowed_subcommands\r\nto block commands with certain args, that aren't subcommands (e.g. \"-select +select|0\").\r\n3. I have renamed allowed_subcommands to allowed_firstargs to emphasize the difference.\r\n4. Because subcommands are commands in ACL too, you can now use \"-\" to block subcommands\r\n(e.g. \"+client -client|kill\"), which wasn't possible in the past.\r\n5. It is also possible to use the allowed_firstargs mechanism with subcommand.\r\nFor example: `+config -config|set +config|set|loglevel` will block all CONFIG SET except\r\nfor setting the log level.\r\n  NOTE: this capability was later removed in #10147\r\n6. All of the ACL changes above required some amount of refactoring.\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n1. There are two approaches: Either each subcommand has its own function or all\r\n   subcommands use the same function, determining what to do according to argv[0].\r\n   For now, I took the former approaches only with CONFIG and COMMAND,\r\n   while other commands use the latter approach (for smaller blamelog diff).\r\n2. Deleted memoryGetKeys: It is no longer needed because MEMORY USAGE now uses the \"range\" key spec.\r\n4. Bugfix: GETNAME was missing from CLIENT's help message.\r\n5. Sentinel and Redis now use the same table, with the same function pointer.\r\n   Some commands have a different implementation in Sentinel, so we redirect\r\n   them (these are ROLE, PUBLISH, and INFO).\r\n6. Command stats now show the stats per subcommand (e.g. instead of stats just\r\n   for \"config\" you will have stats for \"config|set\", \"config|get\", etc.)\r\n7. It is now possible to use COMMAND directly on subcommands:\r\n   COMMAND INFO CONFIG|GET (The pipeline syntax was inspired from ACL, and\r\n   can be used in functions lookupCommandBySds and lookupCommandByCString)\r\n8. STRALGO is now a container command (has \"help\")\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes:\r\n1. Command stats now show the stats per subcommand (see (5) above)\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n- [x] need to update the acl topic in redis.io (both the categories and the sub-commands) - with some note about redis

of changes:\r\n1. Rename `redisCommand->name` to `redisCommand->declared_name`, it is a const char * for native commands and SDS for module commands.\r\n2. Store the [sub]command fullname in `redisCommand->fullname` (sds).\r\n3. List subcommands in `ACL CAT`\r\n4. List subcommands in `COMMAND LIST`\r\n5. `moduleUnregisterCommands` now will also free the module subcommands.\r\n6. RM_GetCurrentCommandName returns full command name\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n1. Add `addReplyErrorArity` and `addReplyErrorExpireTime`\r\n2. Remove `getFullCommandName` function that now is useless.\r\n3. Some cleanups about `fullname` since now it is SDS.\r\n4. Delete `populateSingleCommand` function from server.h that is useless.\r\n5. Added tests to cover this change.\r\n6. Add some module unload tests and fix the leaks\r\n7.
