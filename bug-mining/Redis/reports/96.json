The function sets the connection state to `CONN_STATE_ERROR` and the last error to `ETIMEDOUT`, but then proceeds to assign the file descriptor and state as if the connection was successful, without returning an error code.\r\n\r\n\r\n**To reproduce**\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to the internal error handling logic and may not be easily reproducible without modifying the source to simulate an `aeWait` failure. The relevant code section is:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nif ((aeWait(fd, mask: AE_WRITABLE, milliseconds: timeout) & AE_WRITABLE) == 0) {\r\n    conn->state = CONN_STATE_ERROR;\r\n    conn->last_errno = ETIMEDOUT;\r\n    // Potentially missing return C_ERR here\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nWhen aeWait fails, whether due to a timeout or any other reason, the expected behavior would be for connSocketBlockingConnect to return C_ERR, indicating the connection attempt was unsuccessful. This would be in line with the handling of the initial connection attempt, where a failure to connect does return C_ERR.\r\n\r\n**Additional information**\r\n\r\n- The issue was observed in the connSocketBlockingConnect function where the second if condition checks for writability using aeWait.\r\n- The lack of a return statement following the setting of CONN_STATE_ERROR may result in the function incorrectly proceeding as if the connection was established.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"oranagra","id":7045099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDUwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7045099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra","html_url":"https://github.com/oranagra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/12900/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/12900/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
