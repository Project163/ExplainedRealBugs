time during execution of scripts and all other commands.\r\nThis means that a key is either expired or not, and doesn't change\r\nstate during a script execution. resolves #10182\r\n\r\nThis PR try to add a new `commandTimeSnapshot` function.\r\nThe function logic is extracted from `keyIsExpired`, but the related\r\ncalls to `fixed_time_expire` and `mstime()` are removed, see below.\r\n\r\nIn commands, we will avoid calling `mstime()` multiple times\r\nand just use the one that sampled in call. The background is,\r\ne.g. using `PEXPIRE 1` with valgrind sometimes result in the key\r\nbeing deleted rather than expired. The reason is that both `PEXPIRE`\r\ncommand and `checkAlreadyExpired` call `mstime()` separately.\r\n\r\nThere are other more important changes in this PR:\r\n1. Eliminate `fixed_time_expire`, it is no longer needed. \r\n   When we want to sample time we should always use a time snapshot. \r\n   We will use `in_nested_call` instead to update the cached time in `call`.\r\n2. Move the call for `updateCachedTime` from `serverCron` to `afterSleep`.\r\n    Now `commandTimeSnapshot` will always return the sample time, the\r\n    `lookupKeyReadWithFlags` call in `getNodeByQuery` will get a outdated\r\n    cached time (because `processCommand` is out of the `call` context).\r\n    We put the call to `updateCachedTime` in `aftersleep`.\r\n3. Cache the time each time the module lock Redis.\r\n    Call `updateCachedTime` in `moduleGILAfterLock`, affecting `RM_ThreadSafeContextLock`\r\n    and `RM_ThreadSafeContextTryLock`\r\n\r\nCurrently the commandTimeSnapshot change affects the following TTL commands:\r\n- SET EX / SET PX\r\n- EXPIRE / PEXPIRE\r\n- SETEX / PSETEX\r\n- GETEX EX / GETEX PX\r\n- TTL / PTTL\r\n- EXPIRETIME / PEXPIRETIME\r\n- RESTORE key TTL\r\n\r\nAnd other commands just use the cached mstime (including TIME).\r\n\r\nThis is considered to be a breaking change since it can break a script that uses a loop to wait for a key to

seeing a few issues here that we need to resolve for the upcoming Redis 7.2 release:\r\n- [x] The internal encoding has changed 1 spot to listpack, which is correct from https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11303, but is missing in the docs at https://redis.io/commands/object-encoding/ (fixed in tests themselves)\r\n- [x] The `HackyGetPerf` reliably returns 0 now, regardless of how long has passed (e.g. upping iterations tremendously)...this may legit be bugged.\r\n- [x] `StreamAutoClaim_IncludesDeletedMessageId` expectations are broken, not sure what to make of this yet but it's an odd change to hit between 7.0 and 7.2 versions.\r\n\r\nNote: no release notes because these are all test tweaks.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/issues/2454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/issues/2454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9966093594,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAJhcs5CavUlzwAAAAJSBoUa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/events/9966093594","actor":{"login":"enjoy-binbin","id":22811481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODExNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22811481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin","html_url":"https://github.com/enjoy-binbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/enjoy-binbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9f0966e27d0c110dc44707874fbeecfbe063db92","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/enjoy-binbin/redis/commits/9f0966e27d0c110dc44707874fbeecfbe063db92","created_at":"2023-07-31T16:16:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
