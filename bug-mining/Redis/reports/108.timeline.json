this PR (lpInsert dose that conversion implicitly).\r\n\r\nBut to do that, we would have first converted the score from double to string (calling `d2string`),\r\nthen pass the string to `lpAppend` which identified it as being an integer and convert it back to an int.\r\nNow, instead of converting it to a string, we store it using lpAppendInteger`.\r\n\r\nUnrelated:\r\n---\r\n* Fix the double2ll
