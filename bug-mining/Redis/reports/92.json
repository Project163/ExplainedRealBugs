In the given code snippet, the condition if (!fd) is used to check if open() failed. However, this condition will evaluate to true if the file descriptor is 0, which could be a valid value.\r\n\r\nredis/src/debug.c.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, you should check if open() returned -1 specifically to determine if it failed. The correct condition would be if (fd == -1).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/redis/redis/assets/73597061/4d379e0c-db38-451e-ba6e-7474c020cd8b)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"oranagra","id":7045099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDUwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7045099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra","html_url":"https://github.com/oranagra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oranagra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/12938/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/redis/issues/12938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
