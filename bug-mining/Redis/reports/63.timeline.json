PR handles several aspects\r\n1. Calls to RM_ReplyWithError from thread safe contexts don't violate thread safety.\r\n2. Errors returning from RM_Call to the module aren't counted in the statistics (they might be handled silently by the module)\r\n3. When a module propagates a reply it got from RM_Call to it's client, then the error statistics are counted.\r\n\r\nThis is done by:\r\n1. When appending an error reply to the output buffer, we avoid updating the global error statistics, instead we cache that error in a deferred list in the client struct.\r\n2. When creating a RedisModuleCallReply object, the deferred error list is moved from the client into that object.\r\n3. when a module calls RM_ReplyWithCallReply we copy the deferred replies to the dest client (if that's a real client, then that's when the error statistics are updated to the server)\r\n\r\nNote about RM_ReplyWithCallReply: if the original reply had an array with errors, and the module\r\nreplied with just a portion of the original reply, and not the entire reply, the errors are currently not\r\npropagated and the errors stats will not get propagated.\r\n\r\nFix
