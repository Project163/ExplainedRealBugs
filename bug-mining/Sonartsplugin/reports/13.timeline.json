Shall investigate (or feel free to create a PR)\n\n\n\n-------- Original message --------\nFrom: sevaru <notifications@github.com>\nDate: 20/01/2017 09:41 (GMT+00:00)\nTo: Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin <SonarTsPlugin@noreply.github.com>\nCc: Subscribed <subscribed@noreply.github.com>\nSubject: [Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin] Add option to specify tslint output as a file (#91)\n\n\nIt's more like a question then a bug.\n\nTL,TR\n\n  *   Add option to set file with tslint results.\n\nIn our project \"myproject\" (sonar project, one git repo) we have a problem.\nIt consist of several web project (framework, sample-app, tests, etc).\nAll of them compiled independently (each has it's package.json, tsconfig.json, etc).\nBut we need to collect all the quality data in one place (\"myproject\").\n\nFailed solution\nMy first attempt is to create single tslint.json and tsconfig.json for tslint but\n\"--type-check\" option requires this project to be compilable.\nSo, we have duplicate dependencies (e.g. framework has it's own d.ts files for kendo in node_modules and sample-app has it's own dependency on framework and kendo as well and has d.ts files of kendo in node_modules too).\nThis is not only for kendo but for other libs too.\n\nCurrent solution\nSo my current suggestion is to run tslint by ourselves for each project separately and concat tslint output to one file and then give it to tslint-sonar plugin.\n\n-\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on
