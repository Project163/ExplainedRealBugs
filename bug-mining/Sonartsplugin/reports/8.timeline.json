wary of bundling a version of `tslint` with the plugin as we've just taken steps to try to decouple the versions of plugin from analysis tool, but if it were configurable at project-level there'd be nothing to stop you running it wherever you wished.\n\nAlternative would be to allow detection of a project-local version of `tslint` in the runner if nothing else is configured (i.e. look for a node_modules\\tslint folder relative to sonar-project.properties) as a default fallback?
