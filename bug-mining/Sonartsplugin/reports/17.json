I'm sorry in advance if this area is inappropriate for this. In case it's OK, here is my case:\r\n\r\nI went through the documentation over here, installed the plugin and analysed a TS project, but I found that the plugin comes with 0 rules for Bugs or Vulnerabilities. This includes the demo Sonar, linked on README.md, so of course any analysis will detect 0 of either on any TS project.\r\n\r\nI'm running Sonar on a Docker container, and the image has TS Lint installed and available on PATH. I tried including \"sonar.ts.tslint.rulesDir=/opt/tools/node-v6.4.0-linux-x64/lib/node_modules/tslint/lib/rules\" on sonar-project.properties (this dir on the container has many .ts files, with rules that came with tslint), but still, 0 bugs/vulnebs. detected.\r\n\r\nIn my case, manually creating and maintaining rules on Sonar application itself is not a viable option.\r\n\r\nAm I missing some configuration or does the plugin not support Bugs and Vulnerabilities yet? Without those, I see little benefit of running a static analysis on a TS project.\r\n\r\nThank you","closed_by":{"login":"Pablissimo","id":1470336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzAzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1470336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo","html_url":"https://github.com/Pablissimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/103/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
