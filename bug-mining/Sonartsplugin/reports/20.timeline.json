There's a machine-level configuration, an application-host level configuration, an application configuration and so on. Settings in lower-down files (nearer to the application) take precedence over higher-up ones, same as SonarQube. But for some settings there're security concerns - what level of sandboxing the application runs with, what proxy settings should be used for network connections etc.\r\n\r\nIn .NET-land, you can lock a section of a configuration file at certain levels, fixing the values at that level and causing an error when an attempt is made to redefine those settings lower down.\r\n\r\nI had hoped that SQ would have something similar - an ability to say, for a given property 'I know what I want this setting to be, and I don't want anything lower down to be able to override it'. So maybe you'd set your custom rules at a global level as just blank, and lock it - preventing an individual project from changing the blank set to something else. Will report back if I hear anything, but suspect it's non-trivial changes.\r\n\r\nAs to your change, shall merge quite happily!","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/comments/280953698/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Pablissimo","id":1470336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzAzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1470336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo","html_url":"https://github.com/Pablissimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":968466590,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk2ODQ2NjU5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/events/968466590","actor":{"login":"Pablissimo","id":1470336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzAzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1470336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo","html_url":"https://github.com/Pablissimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e7eff256186b33c9f3e49f264e84eb6120548c67","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/commits/e7eff256186b33c9f3e49f264e84eb6120548c67","created_at":"2017-02-19T22:13:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":968466591,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTY4NDY2NTkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/events/968466591","actor":{"login":"Pablissimo","id":1470336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzAzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1470336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo","html_url":"https://github.com/Pablissimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"e7eff256186b33c9f3e49f264e84eb6120548c67","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/commits/e7eff256186b33c9f3e49f264e84eb6120548c67","created_at":"2017-02-19T22:13:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
