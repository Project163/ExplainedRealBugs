Best thinking I have so far is, if you've specified a path to tsconfig.json:\r\n- Turn off batching, no longer send a list of files to tslint but trust that tsconfig.json has been setup right\r\n- If tslint reports lint violations for files that aren't in our analysis set as defined by sonar-project.properties, ignore those violations","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/comments/271167041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Pablissimo","id":1470336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzAzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1470336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo","html_url":"https://github.com/Pablissimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/comments/271172834","html_url":"https://github.com/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/75#issuecomment-271172834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/75","id":271172834,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTE3MjgzNA==","user":{"login":"Pablissimo","id":1470336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzAzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1470336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo","html_url":"https://github.com/Pablissimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-08T19:27:31Z","updated_at":"2017-01-08T19:27:31Z","body":"Also - what would you want to achieve by passing --type-check to tslint that your existing CI build isn't capturing?

you pass a project file to tslint it ignores any specific file paths you send it on the command line, so the plug in no longer bothers in that case.\n\nTrick though is that the set of .ts files to be linted as configured by tsconfig.json may not be the same as those under analysis as defined by sonar-project.properties. That warning is just a signal that tslint has reported a lint error against a file that wasn't captured by the sonar runner as part of the analysis set.\n\nThat make any sense?\n\n\n\n-------- Original message --------\nFrom: Nikita <notifications@github.com>\nDate: 19/01/2017 09:12 (GMT+00:00)\nTo: Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin <SonarTsPlugin@noreply.github.com>\nCc: Pablissimo <turnacre@hotmail.com>, Mention <mention@noreply.github.com>\nSubject: Re: [Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin] Pass --project and --type-check parameters to tslint (#75)\n\n\n2017-01-19T09:07:06.9993123Z ##[error]09:07:06.887 WARN: TsLint reported issues against a file that wasn't sent to it - will be ignored: ****.ts 2017-01-19T09:07:07.0002889Z ##[error]09:07:06.887 WARN: TsLint reported issues against a file that wasn't\n sent to it - will be ignored: ****.ts 2017-01-19T09:07:07.0002889Z ##[error]09:07:06.887 WARN: TsLint reported issues against a file that wasn't sent to it - will be ignored: ****.ts\n\n-\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/75#issuecomment-273719442>, or mute the thread<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABZvgNRsr-EKAyeV3OaRxAU4ZAPj-ombks5rTyj6gaJpZM4LLw6B>.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/comments/273734241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Pablissimo","id":1470336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzAzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1470336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo","html_url":"https://github.com/Pablissimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/comments/273744273","html_url":"https://github.com/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/75#issuecomment-273744273","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/75","id":273744273,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3Mzc0NDI3Mw==","user":{"login":"NikitaEgorov","id":10349650,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzQ5NjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10349650?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikitaEgorov","html_url":"https://github.com/NikitaEgorov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikitaEgorov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikitaEgorov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikitaEgorov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikitaEgorov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikitaEgorov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikitaEgorov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikitaEgorov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikitaEgorov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikitaEgorov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-19T10:56:20Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T10:56:20Z","body":"@Pablissimo \r\nNow I change ``TsLintSensor.execute``\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n   String pathAdjusted = file.absolutePath().replace('\\\\', '/').toLowerCase();
