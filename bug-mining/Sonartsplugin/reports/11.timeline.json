The error message goes like that:\r\n\r\n> Problem during processing LCOV report: can't save DA data for line 0 (Line with number 0 doesn't belong to file path/to/file.ts)\r\n\r\nThis happens also in the tests if you change the content of the `angular.lcov` file to contain more than one file analysis:\r\n\r\nE.g. changing `angular.lcov` to : \r\n```\r\nSF:path/to/template/loader.js!path/to/file2.ts\r\nDA:1,3\r\nDA:2,0\r\nDA:3,1\r\nSF:path/to/template/loader.js!path/to/file.ts\r\nDA:1,3\r\nDA:2,0\r\nDA:3,1\r\nend_of_record\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you now run `mvn test` you'll get this output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[...]\r\n[INFO] Running com.pablissimo.sonar.CombinedCoverageSensorTest\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.892 s - in com.pablissimo.sonar.CombinedCoverageSensorTest\r\n[INFO] Running com.pablissimo.sonar.LCOVParserImplTest\r\nWARN  Problem during processing LCOV report: can't save DA data for line 0 (Line with number 0 doesn't belong to file path/to/file.ts).\r\nWARN  Problem during processing LCOV report: can't save DA data for line 4 (Line with number 4 doesn't belong to file path/to/file.ts).\r\nWARN  Problem during processing LCOV report: can't save DA data for line 0 (Line with number 0 doesn't belong to file path/to/file.ts).   \r\nWARN  Problem during processing LCOV report: can't save DA data for line 4 (Line with number 4 doesn't belong to file path/to/file.ts).\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\nTBH: I do not understand why this error occurs. To me it looks like it expects the lcov file to contain only output to the current file under analysis.
