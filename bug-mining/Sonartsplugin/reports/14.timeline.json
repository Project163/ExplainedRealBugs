thanks - same/close enough to my eventual test environment that I'm pretty happy with the fix. So the exclamation mark shouldn't matter (there's logic in the LCOV parser now to split the path on exclamation marks if it fails to resolve the first time), but the process is basically:\r\n\r\n- Try and find the file in the analysis set that the SF line refers to\r\n- If it doesn't map to anything, and it contains an exclamation mark then split on that and try the second half of the line\r\n\r\nOn Linux that works fine, because the path when taken as a whole is not going to be real but at least *valid*, in terms of the file system (/path/to/angular.js!/path/to/something/else/real). On Windows the equivalent string isn't even a valid path, since it has two colons in it so it detonates on the first check.\r\n\r\nIf you're capable of building the project you're welcome to build off the issue86 branch which should have a fix for you, otherwise it'll need to wait until I do a bit of merging and figure out how the heck to refer to the next version without going 1.0 on it (since I was saving that for when the configuration options are all tidied up, as it'll be a horribly breaking change \\o/)","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/comments/273616740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Pablissimo","id":1470336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzAzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1470336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo","html_url":"https://github.com/Pablissimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/comments/273624076","html_url":"https://github.com/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/86#issuecomment-273624076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/issues/86","id":273624076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzYyNDA3Ng==","user":{"login":"Pablissimo","id":1470336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzAzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1470336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo","html_url":"https://github.com/Pablissimo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pablissimo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-18T22:36:04Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T22:36:04Z","body":"[sonar-typescript-plugin-0.99.1-SNAPSHOT.zip](https://github.com/Pablissimo/SonarTsPlugin/files/715212/sonar-typescript-plugin-0.99.1-SNAPSHOT.zip)\r\n\r\nCandidate for, and I can't believe I'm writing this as a version string, v0.99.1 with the above fix.

Scanner Execution (#86)\n\n\n@Pablissimo<https://github.com/Pablissimo>, I was able to test your fix today and it worked like a charm, congrats on fixing the bug. Your angularwindowspaths.lcov resource file looks pretty much like my path file and your changes to the LCOVParserImpl class caught the InvalidPathException exception without a problem. Thanks for the hard work you are doing.\n\nI would like to ask why you didn't want to use the Semantic Versioning?\n\n-\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email
