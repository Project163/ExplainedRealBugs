Jcabi-aether returns all of them instead. \n\nIt seem that the root of this problem is in the Classpath class:\n\nThis code:\n\n```\n                final Artifact newer = Classpath.newer(child, found);\n                if (newer.equals(child)) {\n                    artifacts.remove(found);\n                    artifacts.add(newer);\n                }\n```\n\ncontains a condition that is true only when the newer object is a current child. But what if the opossite holds? The current (older) child is added to the \"artefacts\" list, which already contains the newer artefact. The result is that I have two artefacts differing only in their versions in the list.\n\nI am not sure if the supposed algorithm is correct either. Does Maven really selects a newer version?  \n","closed_by":{"login":"kjezek","id":7114574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMTQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7114574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjezek","html_url":"https://github.com/kjezek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjezek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjezek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjezek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjezek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjezek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjezek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjezek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjezek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjezek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-aether/issues/48/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-aether/issues/48/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
