For some reason Aether cannot find it, hence it writes out 'without authentication'..\n\nSee line 292 in http://aether.jcabi.com/xref/com/jcabi/aether/Aether.html\n","closed_by":{"login":"quartelh","id":9598247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1OTgyNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9598247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quartelh","html_url":"https://github.com/quartelh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quartelh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quartelh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quartelh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quartelh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quartelh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quartelh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quartelh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quartelh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quartelh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-aether/issues/56/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jcabi/jcabi-aether/issues/56/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
