I expect it to trigger that. However, if you do this:\n\n    # Register dummy listener to force Connection's dispatch descriptor to join with Engine's\n    sqlalchemy.event.listen(engine, \"before_execute\", noop_fn)\n    sess = Session()\n    sess.query(A).all()\n    sqlalchemy.event.listen(engine, \"before_execute\", before_execute_cb)\n    sess.query(A).all() # <--- USE THE SAME SESSION AS BEFORE\n\nThis time, the second query *does* trigger before_execute_cb.\n\nA full set of cases: \nhttps://gist.github.com/inconshreveable/9300571\n\nThis is a very subtle problem in the initialization of the dispatcher on Connection objects. The bug is here:\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/src/fa23570a338b53c813b6342fba0cacd4f5e61384/lib/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py?at=master#cl-66\n\nI'm not well-versed enough in SQLAlchemy design to decide how to solve this, but my suggestion is probably:\n\nConnection objects should *always* join with the Engine's dispatch object and when registering a new event listener on the Engine's dispatch object, it needs to iterate each open connection and set _has_events to True.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/2978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/2978/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
