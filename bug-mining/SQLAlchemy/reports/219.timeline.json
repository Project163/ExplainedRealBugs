issue, originally created by Elmer de Looff ([@edelooff](https://github.com/edelooff))**\n\nThe [events documentation](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/core/event.html#named-argument-styles) notes that since 0.9, the listens_for event decorator accepts a keyword `named`. With this, event arguments are provided as a dict. This works fine for the example of the Pool event, but fails for Engine events (for the current 0.9.7 release).\n\nA testcase to reproduce this and traceback are included as attachments. The relevant code is also included below:\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy.event import listens_for\nfrom sqlalchemy.engine import Engine\n\n@listens_for(Engine, 'before_execute', named=True)\ndef intercept_execute(conn, **kw):\n    print conn.engine.url\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [traceback.log](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/3201/traceback.log) | [engine_event_fail.py](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/3201/engine_event_fail.py)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3201/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
