issue, originally created by Aleksandr Osipov ([@oas89](https://github.com/oas89))**\n\nSorting order is messed up if we replace existing list with new one with some items removed.\nThis happens in the function orm.collections.bulk_replace, when removing items missing in new collection from old one in order to fire events.\n\nCalling .remove method of ordering_list cause reordering of items in old collection, but this also affects ordering in new collection.\n\nChanging two loops in orm.collections.bulk_replace seems to solve the problems.\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [ordering.py](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/3191/ordering.py) |
