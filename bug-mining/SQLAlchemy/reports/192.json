issue, originally created by Oded Argon ([@oargon](https://github.com/oargon))**\n\nI remeber that this worked on previous versions but I'm not sure when it stopped working.\nIt seems like there are no longer log lines when a connection is being checked out from the pool, only when it is returned back to the pool.\n\nTested with 0.9.7.\n\nThe output for running the attached test file is:\nDEBUG:sqlalchemy.pool.QueuePool:Created new connection <pymysql.connections.Connection object at 0x7f129737d3d0>\nDEBUG:sqlalchemy.pool.QueuePool:Connection <pymysql.connections.Connection object
