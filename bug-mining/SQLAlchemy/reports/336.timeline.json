Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\nif you can provide self-contained tests cases rather than pointing me to full applications, that would be very helpful.  As it turns out, I can identify from the query here what it's doing in order to make a test case, but anyone else attempting to triage this wouldn't have enough information to go on. \n\nHere's the test case:\n\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import *\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import *\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n\nclass A(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'a'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n\n    bs = relationship(\"B\", lazy=False)\n\n\nclass B(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'b'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    a_id = Column(ForeignKey('a.id'))\n\ne = create_engine(\"postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost/test\", echo=True)\nBase.metadata.create_all(e)\n\ns = Session(e)\n\nq = s.query(A, func.count(B.id).label('count_1')).join(A.bs)\nq = q.order_by('count_1 desc').group_by(A.id).limit(5)\n\nprint(q.all())\n\n```\n\nWhat is happening is that new logic described in http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/changelog/migration_10.html#order-by-and-group-by-are-special-cases is being sucked into a behavior used by eager loading, where it attempts to add columns to the columns clause of a subquery so that ORDER BY works when it is wrapped.\n\nThe immediate solution is that because you are using text to represent the exact SQL you want, you should be using text() so that Core/ORM knows this is a literal textual construct that isn't to be interpreted:\n\n```\nq = s.query(A, func.count(B.id).label('count_1')).join(A.bs)\nq = q.order_by(text('count_1 desc')).group_by(A.id).limit(5)\n\n```\n\nthis unfortunately is another 1.0 regression however as the textual reference produced by order_by('foo') isn't appropriate for copying into the columns clause.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441928803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441928817","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3392#issuecomment-441928817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3392","id":441928817,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyODgxNw==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-27T19:53:40Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:45:19Z","body":"**Changes
