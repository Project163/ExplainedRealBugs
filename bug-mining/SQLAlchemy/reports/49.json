For example, looking at http://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/browser/sqlalchemy/trunk/examples/sharding/attribute_shard.py , I can't easily tell where to find \"mapper\".  I can find it by searching through http://www.sqlalchemy.org/docs/04/docstrings.html , but I wish I could just find its full\"\n\nThis would help solidify the seperation of concerns in the sql / orm layers too.  Also, if this gets done, run pyflakes on all of these to check for cruft.\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [examples.diff](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/717/examples.diff) | [examples.2.diff](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/717/examples.2.diff)\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/717/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
