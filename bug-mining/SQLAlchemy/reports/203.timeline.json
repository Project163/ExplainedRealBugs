The following test case outlines the problem:\n\n```python\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\n\nengine = sa.create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')\nBase = declarative_base()\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nsession = Session()\n\n\nclass TextItem(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'text_item'\n    id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, primary_key=True)\n\n    type = sa.Column(sa.Unicode(255))\n\n    __mapper_args__ = {\n        'polymorphic_on': type,\n        'with_polymorphic': '*'\n    }\n\n\nclass Article(TextItem):\n    __tablename__ = 'article'\n    id = sa.Column(\n        sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey(TextItem.id), primary_key=True\n    )\n    __mapper_args__ = {\n        'polymorphic_identity': u'article'\n    }\n\n\nclass Tag(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'tag'\n    id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    text_item_id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey(TextItem.id))\n\n\nTextItem.tag_count = sa.orm.column_property(\n    sa.select(\n        [\n            sa.func.count('1')\n        ],\n    )\n    .select_from(Tag.__table__)\n    .where(Tag.__table__.c.text_item_id == Tag.__table__.c.id)\n    .correlate(TextItem.__table__)\n    .label('tag_count')\n)\n\n\nprint session.query(TextItem) \n```\n\nThis gives me (notice the anon_1 alias for the labeled column property):\n\n```\nSELECT text_item.id AS text_item_id, text_item.type AS text_item_type, (SELECT count(:param_1) AS count_1\nFROM tag\nWHERE tag.text_item_id = tag.id) AS anon_1, article.id AS article_id\nFROM text_item LEFT OUTER JOIN article ON text_item.id = article.id\n```\n\nThe expected query would be\n\n```\nSELECT text_item.id AS text_item_id, text_item.type AS text_item_type, (SELECT count(:param_1) AS count_1\nFROM tag\nWHERE tag.text_item_id = tag.id) AS tag_count, article.id AS article_id\nFROM text_item LEFT OUTER JOIN article ON text_item.id = article.id\n```\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3148/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-27T05:36:31Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:36:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3178","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3178/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3178/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3178/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3178","id":384631731,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODQ2MzE3MzE=","number":3178,"title":"overhaul

issue, originally created by Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek))**\n\ntook 5 minutes to actually look at the warnings registry.  Let's change our long standing approach of parameterized warnings, e.g. for unicode and other things where it really helps to see the value, and just go for no registry for these.   We will augment warn() to accept *args that can be interpolated; if these are present, we skip the registry.\n\nAlso, if we just re-implement warnings.warn(), we can do the stack frame stuff they are doing there anyway and express it in terms of the application outside of sqlalchemy without guessing on stacklevel.\n\nthis applies to #2992 as well as we want to warn for textual strings and I'd really like to put the string in the warning.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3178/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-27T05:36:58Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:36:58Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3188","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3188/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3188/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3188/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3188","id":384631829,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODQ2MzE4Mjk=","number":3188,"title":"regression
