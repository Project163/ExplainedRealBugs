We'd tried @dbase?mode=2 and @/dbase?mode=2; I hadn't realized @dbase/?mode=2 would be the magic word.\n\nPlease discard this patch; I would, however, like to suggest that clarifying example syntax be added to the documentation, such as \"oracle://user:pass@host:port/dbname[?key=value&key=value...](?key=value&key=value...) (or, when a TNS name is used, oracle://user:pass@tnsname[/?key=value&key=value...) \" be added to the documentation - I really never would have guessed this syntax on my own.  I can see now that it makes sense, if I carefully read that \"TNS name\" takes \"host\"'s place in the URL.  It just doesn't look intuitive, since I think of a TNS name as a dbname, not a host name - a host can hold dozens of databases.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441904123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441904124","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1361#issuecomment-441904124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1361","id":441904124,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkwNDEyNA==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2009-04-01T18:18:18Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T04:26:21Z","body":"**Michael
