issue, originally created by Dobes Vandermeer ([@dobesv](https://github.com/dobesv))**\n\nI am trying to use the \"baked query\" pattern to reduce the time spent generating SQL, which currently is quite significant for our app.\n\nOne thing I can't seem to parameterize using a bindparam, however, is the limit on the query.\n\nAlthough in #805 the limit was changed into a bindparam, this doesn't allow me to provide my own bindparam but rather always creates its own bindparam, assuming the limit I procide is a number already.\n\nI think that if the places where currently it wraps a numeric limit into a bindparam using sql.literal() it would also check if limit was already a bindparam then it would be good.\n\nHere's an example that can be pasted into the test suite:\n\n```\n    def test_select_with_bindparam_limit(self):\n        \"\"\"Does a query allow bindparam for the limit?\"\"\"\n        sess = create_session()\n        users = []\n\n        q1 = sess.query(self.classes.User).order_by(self.classes.User.id).limit(sa.bindparam('n'))\n        for n in xrange(1,4):\n            users[:] = q1.params(n=n).all()\n            assert len(users) == n\n```\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
