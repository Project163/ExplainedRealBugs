issue, originally created by Adrian ([@thiefmaster](https://github.com/thiefmaster))**\n\nE.g. in this example:\n\n```\nclass Foo(Base):                                   \n    __tablename__ = 'foo'\n    id1 = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, nullable=False)\n    id2 = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, nullable=False)\n```\n\nI believe it does not make much sense to create `id1` as autoincrement/serial while `id2` is a plain integer columns.\n\nUnless there are database engines which actually support multiple serial columns, I would either disable autoincrement for both columns in that case or raise an error, forcing the user to enable/disable autoincrement explictly.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3216/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
