issue, originally created by Anonymous**\n\nVersions of Firebird prior to 2.0 were subject to the following bug http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/CORE-356\n\nThe gist of CORE-356 is that values in the RDB$DEFAULT_SOURCE column of the RDB$RELATION_FIELDS table can have leading whitespace.\n\nTrying to use meta.reflect on one of these tables results in errors like this:\n\n\n    File \".../site-packages/sqlalchemy/databases/firebird.py\", line 501, in reflecttable\n        assert row['fdefault']('fdefault').upper().startswith('DEFAULT '), row\n    AssertionError: (u'ARCHIVED           ', None, u'TEXT', 0, 1, None, 0, \" DEFAULT 'N'\")\n\nA simple fix for this is to add a TRIM to the tblqry around the COALESCE or since the fdefault value is being modified with .upper anyway line 501 might be a better spot to \"fix\" this\n\n\n    assert row['fdefault']('fdefault').upper().lstrip().startswith('DEFAULT '), row\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1663/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
