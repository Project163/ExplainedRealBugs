issue, originally created by Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek))**\n\nsince #3547, mysql has a JSON type also, the approach we've taken in #3503 needs to be expanded.\n\nCritical is that a base sqlalchemy.sql.sqltypes.JSON type needs to exist analogous to sqlalchemy.sql.sqltypes.Array.   Basic JSON single-index and pathed-index values should then work on PG or MySQL backends equally, which means the operator massaging we see in PG's version of _setup_getitem() as well as the early massaging we see in https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/pull/221/files must be moved to the compiler.   The JSON index operator needs to be a first class operator, and the PG and MySQL dialects will need to handle rendering using a `visit_json_getitem_binary` operator.\n\nAdditionally, the value passed to the index needs to be assembled into another typed object of some kind, that is, it's not actually possible to generically handle an expression like `x['foo']` without this, because the 'foo' value has to be specially string-formatted on the MySQL backend into a JSON_EXTRACT expression, an expression like `x[('foo', 'bar')]` also needs this on MySQL and on Postgresql needs to be formatted as `x#>'{foo, bar}'`.   This implies type-level conversion, e.g. a type such as JsonIndexType which then has a Postgresql and a MySQL implemenation.\n\n\n\n```\n#!\n\nPython                 PG                   MySQL\n--------           --------         ---------------------------\n\ncol['x']           col->'x'         JSON_EXTRACT(col, '$.x')\ncol[5]             col->5           JSON_EXTRACT(col, '$[5]')\ncol[('foo', 1)]    col#>'{foo,1}'   JSON_EXTRACT(col, '$.foo[1]')\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3619/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
