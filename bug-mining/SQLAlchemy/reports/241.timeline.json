So essentially its query(Struc).join(Struc.out_links).join(Struc.in_links, aliased=True) and that is exactly the SQL we get:\n\n```\nSELECT node.id AS node_id, node.name AS node_name, node.type AS node_type \nFROM node JOIN link ON link.start_id = node.id JOIN link AS link_1 ON link_1.end_id = node.id \nWHERE node.type IN (:type_1)\n```\n\nagain if you want Struc and Calc represented separately, you need to aliased() one or both of them, and additionally if you want to join from Link to Calc you need to specify that as well:\n\n\n```\ncalc_alias = aliased(Calc)\n\nq5 = session.query(Struc).\\\n    join(Struc.out_links).\\\n    join(Link.start_node.of_type(calc_alias)).\\\n    join(calc_alias.in_links, aliased=True)\n\n```\n\nI'm assuming Link.start_node, the query doesn't specify which one.  This produces the expected SQL:\n\n```\nSELECT node.id AS node_id, node.name AS node_name, node.type AS node_type \nFROM node JOIN link ON link.start_id = node.id JOIN node AS node_1 ON link.start_id = node_1.id AND node_1.type IN (:type_1) JOIN link AS link_1 ON link_1.end_id = node_1.id \nWHERE node.type IN (:type_2)\n```\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441926622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441926623","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3232#issuecomment-441926623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3232","id":441926623,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyNjYyMw==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-23T04:46:29Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:38:51Z","body":"**Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\nq8 is pretty complicated, and I'm surprised of_type() works with aliased=True but it does.
