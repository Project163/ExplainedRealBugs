In the future `flask db upgrade` will be enough to apply any changes.\r\n\r\n> **Note**\r\n> `flask` commands require setting the environmental variable `FLASK_APP=main`, because this project has `main.py` instead of `app.py`.\r\n\r\n> **Warning**\r\n> `flask db upgrade/downgrade` commands modify the database and can cause data loss. **DON'T RUN DOWNGRADE** if you like your data.
