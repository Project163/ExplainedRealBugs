рамках этой задачи необходимо перенести готовую реализацию эндпойнтов MVP из прототипа в основной репозиторий бэкенда.\r\n\r\nВ процессе реализации были обнаружены некоторые проблемы. Некоторые проблемы были решены сразу, остальные нам предстоит решить в дальнейшем (или придти к тому что и так сойдёт :D ).\r\n\r\n**Заметки по реализации**\r\n\r\nРеализация была сделана \"на коленке\" в короткие сроки с двумя целями, посмотреть что ждёт бэкенд вишера в будущем и предоставить пусть и неокончательную но рабочую реализацию для фронта. Было решено не делить работу на коммиты и тикеты, т.к. какой-то особо интересной истории там не наблюдалось. Вместо этого все решения/проблемы появившиеся в процессе реализации было решено описать в отдельном документе (заодно они продублированы и в этом коммит месседже/тикете).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Решенные проблемы / обнаруженные инсайды**\r\n\r\nпроизводительность тестов страдает из-за вызова bcrypt в фикстурах (т.е. при каждом тесте выполняется работа криптографических функций, которые судя по всему занимают довольно много времени) -- думаю результаты bcrypt можно закэшировать -- ответ про безопасность кеширования результатов bcrypt: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/10520/is-it-safe-or-even-common-to-cache-bcrypt-checks-in-memory  -- закешировал в фикстурах - возможно стоит так же закешировать и в самой модели PasswordHash - в моделях кешировать смысла нет, т.к. соль всегда будет генерироваться уникальной и в кэш мы вряд ли попадём\r\n\r\nВ результате кэширования функции хэширования bcrypt получились примерно такие бенчмарки - последовательный вызов хэширования для одной и той же соли и пароля: 226447, 5, 1, 0, 0, 1 (микросекунды).\r\n\r\nПочему то при добавлении объектов с энамами сильно бьёт по производительности, т.к. например session.add(File(..., extension=Extension.PNG))  - кажется этот тикет описывает ту же проблему https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/7245 - лечится добавлением connect_args={\"server_settings\": {\"jit\": \"off\"}} в вызов create_async_engine()\r\n\r\nДля этого случая бенчмарк настраивать было лень, но для оценки предоставлю примерные данные работы теста: до отключения jit сетап теста выполнялся за ~1.1 секунды, после отключения где-то за ~0.3 секунды. Кажется, неплохо.\r\n\r\nпри вызове session.execute() мы всё равно должны вызвать flush() если хотим чтобы наши изменения отразились в нашей локальной сессии\r\n\r\nЕсли колонка объявлена как mapped_column(ForeignKey(...), primary_key=True) то для неё не надо выставлять autoincrement=False - он подразумевается по умолчанию для всех primary key которые имеют тип ForeignKey\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Обнаруженные проблемы, которые возможно стоит решить в будущем**\r\n\r\nпочему-то много методов копится в модели аккаунта, возможно с этим можно что-то сделать - хотя в основном там только методы на создание и получение, что возможно является логичным, т.к. аккаунт может считаться точкой входа (корнем агрегата) для всех этих операций\r\n\r\n\r\nидея с изоляцией фикстур для каждого пакета тестов особо проблему не решает - среди фикстур начинает появляться точно такая же лапша из цепочек наследования как и раньше, только теперь каждый пакет имеет свою изолированную лапшу. Очевидно, что с увеличением количества функциональности лапша в каждом пакете тестов будет увеличиваться и точно так же станет неподдерживаемой. Возможные решения которые стоит попробовать - либо писать фикстуры без наследования, либо писать отдельно фикстуры для каждого теста, либо придумать какой-то подход с удобным созданием параметризованых фикстур (но это пока не понятно как реализовать)\r\n\r\n\r\nВ тестах частенько забываю запатчить __eq__ из-за этого долго не могу понять в чем проблема, почему объекты бд разные - возможно подход с eq можно как-то переработать\r\n\r\n\r\nнаблюдается утечка энкапсуляции доменных правил, например смотри создание букинга виша - правило о том, что нельзя букать свои виши просто болтается в контроллере, хотя по идее кажется должна быть куда то инкапсулирована (как и другие проверки прав) - но пока не понятно куда инкапсулировать проверки прав - возможно эта проблема решится после выделения доменной области и использования аггрегатов и корней аггрегатов\r\n\r\n\r\nвозможно юрл для роута delete_wish_booking должен содержать путь до виша типа /wishes/42/bookings/18 - стоит помнить о предстоящем переходе архитектуры на bff - возможно эта проблема решится в том контексте\r\n\r\n\r\nне уверен, что стоит использовать model_validate, т.к. хотелось бы явно указывать поля которые войдут в схему, т.к. если произойдёт какое-то изменение в схеме, то данные из модели начнут отдаваться автоматически - не знаю хорошо это или плохо - во всех респонзах где мы используем model_validate без явного перечисления передаваемых полей, мы можем попасть в ловушку, когда эта же схема используется где-то в другом месте, и для этого другого использования мы добавляем какое-то ещё одно поле и это поле автоматически начнёт отдаваться во всех эндпойнтах использующих эту схему\r\n\r\n\r\nВ эндпойнте на удаление букинга сейчас отдаётся 404, если букинг не существует или не принадлежит юзеру. Кажется, что во втором случае надо бы отдавать 403 вместо 404... - стоит помнить о предстоящем переходе архитектуры на bff - возможно эта проблема решится в том контексте\r\n\r\n\r\nвозможно WishBooking.find_by_wish_ids(session, wish_ids) не лучшее название для метода - кажется необходимо придумать какое-то соглашение для всех методов которые получют несколько сущностей по primary key - для случая с одной сущностью у нас есть метод get() а вот в случае с несколькими надо бы подумать\r\n\r\n\r\nсессия алхимии вроде как имеет свойство autoflush, можем ли мы использовать это вместо того чтобы флашить вручную? и нужно ли нам это вообще, или мы всё таки хотим сами контроллировать флашинг?\r\n\r\n\r\nНужно ли нам принимать account_id в схеме NewWishBooking если он может быть получен из токена??? - стоит помнить о предстоящем переходе архитектуры на bff - возможно эта проблема решится в том контексте\r\n\r\n\r\nне совсем понятно стоит ли добавлять created_at в модель Profile - с одной стороны мы вроде как хотим чтобы updated_at и created_at всегда шли в паре (и это звучит логично), но если мы добавим created_at в Profile то необходимо будет обеспечить его синхронизацию с created_at в Account, т.к. аккаунт и профиль создаются одновременно.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/week-password/wlss-backend/issues/184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/week-password/wlss-backend/issues/184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"birthdaysgift","id":35929293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTI5Mjkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35929293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/birthdaysgift","html_url":"https://github.com/birthdaysgift","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/birthdaysgift/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/birthdaysgift/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/birthdaysgift/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/birthdaysgift/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/birthdaysgift/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/birthdaysgift/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/birthdaysgift/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/birthdaysgift/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/birthdaysgift/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-26T21:29:17Z","updated_at":"2024-02-26T21:29:17Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/week-password/wlss-backend/issues/185","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/week-password/wlss-backend","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/week-password/wlss-backend/issues/185/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/week-password/wlss-backend/issues/185/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/week-password/wlss-backend/issues/185/events","html_url":"https://github.com/week-password/wlss-backend/pull/185","id":2155179844,"node_id":"PR_kwDOI-1bVM5n-DHd","number":185,"title":"Перенести

Вместо этого все решения/проблемы появившиеся в процессе реализации было решено описать в отдельном документе (заодно они продублированы и в этом коммит месседже/тикете).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n**Решенные проблемы / обнаруженные инсайды**\r\n\r\nпроизводительность тестов страдает из-за вызова bcrypt в фикстурах (т.е. при каждом тесте выполняется работа криптографических функций, которые судя по всему занимают довольно много времени) -- думаю результаты bcrypt можно закэшировать -- ответ про безопасность кеширования результатов bcrypt: https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/10520/is-it-safe-or-even-common-to-cache-bcrypt-checks-in-memory  -- закешировал в фикстурах - возможно стоит так же закешировать и в самой модели PasswordHash - в моделях кешировать смысла нет, т.к. соль всегда будет генерироваться уникальной и в кэш мы вряд ли попадём\r\n\r\nВ результате кэширования функции хэширования bcrypt получились примерно такие бенчмарки - последовательный вызов хэширования для одной и той же соли и пароля: 226447, 5, 1, 0, 0, 1 (микросекунды).\r\n\r\nПочему то при добавлении объектов с энамами сильно бьёт по производительности, т.к. например session.add(File(..., extension=Extension.PNG))  - кажется этот тикет описывает ту же проблему https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/7245 - лечится добавлением connect_args={\"server_settings\": {\"jit\": \"off\"}} в вызов create_async_engine()\r\n\r\nДля этого случая бенчмарк настраивать было лень, но для оценки предоставлю примерные данные работы теста: до отключения jit сетап теста выполнялся за ~1.1 секунды, после отключения где-то за ~0.3 секунды. Кажется, неплохо.\r\n\r\nпри вызове session.execute() мы всё равно должны вызвать flush() если хотим чтобы наши изменения отразились в нашей локальной сессии\r\n\r\nЕсли колонка объявлена как mapped_column(ForeignKey(...), primary_key=True) то для неё не надо выставлять autoincrement=False - он подразумевается по умолчанию для всех primary key которые имеют тип ForeignKey\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Обнаруженные проблемы, которые возможно стоит решить в будущем**\r\n\r\nпочему-то много методов копится в модели аккаунта, возможно с этим можно что-то сделать - хотя в основном там только методы на создание и получение, что возможно является логичным, т.к. аккаунт может считаться точкой входа (корнем агрегата) для всех этих операций\r\n\r\nидея с изоляцией фикстур для каждого пакета тестов особо проблему не решает - среди фикстур начинает появляться точно такая же лапша из цепочек наследования как и раньше, только теперь каждый пакет имеет свою изолированную лапшу. Очевидно, что с увеличением количества функциональности лапша в каждом пакете тестов будет увеличиваться и точно так же станет неподдерживаемой. Возможные решения которые стоит попробовать - либо писать фикстуры без наследования, либо писать отдельно фикстуры для каждого теста, либо придумать какой-то подход с удобным созданием параметризованых фикстур (но это пока не понятно как реализовать)\r\n\r\nВ тестах частенько забываю запатчить __eq__ из-за этого долго не могу понять в чем проблема, почему объекты бд разные - возможно подход с eq можно как-то переработать\r\n\r\nнаблюдается утечка энкапсуляции доменных правил, например смотри создание букинга виша - правило о том, что нельзя букать свои виши просто болтается в контроллере, хотя по идее кажется должна быть куда то инкапсулирована (как и другие проверки прав) - но пока не понятно куда инкапсулировать проверки прав - возможно эта проблема решится после выделения доменной области и использования аггрегатов и корней аггрегатов\r\n\r\nвозможно юрл для роута delete_wish_booking должен содержать путь до виша типа /wishes/42/bookings/18 - стоит помнить о предстоящем переходе архитектуры на bff - возможно эта проблема решится в том контексте\r\n\r\nне уверен, что стоит использовать model_validate, т.к. хотелось бы явно указывать поля которые войдут в схему, т.к. если произойдёт какое-то изменение в схеме, то данные из модели начнут отдаваться автоматически - не знаю хорошо это или плохо - во всех респонзах где мы используем model_validate без явного перечисления передаваемых полей, мы можем попасть в ловушку, когда эта же схема используется где-то в другом месте, и для этого другого использования мы добавляем какое-то ещё одно поле и это поле автоматически начнёт отдаваться во всех эндпойнтах использующих эту схему\r\n\r\nВ эндпойнте на удаление букинга сейчас отдаётся 404, если букинг не существует или не принадлежит юзеру. Кажется, что во втором случае надо бы отдавать 403 вместо 404... - стоит помнить о предстоящем переходе архитектуры на bff - возможно эта проблема решится в том контексте\r\n\r\nвозможно WishBooking.find_by_wish_ids(session, wish_ids) не лучшее название для метода - кажется необходимо придумать какое-то соглашение для всех методов которые получют несколько сущностей по primary key - для случая с одной сущностью у нас есть метод get() а вот в случае с несколькими надо бы подумать\r\n\r\nсессия алхимии вроде как имеет свойство autoflush, можем ли мы использовать это вместо того чтобы флашить вручную? и нужно ли нам это вообще, или мы всё таки хотим сами контроллировать флашинг?\r\n\r\nНужно ли нам принимать account_id в схеме NewWishBooking если он может быть получен из токена??? - стоит помнить о предстоящем переходе архитектуры на bff - возможно эта проблема решится в том контексте\r\n\r\nне совсем понятно стоит ли добавлять created_at в модель Profile - с одной стороны мы вроде как хотим чтобы updated_at и created_at всегда шли в паре (и это звучит логично), но если мы добавим created_at в Profile то необходимо будет обеспечить его синхронизацию с created_at в Account, т.к. аккаунт и профиль создаются одновременно.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/week-password/wlss-backend/issues/185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/week-password/wlss-backend/issues/185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
