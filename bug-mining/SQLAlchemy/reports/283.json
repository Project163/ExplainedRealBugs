issue, originally created by David Lents ([@dlents](https://github.com/dlents))**\n\ne.g:\nlast_access = Column(TIMESTAMP(), nullable=False, server_default=text('CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP')))\n\nresults in:\n`last_access` timestamp NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n\nThis appears to be caused by dialects/mysql/base.py line 1679:\n\nif not column.nullable and not is_timestamp:\n            colspec.append('NOT NULL')\n\nThis doesn't seem correct, as NOT NULL changes the behavior of timestamp type in mysql if I'm not mistaken.\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments:
