Description\r\n\r\nFixes #8478 \r\n\r\nHandle `UnionType` as arguments to `Mapped`, e.g., `Mapped[str | None]`:\r\n\r\n- adds `utils.typing.is_optional_union()` used to detect if a column should be nullable.\r\n- adds `\"UnionType\"` to `utils.typing.is_optional()` names.\r\n- uses `get_origin()` in `utils.typing.is_origin_of()` as `UnionType` has no `__origin__` attribute.\r\n- tests with runtime type and postponed annotations and guard the tests running with `compat.py310`.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n<!-- go over following points. check them with an `x` if they do apply, (they turn into
