Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\nSo I have a way to make this \"work\" for now, though it requires that it degrades into \"unnested\" behavior in this kind of case.  \n\nWe've built up an eager join from service_server to host, machine, and dns_record:\n\n```\nservice_server \n\tLEFT OUTER JOIN \n\t\t(\n\t\t\thost AS host_1 JOIN machine AS machine_1 ON machine_1.id = host_1.id\n\t\t) ON host_1.id = service_server.host_id \n\tLEFT OUTER JOIN dns_record AS dns_record_1 ON dns_record_1.id = machine_1.primary_name_id\n```\n\nnow we need to also join out to \"branch\".   I guess the ideal with \"nested\" would be that we do this:\n\n```\nservice_server \n\tLEFT OUTER JOIN \n\t\t(\n\t\t\thost AS host_1 JOIN machine AS machine_1 ON machine_1.id = host_1.id JOIN branch ON branch_1.id = host_1.branch_id\n\t\t) ON host_1.id = service_server.host_id \n\tLEFT OUTER JOIN dns_record AS dns_record_1 ON dns_record_1.id = machine_1.primary_name_id\n```\n\nunfortunately I don't know that digging into the clause like that is very simple, I'm not sure that the joined loading strategy is tracking enough information that we can poke around and figure out exactly where the join should hang off from without error-prone heuristics.    So the easier way for now is just to break out of \"nested innerjoin\" more quickly, by adding a more pessimistic check, and we instead get this:\n\n```\nservice_server \n\tLEFT OUTER JOIN (\n\t\t\thost AS host_1 JOIN machine AS machine_1 ON machine_1.id = host_1.id\n\t) ON host_1.id = service_server.host_id \n\tLEFT OUTER JOIN dns_record AS dns_record_1 ON dns_record_1.id = machine_1.primary_name_id LEFT OUTER JOIN branch AS branch_1 ON branch_1.id = host_1.branch_id\t\n```\n\n\nwhich at least is still maintaining one of the inner joins, so still fewer outer joins than not using \"nested\" at all.   This issue really affects 0.9 as well, if someone were using all \"nested\" innerjoins which is only an option there (here it's the default).\n\nthe diff is:\n\n\n```\ndiff --git a/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/strategies.py b/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/strategies.py\nindex 0b2672d..c5158ca 100644\n--- a/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/strategies.py\n+++ b/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/strategies.py\n@@ -1333,7 +1333,8 @@ class JoinedLoader(AbstractRelationshipLoader):\n         assert clauses.aliased_class is not None\n \n         join_to_outer = innerjoin and isinstance(towrap, sql.Join) and \\\n-            towrap.isouter\n+            towrap.isouter and \\\n+            towrap.right.is_derived_from(self.parent.mapped_table)\n \n         if chained_from_outerjoin and \\\n                 join_to_outer and innerjoin != 'unnested':\n\n```\n\nprobably needs a note in strategy_options -> def joinedload() that the \"nested\" feature will pessimistically degrade in the case of multiple paths from the same start point.   \n\ni may try to still make it figure out how to find the best spot within the inner join.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441928168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441928169","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3347#issuecomment-441928169","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3347","id":441928169,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyODE2OQ==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-30T17:29:13Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:43:24Z","body":"**Gabor Gombas wrote:**\n\nIs there a way to control the behavior of innerjoin on a per-backend basis?
