specifically the `_entities` list.\n\nSo if you had say related `User` and `Address` models and some query,\n\n\n```\nq = sess.query(User).filter_by(first_name='John')\n```\n\n\nand a listener,\n\n\n```\n@event.listens_for(SomeQuery, 'before_compile', retval=True)\ndef change_query(query):\n    return query.add_entity(Address).join(Address)\n```\n\n\nYou would expect the query to yield `KeyedTuple` but instead `User` entity is used.\n\nA potential solution would be to change `Query._execute_and_instances` to return,\n\n\n```\nloading.instances(querycontext.query, result, query context)\n```\n\n\ninstead of,\n\n\n```\nloading.instances(self, result, querycontext)\n```\n\nBut this change may have other side-effects?\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3387/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
