issue, originally created by Anonymous**\n\nI found that when using pyodbc, MS SQLserver smalldatetime columns were always returned as a datetime object with only the date components set, and the time missing. \n\nI've attached a one-liner patch to make the MSSQLDialect use MSDateTime_pyodbc instead of MSDate_pyodbc for smalldatetime columns.
