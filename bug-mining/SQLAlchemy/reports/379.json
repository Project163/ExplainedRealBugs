I then compile the filters together and make an SQL query.  Sometimes elements of the filter are `or_`'ed together.  I found that SQLA was smart enough that when an `or_` received a single filter it understood and removed the \"OR\" component of the query.\n\nSo, I could do the following with no issues:  `filter(or_(*or_filters))`\n\nSometimes I find that I get query terms that should basically cause the whole query to fail so I do that by inserting a `False` into the filter.  Doing a `filter(False,  ..snip.. )` works fine.\n\nSince those two aspects work, I was surprised when doing `filter(or_(False))` gave me an exception.\n\n```\n  File \"/sites/metrics_dev/env/lib/python3.4/site-packages/sqlalchemy/sql/elements.py\", line 1941, in or_\n    return cls._construct(operators.or_, False_, True_, *clauses)\n  File \"/sites/metrics_dev/env/lib/python3.4/site-packages/sqlalchemy/sql/elements.py\", line 1857, in _construct\n    return clauses[0].self_group(against=operators._asbool)\nAttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'self_group'\n```\n\nThis is in SQLA 1.0.6\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
