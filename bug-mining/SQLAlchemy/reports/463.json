I'm not sure whether the problem is with SQLAlchemy or psycopg2.\n\nWhenever I try to pass an array index, it gets turned into a bound param (causing an error) unless I wrap the integer in db.text(). \n\nFor example, see the SQLAlchemy query in this blog post:\nhttp://www.jeffwidman.com/blog/881/building-a-postgresql-recursive-cte-in-sqlalchemy/\n\nThere are three lines that include db.text(), and in each case, I think the query should work by just passing a normal integer. Above each line that uses db.text() is a commented out version of what I think the correct syntax should be, followed by what the working version is. \n\nThis isn't blocking me in the least, so it's not a big deal. I just noticed it, and decided to report because I really appreciate the code quality of SQLAlchemy.\n\nIf you need info for debugging, let me know. I'm happy to help, although not sure I understand the intricacies of SQLAlchemy well enough to submit a PR unless the problem is fairly simple. \n\nThanks again for all your hard work on this library. \n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3615/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
