The ForeignKey and ForeignKeyConstraint objects refer to a target column using the \".key\" name of the Column, *unless* the link_to_name flag is set.   The reflection process sets this flag, so that when a table is reflected, the ForeignKeyConstraint objects generated will refer to their target by name and not .key which might be modified.\n\nSo in this case, questions are:  \n\n1. why are your columns coming back as ALL_UPPERCASE, is this Oracle and/or Firebird, otherwise were these names actually created as quoted such that they are case sensitive names?   Note that SQLAlchemy column names should always be declared in all_lowercase, including on Oracle/Firebird, as the casing conventions are automatically converted.\n\n2. what is going on with the in-Python schema defintiions, are there in-Python ForeignKey(Constraint) objects that are referring to the UPPERCASE names but are not setting link_to_name?\n\nThis is why full test cases are absolutely important and without them, it creates work where I have to guess.
