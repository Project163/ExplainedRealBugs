issue, originally created by Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek))**\n\nARRAY, array constructors, ANY, ALL, CONTAINS are all in DB2 as well not to mention the SQL standard.  Oracle has `VARRAY` also which maybe we could support someday.  this is needed for functions like #3132.\n\nAt the moment, PG still has its own operators like contains, contained_by, etc., so I still think people will want to use postgresql.ARRAY.  However, for #3132, we need to do a check on the input type to see if it is already Array.   So I think putting the basic expression stuff into sqltypes.Array would be helpful here, as would an implementation of ANY / ALL.  Ideally ANY/ALL would be able to accept subqueries as well, also SQL standard.  They are *close* to IN in that they accept a subquery in this way but not quite the same.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
