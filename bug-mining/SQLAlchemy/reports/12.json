AFAICT, a CIDR mainly differs from an INET in what is a valid value.  It checks to see that anything that is a zero in the netmask is a zero in the address (ie. 192.168.0.1/16 would be a valid INET, but invalid CIDR).\n\nHere is a patch against 0.4.6 .\n\n--- sqlalchemy/databases/postgres.py\t2008-07-01 10:13:02.000000000 -0600\n+++ sqlalchemy/databases/postgres.py\t2008-07-01 10:14:10.000000000 -0600\n@@ -32,6 +32,10 @@\n     def get_col_spec(self):\n         return \"INET\"\n \n+class PGCidr(sqltypes.TypeEngine):\n+    def get_col_spec(self):\n+        return \"CIDR\"\n+\n class PGMacAddr(sqltypes.TypeEngine):\n     def get_col_spec(self):\n         return \"MACADDR\"\n@@ -200,6 +204,7 @@\n     'float' : PGFloat,\n     'real' : PGFloat,\n     'inet': PGInet,\n+    'cidr': PGCidr,\n     'macaddr': PGMacAddr,\n     'double precision' : PGFloat,\n     'timestamp' : PGDateTime,\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [sqlalchemy.patch](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/1092/sqlalchemy.patch)\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1092/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
