If you're just looking at a database, I'd normally look at the database types, since I tend to be schema-oriented in these cases.  E.g. suppose the python type comes back as \"float\".   Is that a database type of DECIMAL, FLOAT, NUMERIC, what's the scale / precision, etc.?   e.g. \"float\" is useless.
