issue, originally created by Sebastian Bank ([@xflr6](https://github.com/xflr6))**\n\nUsing the postgres double colon shortcut for `CAST(expression AS type)`, e.g.:\n```python\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\nengine = sa.create_engine('postgresql://postgres@/')\nengine.execute('SELECT * FROM pg_attribute WHERE attrelid = %(tab)s::regclass', tab='pg_class')\n```\n\nTrying this with `text`, I think the [docs](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/sqlelement.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.text) would suggest using `\\:`s:\n```python\nengine.execute(sa.text('SELECT * FROM pg_attribute WHERE attrelid = :tab\\:\\:regclass'), tab='pg_class')\n```\nBut this raises `ProgrammingError: (psycopg2.ProgrammingError)` (rendered as `SELECT * FROM pg_attribute WHERE attrelid = %(tab)s\\::regclass`).\n\nAs expected, this also raises:\n```python\nengine.execute(sa.text('SELECT * FROM pg_attribute WHERE attrelid = :tab::regclass'), tab='pg_class')\n```\n(rendered as `SELECT * FROM pg_attribute WHERE attrelid = :tab::regclass`)\n\nThis finally works (extra space): \n```python\nengine.execute(sa.text('SELECT * FROM pg_attribute WHERE attrelid = :tab ::regclass'), tab='pg_class')\n```\nBut is this the intended way?\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3644/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
