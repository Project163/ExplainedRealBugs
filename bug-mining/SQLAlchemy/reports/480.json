As result if we have on second and/or next levels mutable objects (like list, dict) and we modify them, then MutableDict will not marked as dirty/changed and modification will not take effect to database. Thus we'll lose consistency.\nExample.\nWe have next JSON data from database:\n\n```\n{\n    \"key1\": {\"key1.2\": \"value1.2\"},\n    \"key2\": [\"value2.1\", \"value2.2\"],\n    \"key3\": \"value3\",\n}\n```\nIf we pass the data to MutableDict, then it will create next object tree:\n\n**Actual result:**\n```\nm_dict = MutableDict({\n    \"key1\": dict({\"key1.2\": \"value1.2\"}),    # value builtin dict\n    \"key2\": list([\"value2.1\", \"value2.2\"]),  # value builtin list\n    \"key3\": \"value3\"\n})\n\nm_dict['key1']['key1.2'] = 'new_value'   # m_dict doesn't marked as changed\nm_dict['key1'][0] = 'new_value'          # m_dict doesn't marked as changed\n```\n\n\n**Expected result:**\n```\nMutableDict({\n    \"key1\": MutableDict({\"key1.2\": \"value1.2\"}),     # value MutableDict asocciated with JSON\n    \"key2\": MutableList([\"value2.1\", \"value2.2\"]),   # value MutableDict asocciated with JSON\n    \"key3\": \"value3\"\n})\n\nm_dict['key1']['key1.2'] = 'new_value'   # m_dict marked as changed\nm_dict['key1'][0] = 'new_value'          # m_dict marked as changed\n```\n\n**Additional information:**\nTo fix the problem needs to have implemented MutableList https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/issues/3297\n\nNeed to change all builtin mutables in JSON on corresponding associated Mutables from sqlalchemy. BTW Mirantis has already implemented wrappers that fix the bug. It can be usefull https://github.com/openstack/fuel-web/blob/master/nailgun/nailgun/db/sqlalchemy/models/mutable.py\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3646/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
