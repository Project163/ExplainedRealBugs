caveats as far as the order of things so it's unlikely at this point it can be made a default for primary keys.   it would be a good idea to use in cases like these where you expect rows to be switching on the same primary and/or unique keys.\n\nas far as the delete->insert->update taking into account simultaneous changes in relationships, not really sure on that
