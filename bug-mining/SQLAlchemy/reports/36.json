Using the SQL Server driver installed on my machine (version 6.00.6001.18000), I get observe the following behavior when connecting to a database with a custom port number:\n\n>>> pyodbc.connect('driver={SQL Server};server=myserver.example.com,1433;uid=omitted;pwd=omitted')\n<pyodbc.Connection object at 0x01A4A380>\n>>> pyodbc.connect('driver={SQL Server};server=myserver.example.com;port=1433;uid=omitted;pwd=omitted')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\npyodbc.Error: ('08001', '[08001](08001) [Microsoft](Microsoft)[SQL Server Driver](ODBC)[DBNETLIB](DBNETLIB)Invalid connection.

(14); [01S00](01S00) [Microsoft](Microsoft)[SQL Server Driver](ODBC)Invalid connection string attribute (0)')\n\n\nI get the same error if I attempt to use the mssql database dialect in sqlalchemy:\n\nsee http://paste.turbogears.org/paste/9521\n\nTicket #634 originally addressed this issue and it seems to have re-emerged in r4387.\n\nI presume the PORT= syntax works for some drivers, but not for mine.\n\nIf I can provide more information to help resolve this problem, please let me know.  We test against pyodbc and rely on this connection mechanism for our MSSQL databases, so I've marked this as high.  I'll gladly submit a patch, but need to know where the PORT= syntax came from (and if it needs to be supported in certain environments).\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1192/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
