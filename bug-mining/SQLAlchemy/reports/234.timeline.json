I think the only options are some grotty stack inspection inside `public_factory()` to see where it was called from or re-use the `location` argument as in the original post. I've tested that it works as expected:\n\n```\n>>> from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\n>>> import inspect\n>>> inspect.getmodule(relationship)\n<module 'sqlalchemy.orm' from
