issue, originally created by Brian Pantano**\n\nI'm on SQL Server using sqlalchemy 0.9.2.\n\nIt's hard to provide a repro steps without my particular db setup.\n\nBasically table.create will fail because \"There is already an object named 'table' in the database\".\n\nIt's failing because checkfirst=true is executing this SQL:\n\nSELECT [COLUMNS_1].[TABLE_SCHEMA], [COLUMNS_1].[TABLE_NAME], [COLUMNS_1].[COLUMN_NAME], [COLUMNS_1].[IS_NULLABLE], [COLUMNS_1].[DATA_TYPE], [COLUMNS_1].[ORDINAL_POSITION], [COLUMNS_1].[CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH], [COLUMNS_1].[NUMERIC_PRECISION], [COLUMNS_1].[NUMERIC_SCALE], [COLUMNS_1].[COLUMN_DEFAULT], [COLUMNS_1].[COLLATION_NAME] FROM [INFORMATION_SCHEMA].[COLUMNS] AS [COLUMNS_1] WHERE [COLUMNS_1].[TABLE_NAME] = CAST('table_name' AS NVARCHAR(max)) AND [COLUMNS_1].[TABLE_SCHEMA] = CAST('dbo' AS NVARCHAR(max))\n\nis returning zero rows because the owner of the table isn't dbo, but my username.\n\nThis breaks alembic because checkfirst is used on the alembic_version table.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3025/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
