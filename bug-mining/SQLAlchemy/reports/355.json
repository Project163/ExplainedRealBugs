issue, originally created by Raphaël Slinckx**\n\nHere is a test case yielding different results between sqlalchemy 0.9.9 and 1.0+\n\n```python\nimport json\n\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column\nfrom sqlalchemy.types import TypeDecorator, UnicodeText, Integer\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.mutable import MutableDict\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session\n\nclass JSONDictType(TypeDecorator):\n\timpl = UnicodeText\n\n\tdef process_bind_param(self, value, dialect):\n\t\tif value is not None:\n\t\t\tvalue = unicode(json.dumps(value))\n\t\treturn value\n\n\tdef process_result_value(self, value, dialect):\n\t\tif value is not None:\n\t\t\tvalue = json.loads(value)\n\t\treturn value\n\ndef JSON():\n\treturn MutableDict.as_mutable(JSONDictType)\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass MyDataClass(Base):\n\t__tablename__ = 'my_data'\n\n\tid   = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n\tdata = Column(JSON(), default={}, nullable=False)\n\nsession = Session(create_engine(\"sqlite:///:memory:\", echo=True))\nBase.metadata.create_all(session.bind)\n\nm1 = MyDataClass()\nsession.add(m1)\nsession.flush() # Note: without this, the m1.data is None on sqlalchemy 1.0\nm1.data[\"test\"] = 1\nsession.commit()\n\nm2 = MyDataClass()\nsession.add(m2)\nsession.commit()\n\nassert m1.data == {'test': 1}\nassert m2.data == {}\n# With sqlalchemy 1.0 this results in\n# m1.data == {}\n# m2.data == {'test': 1}\n```\n\nAs you can see the default={} seemed to work previously (also the m1.data['test'] = 1 worked without the session.flush() just above)\n\nWith the latest version, the dict provided as default seems to be used and re-used resulting in a process-wide globally shared default dict which can lead to catastrophic leaks in a webapp for example. Also the object needs to be flushed before m1.data is populated.\n\nMaybe this usage was not expected or even discouraged, but I didn't find anything in the docs about this. The closest thing I identified is the change discussed here: http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/changelog/migration_10.html#changes-to-attribute-events-and-other-operations-regarding-attributes-that-have-no-pre-existing-value and possibly the new default handling.\n\nWhat is the expected behavior as of 1.0 ? And how do I get the old behavior using the latest version ?\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3427/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
