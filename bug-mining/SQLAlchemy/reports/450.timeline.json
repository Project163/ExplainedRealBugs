There is an \"eager fetch\" of this rowcount which occurs in the engine for all those statements that are \"CRUD\", which means, they are an update() or delete() construct.  This check does not occur for text() or plain strings.   In 0.9, the eager fetch was unconditional.  The logic was changed to save on performance, CRUD statements via text() are unusual.
