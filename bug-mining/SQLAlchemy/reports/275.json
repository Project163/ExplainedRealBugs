issue, originally created by Sebastian Bank ([@xflr6](https://github.com/xflr6))**\n\nCurrently, reuse of a value for `polymorphic_identity` just overwrites the old mapping.\nThis can lead hard to debug failiures (queried instances having unexpected types):\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String, ForeignKey\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\n\nclass Spam(declarative_base()):\n\n    __tablename__ = 'spam'\n\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    \n    kind = Column(String)\n\n    __mapper_args__ = {'polymorphic_on': kind, 'polymorphic_identity': 'spam'}\n\n\nclass Eggs(Spam):\n\n   __tablename__ = 'eggs'\n\n   id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('spam.id'), primary_key=True)\n\n   __mapper_args__ = {'polymorphic_identity': 'spam'}  # warn here\n\n\nengine = create_engine('sqlite://')\n\nSpam.metadata.create_all(engine)\n\nsession = Session(engine)\n\nsession.add(Spam())\nsession.flush()\nspam = session.query(Spam).one()\n\nassert type(spam) is Spam  # fails\n```\nProvided there is no use case for overwriting, it would be nice to make the user aware of such misconfiguration at an early development stage.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3262/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
