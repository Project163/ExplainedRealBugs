The DDL that the SA MSSQL dialect generates emits no specification of nullability for columns with 'nullable=True' set on their SA Table definition. So a table defined as nullable in its SA definition will have its nullability determined by database setting.\n\nAttached find a test case that illustrates the current behavior and a patch to make the MSSQLSchemaGenerator explicitly emit nullability specifications in all cases.\n\n[0](0) http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa259217(SQL.80).aspx\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [test_mssql_nulls.py](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/1243/test_mssql_nulls.py) | [specify_nullablility.diff](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/1243/specify_nullablility.diff)\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
