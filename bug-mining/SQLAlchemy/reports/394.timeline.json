There is no system in the ORM's flush/insert process right now that distinguishes between a column value of `None` that was set vs. one that was just never set; however, thanks to #3061, this is possible in theory but would need to be tested extremely carefully and still might have backwards-incompatible effects, unless we added a flag to the type itself so that this behavior could be very limited.\n\nworkaround for now is to set a default of None:\n\n    data = Column(JSON(none_as_null=False), default=lambda: None, nullable=False)\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441930520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441930521","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3514#issuecomment-441930521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3514","id":441930521,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkzMDUyMQ==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-17T18:10:56Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:50:13Z","body":"**Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\nthis is the logic change:\n\n\n```\ndiff --git a/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/persistence.py b/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/persistence.py\nindex 0bfee2e..ca24760 100644\n--- a/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/persistence.py\n+++ b/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/persistence.py\n@@ -375,12 +375,15 @@ def _collect_insert_commands(\n \n         propkey_to_col = mapper._propkey_to_col[table]\n \n-        for propkey in set(propkey_to_col).intersection(state_dict):\n+        keys = set(propkey_to_col).intersection(state_dict)\n+        if not bulk:\n+            keys = keys.intersection(state.committed_state)\n+        for propkey in keys:\n             value = state_dict[propkey]\n             col = propkey_to_col[propkey]\n-            if value is None:\n-                continue\n-            elif not bulk and isinstance(value, sql.ClauseElement):\n+            #if value is None:\n+            #
