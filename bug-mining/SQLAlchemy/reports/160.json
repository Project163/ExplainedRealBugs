issue, originally created by Raphael Mutschler**\n\nsince i've updated pg8000 from 1.08 to 1.9.10 i get UnicodeDecodeError when i query a databse that contains any unicode chars (in this special case german umlauts) setting the `encoding='utf-8'` on option in sqlalchemy seems to be ignored completely since 1.9\n\nsome traceback:\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"debug.py\", line
