issue, originally created by Anonymous**\n\nI'm using SqlSoup to reflect a postgresql database.\nthis bug may be related with #821.\n\nThe database use utf-8 as default encoding.\n\nMy goal is to use soup.table.insert(**dict) to insert a bunch of new rows.\n\nthe table looks like that:\n\n    Table('horse', MetaData(Engine(postgres://localhost/minitagedb)), Column(u'horse_id',\n     PGInteger(), table=<horse>, primary_key=True, nullable=False, \n    server_default=DefaultClause(<sqlalchemy.sql.expression._TextClause object at \n    0x8c38f8c>, for_update=False)), Column(u'horse_rev', PGInteger(), table=<horse>), \n    Column(u'horse_color_id', PGInteger(), ForeignKey(u'horse_color.horse_color_id'), \n    table=<horse>, nullable=False), Column(u'breed', PGString(length=255, \n    convert_unicode=False, assert_unicode=None), table=<horse>), Column(u'birthdate', \n    PGDate(), table=<horse>), Column(u'father_id', PGInteger(), \n    ForeignKey(u'horse.horse_id'), table=<horse>), Column(u'mother_id', PGInteger(), \n    ForeignKey(u'horse.horse_id'), table=<horse>), Column(u'breeder_id', PGInteger(), \n    ForeignKey(u'breeder.breeder_id'), table=<horse>), Column(u'birth_origin', \n    PGString(length=4, convert_unicode=False, assert_unicode=None), table=<horse>), \n    schema=None)\n\n\n\nProblem is that you cannot put unicode keywordson that ''insert'' method:\n\n    (Pdb)print h\n    {u'birth_origin': None, u'breeder_id': 1, u'horse_id': 1000, u'mother_id': None,\n     u'breed': 'Dapsens Paint', u'birthdate': datetime.date(1986, 7, 15), \n    u'father_id': None, u'horse_color_id': 1, u'horse_rev': 1}\n    (Pdb) soup.horse_revision.insert(**h)\n    *** TypeError: insert() keywords must be strings\n\n\nThen, now, i workaround like this:\n\n    def insert(table, row): \n        i = table.insert() \n        i.__dict__.update(row) \n\n\nthen, its trivial to do:\n\n    insert(soup.something, dict(id=0, value='a')\n\n\nI tried to insert without unicode encoded keys for the **h** dict too, but it does not work either.\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
