The behavior of emitting a\nwarning and replacing the old column with the same name still\nremains to some degree; the replacement in particular is to maintain\nbackwards compatibility.  However, the replaced column still remains\nassociated with the ``c`` collection now in a collection ``._all_columns``,\nwhich is used by constructs such as aliases and unions, to deal with\nthe set of columns in ``c`` more towards what is actually in the\nlist of columns rather than the unique set of key names.  This helps\nwith situations where SELECT statements with same-named columns\nare used in unions and such, so that the union can match the columns\nup positionally and also there's some chance of :meth:`.FromClause.corresponding_column`\nstill being usable here (it can now return a column that is only\nin selectable.c._all_columns and not otherwise named).\nThe new collection is underscored as we still need to decide where this\nlist might end up.
