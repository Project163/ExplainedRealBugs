issue, originally created by Jeff Dairiki ([@dairiki](https://github.com/dairiki))**\n\nThis is a regression in 0.9.4.\nI suspect this is an issue only with sqlite.\nA test script which exercises the problem is attached.\n\n### Symptoms ###\nWith\n```\nclass A(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'A'\n    id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    typ = sa.Column(sa.Integer, nullable=False)\n    __mapper_args__ = {'polymorphic_on': typ}\n    b_id = sa.Column(sa.ForeignKey('B.id'), nullable=False)\n\nclass A1(A):\n    __tablename__ = 'A1'\n    __mapper_args__ = {'polymorphic_identity': 1}\n    id = sa.Column(sa.ForeignKey(A.id), primary_key=True)\n\nclass A2(A):\n    __tablename__ = 'A2'\n    __mapper_args__ = {'polymorphic_identity': 2}\n    id = sa.Column(sa.ForeignKey(A.id), primary_key=True)\n\nclass B(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'B'\n    id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    a1s = sa.orm.relationship(A1)\n    a2s = sa.orm.relationship(A2)\n```\n\n`sess.query(B).join(B.a1s).union(sess.query(B).join(B.a2s))` compiles erroneously to\n```\nSELECT anon_1.\"B_id\" AS \"anon_1_B_id\" FROM (\n  SELECT \"B\".id AS \"B_id\" \n    FROM \"B\"\n     JOIN (\n       SELECT \"A\".id AS \"A_id\",\n              \"A\".typ AS \"A_typ\",\n              \"A\".b_id AS \"A_b_id\",\n              \"A1\".id AS \"A1_id\" \n         FROM \"A\" JOIN \"A1\" ON \"A\".id = \"A1\".id\n     ) AS anon_2 ON \"B\".id = anon_2.\"A_b_id\"\n  UNION SELECT \"B\".id AS \"B_id\" \n    FROM \"B\"\n     JOIN (\n       SELECT anon_2.\"A_id\" AS \"A_id\", \n              anon_2.\"A_typ\" AS \"A_typ\",\n              anon_2.\"A_b_id\" AS \"A_b_id\",\n              anon_2.\"A1_id\" AS \"A1_id\",\n              \"A2\".id AS \"A2_id\" \n         FROM (\n           SELECT \"A\".id AS \"A_id\",\n                  \"A\".typ AS \"A_typ\",\n                  \"A\".b_id AS \"A_b_id\",\n                  \"A1\".id AS \"A1_id\" \n             FROM \"A\" JOIN \"A1\" ON \"A\".id = \"A1\".id\n         ) AS anon_2\n          JOIN \"A2\" ON anon_2.\"A_id\" = \"A2\".id\n      ) AS anon_3 ON \"B\".id = anon_3.\"A_b_id\"\n) AS anon_1\n```\n\nNote that in the the second part of the union (the part corresponding to `sess.query(B).join(B.a2s)` is effectively joining `A` with both `A1` and `A2`\n(which always results in zero rows, since an A is either an A1 or an A2, never both.)\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments:
