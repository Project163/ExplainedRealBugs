I thought this syntax stopped working, but I found the problem was with Powershell (in which the comma is a special character).\n2) If I use the SQL Native Client, the port= syntax works just fine.\n\nPerhaps the solution is to check the \"driver\" parameter, and if it's \"SQL Server\" use the host,port syntax... and if it's anything else (or \"SQL Native Client\"), use the Port= syntax.
