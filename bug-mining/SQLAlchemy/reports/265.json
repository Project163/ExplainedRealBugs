issue, originally created by Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek))**\n\nthe case of a schema that's been reflected, or otherwise incurs dependencies, is too dependent on simplistic use_alter flags in order to do subsequent schema creates.  introduce an \"auto\" mode that figures this out more naturally at metadata create time, and just knows how to warn/error in the drop case if a name is missing.  allow use_alter to be meaningfully changed after the fact as well.\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import *\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import *\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import
