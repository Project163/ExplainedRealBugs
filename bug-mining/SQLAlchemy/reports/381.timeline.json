The initial cause is that MySQL has an occasional issue where the driver emits a SELECT statement but a set of result rows is not returned, that is, not an empty list, but no columns at all.   I think it's mostly a MySQL server issue but there might be factors within the drivers also that contribute towards it.\n\nFrom that, you've diagnosed correctly that we should put a check around this
