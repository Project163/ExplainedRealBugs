issue, originally created by v ([@vr2262](https://github.com/vr2262))**\n\nIn PostgreSQL I can create a table with an exclusion constraint involving a `CAST` (the `CAST` is necessary because the `UUID` type doesn't have a default operator class for `gist`):\n\n```\nCREATE EXTENSION btree_gist;\nCREATE TABLE example (\n  id         UUID,\n  some_range INT4RANGE,\n  EXCLUDE USING gist (CAST(\"id\" AS TEXT) WITH =, some_range WITH &&)\n);\n```\n\nWhen I try to do the same in SQLAlchemy:\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import *\nfrom sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import (\n    UUID, INT4RANGE, ExcludeConstraint, TEXT\n)\n\nclass Example(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'example'\n    id = Column(UUID)\n    some_range = Column(INT4RANGE)\n    __table_args__ = (\n        ExcludeConstraint(\n            (cast('id', TEXT), '='), ('some_range', '&&')\n        ),\n    )\n```\n\nI get the error `sqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError: Can't add unnamed column to column collection`.\n\n`('id::TEXT', '=')` doesn't work because SQLAlchemy doesn't recognize `'id::TEXT'` as a column.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
