issue, originally created by Priit Laes ([@plaes](https://github.com/plaes))**\n\nWhen trying to automap legacy database which has some issues with foreign key naming I ran into following issue.\n\nHaving following two tables, it barfs because of naming conflict between column `table_b.table_a` and relationship `table_b->table_a`\n```\ntable_a:\nid\n\ntable_b:\nid\ntable_a (foreign key to table_a.id)\n```\n\nError message nicely tells me to `To resolve this, map the column to the class under a different name in the 'properties' dictionary.`, but automap part of documentation doesn't mention much about this case.\n\nI have tried to override the class generation using following constructs, but still fail with error above:\n\n\n```\nclass Table_B(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'table_b'\n    table_a = Column(ForeignKey('table_a.id'))\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments:
