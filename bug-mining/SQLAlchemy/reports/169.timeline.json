issue, originally created by Tony Roberts**\n\nHi,\n\nwhen compiling a query using a dialect that expects positional arguments, when there are CTEs in the expression the positional arguments can end up in the wrong order.\n\nThis is because when visit_select (in sql/compiler.py) is called via visit_cte there are various points where the positional_names don't get passed when building the cte clauses, such as the where clause:\n\n```\n    def visit_select(self, select, asfrom=False, parens=True,\n                            iswrapper=False, fromhints=None,\n                            compound_index=0,\n                            positional_names=None,\n                            force_result_map=False,\n                            **kwargs):\n        ....\n        ....\n\n        if select._whereclause is not None:\n            t = select._whereclause._compiler_dispatch(self, **kwargs)\n            if t:\n                text += \" \\nWHERE \" + t\n```\n\nThis could be fixed by not listing positional_names as an explicit kwarg to visit_select and instead picking it out of the kwargs. That way it will be passed everywhere kwargs is passed without having to check every case, ie:\n\n```\n    def visit_select(self, select, asfrom=False, parens=True,\n                            iswrapper=False, fromhints=None,\n                            compound_index=0,\n                            force_result_map=False,\n                            **kwargs):\n        positional_names = kwargs.get(\"positional_names\")\n```\n\nTo reproduce this problem try a query like this slightly contrived example on a database that uses positional parameters, eg sqlite (although you need a recent version that supports CTEs, I've been testing with 3.8.6).\n\n```\nWITH cte_0 AS (\n SELECT coalesce(table_a.x, '?') AS x, table_a.y as y\n FROM x WHERE x.z == '?'\n),\ncte_1 AS (\n  SELECT coalesce(table_a.x, '?') AS x, table_a.y as y\n  FROM x WHERE x.z == '?'\n), \nSELECT cte_0.x, cte_1.x\nFROM cte_0\nJOIN cte_1 ON cte_0.y = cte_1.y\nWHERE cte_0.x IN (?) AND cte_1.x IN (?)\n```\n\nYou'll find that the params for the cte where clauses get added to the main positiontup list instead of the cte_positional list and so the final parameter order is wrong.\n\nthanks!\nTony\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3213/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-27T05:54:29Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:54:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3615","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3615/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3615/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3615/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3615","id":384635681,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODQ2MzU2ODE=","number":3615,"title":"Postgres
