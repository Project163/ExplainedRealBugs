Kaplov wrote:**\n\nUnfortunately it is not intuitive behaviour. When client wraps JSON structure in Mutable, he expects, that any change of JSON structure will take effect in database, but not only first level. Also most of clients works with mutable objects like with builtin lists and builtin dicts. Client doesn't care about exact object type and ofcourse he doesn't know, that only changes on first level take effect in database. So current design of Mutable objects make them impossible to use safe and comfortable. One example.\n\n```\n# We'll change dict on second level of JSON tree\nm_obj = MutableDict({\n    'k1': {\n        'k2': 'value'\n    }\n})\n\ntmp_dict = m_obj['k1']\ntmp_dict['k2'] = 'new_value'\nm_obj['k1'] = tmp_dict\n```\nA new developer in sqlalchemy, but with good knowledge of python never guess do like above.
