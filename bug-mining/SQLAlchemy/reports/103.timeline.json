The DBAPI passes the date or datetime values right through and a similar thing happens on the result side.\n\nSo as far as \"bug\", it's still not clear to me what your program actually needs to accomplish for which this behavior causes it to fail.   \n\nthe convention of UPPERCASE type objects is that they must match exactly.    So at best, we'd make an oracle DATE type that happens to subclass sqltypes.DateTime.    It cannot refer to sqltypes.DATETIME because that type does not exist on oracle.\n\nHowever, this would also be backwards-incompatible for the very unlikely case that apps are relying upon the very few features that DATE/DATETIME provide, like \"python_type\" or the seldom-used expression adaptations of the + or - operators, that's pretty much it.\n\nBut since you're reporting this as a bug, I'm guessing that maybe you actually are using python_type.
