issue, originally created by jvanasco ([@jvanasco](https://github.com/jvanasco))**\n\nThis kept tripping me up, largely from how searching for `join` data online (or on the docs) eventually directs queries.\n\nit seems that every version of `.join()` within sqlalchemy accepts an `isouter=BOOLEAN` argument -- except for `sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query.join` \n\n    sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query.join(*props, **kwargs)\n    sqlalchemy.sql.expression.join(left, right, onclause=None, isouter=False)\n    sqlalchemy.sql.expression.CLASS.join(right, onclause=None, isouter=False)\n    sqlalchemy.schema.Table.join(right, onclause=None, isouter=False)\n    sqlalchemy.orm.join(left, right, onclause=None, isouter=False, join_to_left=None)\n\nIn practice, they all behave similarly and will accept this form:\n\n    FROM_CLAUSE.join( Class, ClassLeft.on_column == ClassRight.OnColumn )\n\nEverything pretty much works the same... except the `orm.query.Query.join` doesn't work if you pass in `isouter=True`.  You need to call the `outerjoin()` method instead.\n\nThings only get confusing when searching online or in the docs, and you end up looking at the docs for the wrong class.  Passing isouter to a Query.join just raises a generic TypeError that makes it look like you're joining on the wrong columns:\n\n\tTraceback (most recent call last):\n\t  File \"/Users/jvanasco/Desktop/test.py\", line 24, in <module>\n\t\tq1.join( A.id, A.id == A.id, isouter=False)\n\t  File \"/Users/jvanasco/webserver/environments/test-2.7.5/lib/python2.7/site-packages/SQLAlchemy-0.9.7-py2.7-macosx-10.6-intel.egg/sqlalchemy/orm/query.py\", line 1701, in join\n\t\t','.join(kwargs.keys))\n\tTypeError\n\nMy suggestion is for one of two behaviors:\n\n1. `orm.query.Query.join` accepts `isouter` and just proxies the request to `outerjoin()`\n2. if `isouter` is supplied to `orm.query.Query.join`, an informative error is raised that just instructs developers that they're using the wrong class and `outerjoin` is what they want.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
