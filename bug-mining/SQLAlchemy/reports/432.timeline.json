like responding to a failed write in is_disconnect is not always the right thing to do.\n\nIs there any other change you would suggest making within sqlalchemy itself to do this?\n\nIt sounds like I

issue, originally created by Ken Robbins ([@kenrobbins](https://github.com/kenrobbins))**\n\nSimilar to #3585 except a different initial error message.\n\nUsing SQLAlchemy 1.0.12, pymssql 2.1.2, and SQL Server 2012. Here, we performed a DB failover, and the connection became unusable.\n\nFirst error:\n\n```python\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/scoping.py\", line 149, in do\n    return getattr(self.registry(), name)(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/session.py\", line 934, in execute\n    clause, params or {})\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 662, in execute\n    params)\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 761, in _execute_clauseelement\n    compiled_sql, distilled_params\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 874, in _execute_context\n    context)\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 1024, in _handle_dbapi_exception\n    exc_info\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/util/compat.py\", line 195, in raise_from_cause\n    reraise(type(exception), exception, tb=exc_tb)\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 867, in _execute_context\n    context)\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/default.py\", line 324, in do_execute\n    cursor.execute(statement, parameters)\n  File \"pymssql.pyx\", line 467, in pymssql.Cursor.execute (pymssql.c:7569)\n    raise OperationalError, e.args[0]\nOperationalError: (OperationalError) (20017, 'DB-Lib error message 20017, severity 9:\\nUnexpected EOF from the server\\nNet-Lib error during Resource temporarily unavailable (11)\\n')\n```\n\nAll subsequent queries resulted in this error:\n\n```python\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/result.py\", line 790, in fetchone\n    self.cursor, self.context)\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 1027, in _handle_dbapi_exception\n    util.reraise(*exc_info)\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/result.py\", line 781, in fetchone\n    row = self._fetchone_impl()\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/result.py\", line 700, in _fetchone_impl\n    self._non_result()\n  File \"/opt/webapp/svc/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/result.py\", line 720, in _non_result\n    \"This result object does not return rows. \"\nResourceClosedError: This result object does not return rows. It has been closed automatically.\n```\n\nIt appears the DB server is hanging up on the client and the client is not attempting to reconnect, so it stays in this bad state. I propose \"message 20017\" be added to the list of errors considered to be a disconnect.\n\n```\ndiff --git a/lib/sqlalchemy/dialects/mssql/pymssql.py b/lib/sqlalchemy/dialects/mssql/pymssql.py\nindex 32e3bd9..380418b 100644\n--- a/lib/sqlalchemy/dialects/mssql/pymssql.py\n+++ b/lib/sqlalchemy/dialects/mssql/pymssql.py\n@@ -87,6 +87,7 @@ class MSDialect_pymssql(MSDialect):\n             \"Not connected to any MS SQL server\",\n             \"Connection is closed\",\n             \"message 20006\",  # Write to the server failed\n+            \"message 20017\",  # Unexpected EOF from the server\n         ):\n             if msg in str(e):\n                 return True\n```\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3791/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
