are a fairly recent addition, and are available only for the last three releases.\r\nCurrently we use a [github action](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/blob/master/.github/workflows/create-wheels.yaml) to build the wheels and from the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) it does not seem to support the arm architecture in their shared runners.\r\n\r\nAlso at the moment we are using [manylinux2010](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) to generate the linux build, and it does not seem to support the arm architecture. [Manylinux2014](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux#manylinux2014) does seems to support it so we could probably use it for arm.\r\n\r\nAdding arm wheels should be relatively easy once github supports the arm architecture in its runner. The github actions also support private runners (I have to check if they can use the arm architecture) but at the moment I'm not sure if we have plans on adding private runners to use the arm builds

I've yet to take a closer look at the changes, but it seems quite a nice start!\r\n\r\nRegarding the failures, I think we should probably have a key in the profile line that identifies the architecture if different than the classi x86/x64, since the number of function call may depend on it. I can do that change.\r\n\r\nI've also noticed that somehow py35 wheels are broken somehow (not in arm, in the old script). I'll take a look at it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to complete the script with also the upload to pypi and open a PR we can continue there.\r\nIf you want to try a complete run using the test pypi, you can un-comment [this line](https://github.com/odidev/sqlalchemy/blob/arm_support/.github/workflows/create-wheels.yaml#L20) to target the test-pypi and then change the project name in this [setup.cfg line](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/blob/master/setup.cfg#L2) to something unique","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/664530081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CaselIT","id":16175304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc1MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16175304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT","html_url":"https://github.com/CaselIT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/664532679","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/5436#issuecomment-664532679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/5436","id":664532679,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NDUzMjY3OQ==","user":{"login":"CaselIT","id":16175304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc1MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16175304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT","html_url":"https://github.com/CaselIT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-27T17:28:39Z","updated_at":"2020-07-27T17:28:39Z","body":"Another note.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that to create the linux wheel you are using ubuntu 18.04.
