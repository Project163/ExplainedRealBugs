issue, originally created by Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek))**\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import Integer, ForeignKey, Column, String\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session, relationship\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n\nclass A(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'a'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    type = Column(String)\n    cid = Column(ForeignKey('c.id'))\n    c = relationship(\"C\", backref=\"a\")\n    __mapper_args__ = {'polymorphic_on': type}\n\n\nclass B(A):\n    __mapper_args__ =

B).join(B, C.id == B.cid)\n\nprint s.query(C, B).join(B, C.a)\n\n```\n\nfirst query is OK:\n\n\n```\nSELECT c.id AS c_id, a.id AS a_id, a.type AS a_type, a.cid AS a_cid \nFROM c, a \nWHERE c.id = a.cid AND a.type IN (:type_1)\n\n```\n\nsecond query lacks the discriminator:\n\n\n```\nSELECT c.id AS c_id, a.id AS a_id, a.type AS a_type, a.cid AS a_cid \nFROM c JOIN a ON c.id = a.cid\n\n```\n\nthird one is OK:\n\n\n```\nSELECT c.id AS c_id, a.id AS a_id, a.type AS a_type, a.cid AS a_cid \nFROM c JOIN a ON c.id = a.cid AND a.type IN (:type_1)\n\n```\n\nthe issue is the check inside of _join_entities assumes the ON clause was rendered orm.join() which also adds the criteria in.   So this patch resolves:\n\n\n```\ndiff --git a/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/query.py b/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/query.py\nindex 7b2ea79..0c3bc26 100644\n--- a/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/query.py\n+++ b/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/query.py\n@@ -1979,7 +1979,7 @@ class Query(object):\n             info.selectable, \\\n             getattr(info, 'is_aliased_class', False)\n \n-        if right_mapper:\n+        if right_mapper and prop is not None:\n             self._join_entities += (info, )\n \n         if right_mapper and prop and \\\n\n```\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3222/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
