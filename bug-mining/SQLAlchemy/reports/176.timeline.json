Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\nim not seeing the problem here, the docs are IMO extremely clear about what goes on in automap - from http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/orm/extensions/automap.html#relationship-detection: \n\n     The names of the relationships are determined using the\n     :paramref:`.AutomapBase.prepare.name_for_scalar_relationship` and\n     :paramref:`.AutomapBase.prepare.name_for_collection_relationship`\n     callable functions.  It is important to note that the default relationship\n     naming derives the name from the **the actual class name**.  If you've\n     given a particular class an explicit name by declaring it, or specified an\n     alternate class naming scheme, that's the name from which the relationship\n     name will be derived. \n\nthe functions which do the work here are named and linked to their docstrings.  the naming scheme for the class is described right above at http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/orm/extensions/automap.html#overriding-naming-schemes.  It includes a complete example of how to change this scheme.  We can cut-and-paste it directly into your test script and the error goes away:\n\n\n```\nimport re\ndef camelize_classname(base, tablename, table):\n    \"Produce a 'camelized' class name, e.g. \"\n    \"'words_and_underscores' -> 'WordsAndUnderscores'\"\n\n    return str(tablename[0].upper() + \\\n            re.sub(r'_(\\w)', lambda m: m.group(1).upper(), tablename[1:]))\n\nBase = automap_base()\n\n\nclass TableB(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'table_b'\n    table_a = Column(ForeignKey('table_a.id'))\n\nBase.prepare(engine, reflect=True, classname_for_table=camelize_classname)\n\n```\n\nI will note that the automap extension is not one of those things that \"just works\" with absolutely no planning, if I were using this for the first time and didn't have time to read any docs, I'd probably be annoyed, but if the docs are read fully I think everything that's happening here should be clear.
