For the insert, this can be worked around by giving it a \"key\":\n\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table, Column, Integer\n\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost:5432/test', echo=True)\nmeta = MetaData(engine)\ntable = Table('test_parentheses', meta,\n    Column('CT Volume (cc)', Integer, key='foob')\n)\ntable.create()\n\ni = table.insert()\ni.execute({'foob': 1})\n```\n\nwhich emits:\n\n```\nINSERT INTO test_parentheses (\"CT Volume (cc)\") VALUES (%(foob)s)\n2014-11-10 15:30:46,631 INFO sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine {'foob': 1}\n```\n\nfor other expressions, it is not yet using the \".key\", such as `table.select().where(table.c.foob == 5)`, so unfortunately .key is not yet a general solution.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441926772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441926781","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3245#issuecomment-441926781","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3245","id":441926781,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyNjc4MQ==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-10T20:35:39Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:39:20Z","body":"**Changes

It is extremely inefficient for SQLAlchemy to unconditionally run translation through the parameter dictionary, so I don't know that I want a totally transparent system, this is what happens:\n\nconn.execute(table.insert(), [{\"Col Value (one)\": 1}, {\"Col Value (two)\": 2}, ... <for 10000 rows>)\n\nAbove, if the statement renders the parameter as \"Col Value _one_\", that indicates that for every one of 10000 parameter sets we need to make copies of each dictionary with the new parameter name within it.  So a program might find that it suddenly runs dramatically slower once a column of a certain name is added to a table, and that tends to be the kind of issue that makes people very upset.\n\nSo two other approaches that can work here are:\n\none, don't use \"pyformat\" paramstyle with Pandas.  Use \"format\".    In fact I think this is probably what you should do, as this solves everything:\n\n\n```\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost:5432/test', echo=True, paramstyle='format')\n\n```\n\nthis is a positional style, which does incur the translation of parameter dictionaries into tuples, but at least here you are telling it to do so, and the whole program runs fine:\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData, Table, Column, Integer\n\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost:5432/test', echo=True, paramstyle='format')\nmeta = MetaData(engine)\ntable = Table('test_parentheses', meta,\n    Column('CT Volume (cc)', Integer) #, key='foob')\n)\nmeta.create_all()\n\ni = table.insert()\ni.execute({'CT Volume (cc)': 1})\n\nprint engine.execute(table.select().where(table.c['CT Volume (cc)'] == 5))\n```\n\n\nor, the compiler could escape bound parameter names that are obviously in conflict with %(pyformat)s style, and that would just be a convention, any \"%\" or \"()\" character needs to be an underscore, or something like that.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441926776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441926777","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3245#issuecomment-441926777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3245","id":441926777,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyNjc3Nw==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-10T23:02:34Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:39:20Z","body":"**Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\n- The :attr:`.Column.key` attribute is now used as the source of\nanonymous bound parameter names within expressions, to match the\nexisting use of this value as the key when rendered in an INSERT\nor UPDATE statement.

am trying to build an ORM over existing database (which I have no architectural influence over). I am running into an issue where some of the column names have a \"-\" in their name. In short, this syntax is carried over into the bound parameter where it causes issues.\r\n\r\nThis trimmed down example outlines this issue:\r\n```py\r\nclass Person(Base):\r\n    __tablename__=\"persontable\"\r\n    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(name=\"id\", primary_key=True)\r\n    first_name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(name=\"first-name\")\r\n```\r\nNote how the column name in the table has a dash in it.\r\nNow, if I build a query that would parametize this value and run it:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nstmt = select(Person).where(Person.first_name==\"John\")\r\n# print(stmt):\r\n# SELECT persontable.`id`, persontable.`first-name` FROM persontable WHERE persontable.`first-name` = :first-name_1\r\n\r\nwith Session.session() as session:\r\n   johns = session.scalars(stmt)\r\n```\r\nAn error is raised\r\n`sqlalchemy.exc.DatabaseError: (databricks.sql.exc.ServerOperationError) [UNBOUND_SQL_PARAMETER] Found the unbound parameter: first`. \r\nThe way I see it is that `:first-name_1` is not taken as is, but the `-` is interpreted as a subtraction operator.\r\n\r\nI assume this is an oversight in implementing the dialect. I am hoping someone could assist with a workaround or implement a solution. Please note that renaming the column on the table directly is not an option for me.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/databricks/databricks-sql-python/issues/368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/databricks/databricks-sql-python/issues/368/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
