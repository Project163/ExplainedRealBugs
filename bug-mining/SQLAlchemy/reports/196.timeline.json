The try/except should be removed.\n\nFor the case where you really want to be able to affect this, I'd prefer an explicit option `create_engine(..., count_matched_rows=True)` that works equally for mysqldb, mysqlconnector, oursql, and the others (or raises a NotImplementedError for a DBAPI that doesn't provide for it).
