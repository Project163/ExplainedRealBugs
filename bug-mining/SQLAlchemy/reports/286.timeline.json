the big offenders in PyPy. _expire is called ~1400x per modified tank object in PyPy compared with only once per object in Python. Any idea what's up with this?\n\nI hope this provides some better insight. PyPy appears to make up some long time further on, so it's not as bad as I was seeing in my real app (2-3x slower), which requires further investigation.

This seems like it might be a stumbling block for anyone using SQLAlchemy with PyPy. Luckily for me, I don't want to expire_on_commit in this application.\n\nPyPy now beats cPython... eventually. PyPy is 2x slower at 1000 iterations, catches up at 7000 iterations, and is 2x faster by 30000 iterations. Unfortunately, my real app presumably doesn't execute this code enough times for PyPy's JIT to master it, hence appearing 2x slower. I guess I over-estimated the JIT since it's optimized other code I've benchmarked in far less iterations.\n\nI am very interested in benchmarking BakedQuery to see how caching the queries would help. However, I think I'll have to wait for documentation before I can figure out how to use it. I will try to benchmark it once it's in the master branch.
