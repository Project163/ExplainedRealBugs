issue, originally created by Anonymous**\n\n(original reporter: jonathan) The FAQ on logging \n\n     http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_8/faq.html?highlight=logging#how-do-i-configure-logging\n\nsent me to the Engine logging docs:\n\n       http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_8/core/engines.html#dbengine-logging\n\nI wanted to suggest this addition to the docs :\n\n-------\n\nSometimes you might want to disable existing query logging for certain \nstatements, such as when you are inserting a BLOB or large TEXT value.\n\nAn easy way to accomplish this is to wrap your query in a pair of statements\nthat toggle the `disabled` attribute of the logger.\n\nIn the example below, note that the logger needed to disable already-enabled\nquery logging is `sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine` , and not the \n`sqlalchemy.engine` logger  mentioned above.\n\n    import logging\n    logging.getLogger('sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine').disabled = True\n    ... execute query ...\n    logging.getLogger('sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine').disabled = False
