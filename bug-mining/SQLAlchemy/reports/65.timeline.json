Couple points:\n\no Do we need the scope_identity change in base? (I’m not that familiar with the mssql dialects but I know that’s been True for a long time now, and Mike’s on vacation)\n\no What do you think of having the url use the normal spots for the user/password args i.e. create_engine(‘mssql+zxjdbc://user:password@hostname’). And also converting any extra query args automatically to jdbc options (since they both come in and go out as string values). I did this for the default zxjdbc connect args recently, but jtds would needs its own version for its ; delimiter.
