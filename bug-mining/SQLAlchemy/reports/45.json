issue, originally created by Anonymous**\n\nSince 0.5.0 (it worked in 0.5.0rc4) the new types system of MSSQL dialect has introduced a new _StringType that does not implement the unicode convertion in the result processor.\n\nThis means that the result data for Text columns are not converted to unicode objects anymore.\n\nPlease find attached a patch that fixes this.\n\nI would like to add a unit test to this (I have a mssql test env setup) but unfortunately I don't know where to pass the convert_unicode flag to the mssql engine to test this.\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [mssql_string_type_rm_result_processor.patch](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/1291/mssql_string_type_rm_result_processor.patch) |
