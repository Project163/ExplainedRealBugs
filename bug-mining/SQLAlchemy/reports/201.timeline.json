strange SQL (`widget.type IN (:type_1)` should be in the subquery):\n```sql\nSELECT EXISTS (SELECT * \nFROM widget \nWHERE widget.related_id = :related_id_1 AND widget.id = :id_1) AS anon_1 \nFROM

EXISTS (SELECT 1 \nFROM widget \nWHERE widget.related_id = :related_id_1 AND widget.id = :id_1 AND widget.type IN (:type_1)) AS anon_1 \nFROM widget \nWHERE widget.type IN (:type_1)\n```\n(note the repeating `widget.type IN (:type_1)` clause)\n\n\nNot sure if this is a bug or I'm just using it wrong, but I figured I'd create an issue. Sorry for the hassle if it's not a bug.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
