This is a non-standard, undocumented marker, which the [packaging](https://github.com/pypa/packaging/issues/72) library used by pip has inherited from setuptools, but which alternative installers might not support. [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) does not support this marker. Please consider using `platform_python_implementation` or `implementation_name` instead.
