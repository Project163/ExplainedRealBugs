(e.g., \"videos\" below) fields of transient/detached objects automatically load empty lists as values after they've been accessed. As shown in the example below, an unbound user object gets created. The first set of asserts show that none of the fields have values loaded, except for `first_name`. After we access the fields through print statements, the last test fails because `mapper.attrs.videos.loaded_value == []`. I would expect videos' value to remain unloaded after the print statement. \r\n\r\nThis could lead to problems… for example, if you access a transient object's 1-to-many field, merge the object (using session.merge(obj)) and commit,  the existing relationship values, if exist, gets replaced with an empty list, thus removes the children.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_sqlalchemy_loaded_relationships():\r\n    import sqlalchemy as sa\r\n    from sqlalchemy.orm.base import NO_VALUE\r\n    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\r\n    Base = declarative_base()\r\n\r\n    class User(Base):\r\n        __tablename__ = 'user'\r\n\r\n        id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, primary_key=True)\r\n        first_name = sa.Column(sa.Text)\r\n        last_name = sa.Column(sa.Text)\r\n        profile = sa.orm.relationship(\r\n            'Profile',\r\n            uselist=False,\r\n            single_parent=True,\r\n            cascade='all, delete-orphan',\r\n        )\r\n        videos = sa.orm.relationship(\r\n            'Video',\r\n            cascade='all, delete-orphan',\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    class Profile(Base):\r\n        __tablename__ = 'profile'\r\n\r\n        id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, primary_key=True)\r\n        phone_number = sa.Column(sa.Text)\r\n        user_id = sa.Column(\r\n            sa.dialects.postgresql.UUID(as_uuid=True),\r\n            sa.ForeignKey('user.id', name='fk_profile_user_id'),\r\n            nullable=False,\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    class Video(Base):\r\n        __tablename__ = 'video'\r\n\r\n        id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, primary_key=True)\r\n        name = sa.Column(sa.Text)\r\n        url = sa.Column(sa.Text)\r\n        user_id = sa.Column(\r\n            sa.dialects.postgresql.UUID(as_uuid=True),\r\n            sa.ForeignKey('user.id', name='fk_video_user_id'),\r\n            nullable=False,\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    john = User(first_name='John')\r\n\r\n    #
