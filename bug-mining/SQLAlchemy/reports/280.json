issue, originally created by Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek))**\n\nthe logic commented out below has the effect that if a \"local\" column appears more than once in the clause, it only gets turned to a bound param once.  need to determine the rationale for this logic and get it to be more specific to the case where it is needed.\n\n```\ndiff --git
