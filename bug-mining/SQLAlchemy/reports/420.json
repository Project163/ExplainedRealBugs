issue, originally created by Yegor Roganov ([@roganov](https://github.com/roganov))**\n\nGiven class hierarchy from http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/changelog/migration_10.html\n```python\nclass Widget(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'widget'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    type = Column(String)\n    related_id = Column(ForeignKey('related.id'))\n    related = relationship(\"Related\", backref=\"widget\")\n    __mapper_args__ = {'polymorphic_on': type}\n\n\nclass FooWidget(Widget):\n    __mapper_args__ = {'polymorphic_identity': 'foo'}\n\n\nclass Related(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'related'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n``` \nquery \n`session.query(exists().where(and_(FooWidget.related_id == 5, FooWidget.id == 6)))`\nproduces strange SQL (`widget.type IN (:type_1)` should be in the subquery):\n```sql\nSELECT EXISTS (SELECT * \nFROM widget \nWHERE widget.related_id = :related_id_1 AND widget.id = :id_1) AS anon_1 \nFROM widget \nWHERE widget.type IN (:type_1)\n```\nQuery `session.query(session.query(FooWidget).filter(and_(FooWidget.related_id == 5, FooWidget.id == 6)).exists())` is also suboptimal:\n```sql\nSELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 \nFROM widget \nWHERE widget.related_id = :related_id_1 AND widget.id = :id_1 AND widget.type IN (:type_1)) AS anon_1 \nFROM widget \nWHERE widget.type IN (:type_1)\n```\n(note the repeating `widget.type IN (:type_1)` clause)\n\n\nNot sure if this is a bug or I'm just using it wrong, but I figured I'd create an issue. Sorry for the hassle if it's not a bug.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
