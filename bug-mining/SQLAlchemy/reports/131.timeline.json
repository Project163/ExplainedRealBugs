do not support these values being placed as bound parameters and assume these values are integers safe to copy directly into SQL (see Sybase) so that function must be present.\n\nI think to maintain maximum compatibility and zero chance of security issues on 3rd party dialects, as well as to allow for clear error reporting for non-upgraded dialects, ._limit and ._offset should always be guaranteed integers or else it raises an exception on access (e.g. \"this select has a SQL-composed limit/offset expression\").      these accessors can actually look at self._limit_clause.effective_value, assuming the value is a BindParamClause.\n\nNew attributes _limit_clause and _offset_clause will store the actual SQL clause that is to be compiled into the
