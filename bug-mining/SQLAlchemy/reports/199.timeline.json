issue, originally created by Hanno Schlichting ([@hannosch](https://github.com/hannosch))**\n\nGot a Sentry report from a live site today, using SQLAlchemy 1.0.6, PyMySQL 0.6.3 against a Amazon RDS MySQL 5.6 instance.\n\nThis happened just once, in a code path that is frequently executed, so it must be some kind of weird state it got in, though I don't know what state that is.\n\nLooking through the issue tracker, this might be related to a new 1.0 feature via issue #3175.\n\nFull traceback:\n\n```\nStacktrace (most recent call last):\n\n  <removed app code specific stack frames>\n\n  File \"sqlalchemy/orm/query.py\", line 2445, in first\n    ret = list(self[0:1])\n  File \"sqlalchemy/orm/query.py\", line 2281, in __getitem__\n    return list(res)\n  File \"sqlalchemy/orm/loading.py\", line 84, in instances\n    util.raise_from_cause(err)\n  File \"sqlalchemy/util/compat.py\", line 199, in raise_from_cause\n    reraise(type(exception), exception, tb=exc_tb)\n  File \"sqlalchemy/orm/loading.py\", line 51, in instances\n    for query_entity in query._entities\n  File \"sqlalchemy/orm/query.py\", line 3312, in row_processor\n    polymorphic_discriminator=self._polymorphic_discriminator\n  File \"sqlalchemy/orm/loading.py\", line 313, in _instance_processor\n    getter = result._getter(col)\n  File \"sqlalchemy/engine/result.py\", line 495, in _getter\n    return self._metadata._getter(key)\n\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '_getter'\n```\n\nThe query going into this is a simple:\n```\nsession.query(SomeModel).filter(SomeModel.pk_column == 'somevalue')\n.first()\n```\n\nIn the last stackframe, the locals are:\n```\nkey = Column('some_column', INTEGER(), table=<some_table>)\nself = <sqlalchemy.engine.result.ResultProxy object at 0x4aa7e50>\n```\n\nIt looks to me like `ResultProxy._metadata` ends up being `None`, even after `_init_metadata` is called. I see a bunch of `if self._metadata is None` cases in the other functions, so maybe this just needs one of those protections as well.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
