issue, originally created by Anonymous**\n\nUsing [2693](2693) some delete operations fail with a `sqlalchemy.exceptions.ConcurrentModificationError: Updated rowcount 3 does not match number of objects updated 3  ` triggered at `Module sqlalchemy.orm.mapper:1296 in delete_obj`.\n\nProbably due a typo since the check which triggers the exception looks at `c.rowcount }} while the message looks at `c.cursor.rowcount` (hence the exception always says \"x doesn't match x\")\n\nThe attached path fixes it.\n\nAlberto\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments:
