issue, originally created by zoomorph ([@zoomorph](https://github.com/zoomorph))**\n\nListening for changes to a scalar attribute can be done via the 'set' event:\n```\ndef validate_phone(target, value, oldvalue, initiator):\n    \"\"\"Strip non-numeric characters from a phone number\"\"\"\n\n    return re.sub(r'(?![0-9])', '', value)\n\n# setup listener on UserContact.phone attribute, instructing\n# it to use the return value\nlisten(UserContact.phone, 'set', validate_phone, retval=True)\n```\n\nWhen Mutable attributes are set, they also emit the 'set' event. However, they do not emit any events when they are merely changed.\n\nA new event such as 'changed' should be added to cover this case. It would work like so:\n```\ndef favorites_changed(target, value, oldvalue, initiator):\n    logger.info(\"Favorites was set or changed\")\n    # do something\n\n# setup listeners on UserContact.favorites attribute (a MutableList for example)\nlisten(UserContact.favorites, 'set', favorites_changed)\nlisten(UserContact.favorites, 'changed', favorites_changed)\n\nu = session.query(UserContact).first()\nu.favorites = [1, 2, 3]  # emits 'set'\nu.favorites.append(4)  # should emit 'changed'\nu.favorites[-1] = 5  # should emit 'changed'\n```\n\nRelated to issue #3297\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3303/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
