given query without having to make up a string like query.bake(\"myquery\").\n\nif you do have a baked query, and you then call an operation like filter() or something, that would basically give you an un-baked query.  so it's still \"safe\" but probably not what one wants.   here, in any case, there's some kind of a \"bake\" object that would only have methods that apply to a pre-baked

Or structure the code differently.\n\nWe use this pattern a lot in our code - maybe others do not.  But we typically have a few variations of a query based on some dynamic condition so a line number based cache key wouldn't help us.

While it allows you to build up a Query as we normally do, it is nuts, scary, and doesn't work consistently, so not sure that's really the best way to go.  \n\nThe next one is just less than pleasing day to day, you have to use lambdas to build up the query.

Interesting.  I guess that does catch the conditionals for the most part (maybe single-line conditionals could trick the system but whatever, probably not common).\n\nPassing a new lambda for each condition does look a bit painful - perhaps you could have one lambda or procedure that accepts a list of booleans and use the whole argument list as part of the cache key?\n\nSo something like \n\n```\ndef make_query(filter_, join, order_by)\n   q = sess.query(A)\n   if filter_: q = q.filter(...)\n   if join: q = q.join(...)\n   if order_by: q = q.order_by(...)\n   return q\n\nbaked = BakedQuery(make_query)\n```\n\nUsing BakedQuery as decorator would work here, too. I think using just one lambda and passing in the flags seems less painful to me, especially because lambdas are so restrictive in python compared to named functions.\n\nBut then, once you start down this road you can require it to be a named global function and you don't need to use the function file and line as the cache key any more, just store the cache in the BakedQuery itself because there would be just one instance of this per logical query.\n\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441923682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441923683","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3054#issuecomment-441923683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3054","id":441923683,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyMzY4Mw==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-05-20T22:12:31Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:30:56Z","body":"**Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\nyes, the recipe as is (in the third example) works almost that way, i think it's kind of like the recipe you provided.
