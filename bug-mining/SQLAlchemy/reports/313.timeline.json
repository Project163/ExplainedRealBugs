But it's not, they've been out for a few years now.   So the chance that applications are silently relying on this without issues at the moment is high.   That's why we use warnings when we find things like this that have been out in the wild for a long time.

So it's a bug for sure but when I spring new errors on people, it really very often produces lots more headaches for everyone.   For backwards compatibility on behaviors that may be silently succeeding for people, we use a warning.\n\n> I ran into issues in production code where we accidentally updated every single row in a table because of this. \n\nI'm sorry for that, but the truth is there's lots of ways you can write an UPDATE statement that produces an unexpected syntax, not to mention encounter unexpected behaviors with the unit of work, the database, and everything else, and you should be unit and functional testing your code to ensure it works as expected.  The echo=True option is extremely prominent in SQLAlchemy as well in order to encourage the developer to be very aware of how the application is acting at the level of SQL interaction.   At least when putting code into production, it is reasonable to expect that the developers have observed the warnings that their code produces beforehand and I think if this warning were there, you would have seen it.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441928214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441928215","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3349#issuecomment-441928215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3349","id":441928215,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyODIxNQ==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-01T17:54:21Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:43:30Z","body":"**Saif Hakim ([@saifelse](https://github.com/saifelse)) wrote:**\n\n> because the FROM clause isn't what's considered there as a \"select modifier\".

Fortunately, the data was entirely recoverable. As a sanity check, is there a nice way to configure SQLAlchemy to log a warning -- maybe even raise an error -- if an update/delete touches more than say, 10000
