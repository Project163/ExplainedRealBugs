issue, originally created by Mathieu Rodic**\n\nMySQL came up with an implementation of the JSON type : [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/json.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/json.html)\n\nIt would be nice to have it available in `sqlalchemy.dialects.mysql`, in the same way its PostgreSQL counterpart can be imported from `sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql`.\n\nI wouldn't mind working on the implementation, if given the required elements (some exceptions are poorly documented, e.g.: `sqlalchemy.exc.CompileError: (in table 'entities', column 'data'): Compiler <sqlalchemy.dialects.mysql.base.MySQLTypeCompiler object at 0x7f1fcd4a0d10> can't render element of type <class
