issue, originally created by charles pierre ([@cp2587](https://github.com/cp2587))**\n\nHi, \nI am trying to work to setup a multi-schema environnement with sqlalchemy and postgres but i am struggling for two reasons :\n\n1. It seems that you cannot change dynamically the schema (i did metadata.schema = 'new_schema' and looped over all tables to also do table.schema = 'new_schema' but it feels like a hack). Does the library have a function to do this properly ?\n\n2. Some object does not inherit the schema option from the table or metadata. An example would be the postgresql enum type. How do you control in which schema the type gets created ? \n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3207/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
