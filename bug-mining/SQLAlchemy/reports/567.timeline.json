Describe the bug\r\nWhen using PostgreSQL as the database for Langflow version 0.6, an error occurs during the DB migration process. Despite the log suggesting to run `langflow migration --fix`, executing this command does not resolve the error.\r\n\r\n### Browser and Version\r\n - Google Chrome: Version 121.0.6167.160 (Official Build) (arm64)\r\n - Langflow: v0.6.6\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Construct the environment using the attached `compose.yaml` and `Dockerfile`.\r\n2. Run the command `docker compose up`.\r\n3. Observe the startup error log.\r\n4.
