issue, originally created by Giorgos Georgiou ([@behos](https://github.com/behos))**\n\nI am getting an assertion error when rolling back a transaction following an OperationalError raised by a deadlock within a nested transaction:\n\nFile \"lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/session.py\", line 273, in _restore_snapshot\n    assert self._is_transaction_boundary\n\nI assume that this is caused by another error that was raised during the deadlock rollback attempt:\n\nsqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (_mysql_exceptions.OperationalError) (1305, 'SAVEPOINT sa_savepoint_1 does not exist') [SQL: u'ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT sa_savepoint_1']\n\nThis was executed automatically after the deadlock error.\n\nWhen the session reaches this point, I cannot roll it back and can only re-use it by using session.close()\n\nTo reproduce:\n\n\n```\nclass MyTable(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'mytable'\n\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True, nullable=False)\n    name = Column(String(10), unique=True, nullable=False)\n\n```\n\nIn session 1:\n\n\n```\ns = Session()\ns.begin_nested()\ns.add(MyTable(name='mitsos'))\ns.flush()\n\n```\n\nIn session 2:\n\n\n```\ns = Session()\ns.begin_nested()\ns.add(MyTable(name='mitsos'))\ns.flush()\n\n```\n\nBack to session 1:\n\n\n```\ns.add(MyTable(name='mits'))\ns.flush()\n\n```\n\nAt this point session 2 will get the deadlock stacktrace and a failed rollback attempt because of the savepoint error.\n\nAfter this, the session cannot be rolled back at all.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3680/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
