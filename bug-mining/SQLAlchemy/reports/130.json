issue, originally created by Anonymous**\n\nHi.\n\nWhen I work with SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL I find interesting and unobvious nuance:\n\nWhen using item of array in filter or order_by there are need to use indexes starts from 1 (there are no index 0 in pestgres ARRAY)\nBut, for getting value or values and use it there are need to use indexes starts from zero.\n\n\nMay be would be better change logic of __getitem__ method of sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql.ARRAY for use one standart of indexes in all situations.\n\nRegards,\nAlexey
