It's a really old rule so it takes place in a very crude way, but the core of it is that SQL Server, at least the 2005/2008 versions, cannot handle a query as follows:\n\n\n```\nSELECT [schema].t2.a, [schema].t2.b, [schema].t2.c, (SELECT a1.a FROM [schema].t2 AS a1) AS anon_1 FROM [schema].t2\n```\n\nthe thing here that's pushing in that alias name is turning the above query into:\n\n\n```\nSELECT t2_1.a, t2_1.b, t2_1.c, \n(SELECT a1.a FROM [schema].t2 AS a1) \nAS anon_1 FROM [schema].t2 AS t2_1\n\n```\n\nthe idea is that by making an alias \"t2_1\", the \"[schema].t2\" token isn't everywhere because it is observed that SQL Server disallows this syntax in many areas (or at least it did).\n\nin this case, if we turn the logic off entirely, just as a hack:\n\n\n```\ndiff --git a/lib/sqlalchemy/dialects/mssql/base.py b/lib/sqlalchemy/dialects/mssql/base.py\nindex b073af6..c029fb7 100644\n--- a/lib/sqlalchemy/dialects/mssql/base.py\n+++ b/lib/sqlalchemy/dialects/mssql/base.py\n@@ -1055,6 +1055,7 @@ class MSSQLCompiler(compiler.SQLCompiler):\n             return compiler.SQLCompiler.visit_select(self, select, **kwargs)\n \n     def _schema_aliased_table(self, table):\n+        raise NotImplementedError()\n         if getattr(table, 'schema', None) is not None:\n             if table not in self.tablealiases:\n                 self.tablealiases[table] = table.alias()\n@@ -1063,7 +1064,7 @@ class MSSQLCompiler(compiler.SQLCompiler):\n             return None\n \n     def visit_table(self, table, mssql_aliased=False, iscrud=False, **kwargs):\n-        if mssql_aliased is table or iscrud:\n+        if True: #mssql_aliased is table or iscrud:\n             return super(MSSQLCompiler, self).visit_table(table, **kwargs)\n \n         # alias schema-qualified tables\n@@ -1092,9 +1093,9 @@ class MSSQLCompiler(compiler.SQLCompiler):\n                 % self.preparer.format_savepoint(savepoint_stmt))\n \n     def visit_column(self, column, add_to_result_map=None, **kwargs):\n-        if column.table is not None and \\\n-                (not self.isupdate and not self.isdelete) or \\\n-                self.is_subquery():\n+        if False:# and column.table is not None and \\\n+                #(not self.isupdate and not self.isdelete) or \\\n+                #self.is_subquery():\n             # translate for schema-qualified table aliases\n             t = self._schema_aliased_table(column.table)\n             if t is not None:\n\n```\n\nyour statements come out like this:\n\n\n```\nUPDATE [schema].sometable SET val=(SELECT [#other].newval \nFROM [#other] \nWHERE [schema].sometable.sym = [#other].sym)\n\nUPDATE [schema].sometable SET val=[#other].newval FROM [schema].sometable, [#other] WHERE [schema].sometable.sym = [#other].sym\n\n```\n\nfirst thing you can do to help.
