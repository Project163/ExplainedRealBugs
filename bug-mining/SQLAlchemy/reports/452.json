The attached patch illustrates a new system that provides for individual plugins specified as query string parameters, staying away from the driver portion of the URL that systems like Openstack rely heavily on.  It also provides stateful hooks so that the URL format and kwargs can both be fully extracted and applied to the engine after its constructed, fixing the awkwardness of the dialect system that calls upon class-level hooks.\n\nThe 1.0.3 system is just two method calls which are of little use compared to this newer system, they should be marked deprecated.\n\ntagging this at 1.1 but it may be very useful to have this in 1.0.9.\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [3536.patch](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/3536/3536.patch)\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3536/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
