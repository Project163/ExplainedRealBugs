Adding `configure_mappers()` before doing the create resolves:\n\n\n```\nconfigure_mappers()\n\nengine = create_engine('sqlite://', echo=True)\nBase.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)\n\n```\n\nNow the issue of configure_mappers() sometimes needing to be called is an ongoing issue.   However, here is the thing - the test case here behaves the same on 0.9.9; without a configure step (or a call like User() that will configure the mappers), I get the same behavior, e.g.:\n\n\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE recipients (\n\tid INTEGER NOT NULL, \n\tPRIMARY KEY (id)\n)\n\n```\n\nand not:\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE recipients (\n\tid INTEGER NOT NULL, \n\tusers_id INTEGER, \n\tmessages_id INTEGER, \n\tPRIMARY KEY (id), \n\tFOREIGN KEY(users_id) REFERENCES users (id), \n\tFOREIGN KEY(messages_id) REFERENCES messages (id)\n)\n\n```\n\nso that would mean this particular
