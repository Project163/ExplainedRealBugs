stuff for model, id as primary key etc>\n    purchase_uuid = db.Column(postgresql.UUID(as_uuid=True), default=uuid.uuid4)\n\n    __mapper_args__ = {\n        'version_id_col': purchase_uuid,\n        'version_id_generator': False\n    }\n```\nthis works fine i.e. we can block a certain `UPDATES` unless purchase_uuid is being updated (taken from http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/versioning.html#programmatic-or-conditional-version-counters )\n\nWe also have another model\n\n```\nclass Session(BaseModel):\n    <snip -
