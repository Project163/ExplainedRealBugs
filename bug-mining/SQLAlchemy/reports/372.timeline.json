issue, originally created by inklesspen ([@inklesspen](https://github.com/inklesspen))**\n\nI'm looking at using the ORM's version counting system, but I've found a corner case that makes it difficult.\n\nIn the below example, I make a change to node1 to set its related node to node2 (previously None). Conceptually, this is a change to node1, and node1 shows up in session.dirty (node2 does not); however, due to the way the foreign key is implemented, SQLAlchemy needs to UPDATE the foreign key on node2's row.\n\nThis means that the updated_at column gets updated for node2, not node1. However, strangely, the revision counter doesn't increment for either object; the generated SQL is \"UPDATE nodes SET related_node_id=1, updated_at=CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE nodes.id = 2\"\n\nI think this may be a bug. The unwanted behavior does not occur if I also mutate the bonus_data column on node1. (However, updated_at still gets updated on node2, which is technically not accurate but is acceptable for my use case.)\n\n\n```\nimport logging\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, relationship\n\nlogging.basicConfig()\nlogging.getLogger('sqlalchemy.engine').setLevel(logging.INFO)\n\nengine = sa.create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n\nclass Node(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'nodes'\n\n    id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    related_node_id = sa.Column(sa.Integer, sa.ForeignKey('nodes.id'))\n    updated_at = sa.Column(sa.DateTime, default=sa.func.now(), onupdate=sa.func.now())\n    revision = sa.Column(sa.Integer)\n    bonus_data = sa.Column(sa.Unicode(20))\n\n    related_node = relationship('Node', uselist=False, post_update=True)\n\n    __mapper_args__ = {\n        \"version_id_col\": revision\n    }\n\n\nBase.metadata.create_all(engine)\n\nsession_factory = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n\nsession = session_factory()\nnode1 = Node()\nnode2 = Node()\nsession.add(node1)\nsession.add(node2)\nsession.flush()\nnode1_id = node1.id\nnode2_id = node2.id\nsession.commit()\n\nnode1 = session.query(Node).get(node1_id)\nnode2 = session.query(Node).get(node2_id)\nassert node1.revision == 1\nassert node2.revision == 1\nnode1.bonus_data = u'hello'\nnode2.bonus_data = u'world'\nsession.commit()\n\nnode1 = session.query(Node).get(node1_id)\nnode2 = session.query(Node).get(node2_id)\nassert node1.revision == 2\nassert node2.revision == 2\nassert node1.updated_at == node2.updated_at\n\nnode1.related_node = node2\nassert node1 in session.dirty\nassert session.is_modified(node1)\nassert node2 not in session.dirty\nassert not session.is_modified(node2)\n# node1.bonus_data = u\"goodbye\"\nsession.flush()\nassert node1.revision == 3\nassert node2.revision == 2\nsession.commit()\n\n```\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [3496.patch](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/3496/3496.patch)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3496/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
