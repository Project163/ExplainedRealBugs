issue, originally created by Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek))**\n\npoc should allow us to consolidate #2670, #2952, #3149, #3050.\n\nthe new descriptors include the ability to cache the result per class, or to do \"cascade\", guarantees that the callable fn is called only once per target class, as well as to name attributes that are set up after the mapping is complete, so that relationship and column_property declared_attrs have the whole mapping to work with when they are called.  and the whole thing doesn't modify any existing functionality, only adds new things we can take time to stabilize.  win win win win.\n\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import *\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import *\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base, declared_attr,
