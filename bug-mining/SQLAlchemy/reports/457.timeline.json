columns passed to the method to be positionally matched with the\nresult columns in the statement, rather than matching on name alone.\nThe advantage to this includes that when linking a textual SQL statement\nto an ORM or Core table model, no system of labeling or de-duping of\ncommon column names needs to occur, which also means there's no need\nto worry about how label names match to ORM columns and so-forth.  In\naddition, the :class:`.ResultProxy` has been further enhanced to\nmap column and string keys to a row with greater precision in some\ncases.  fixes #3501\n- reorganize the initialization of ResultMetaData for readability\nand complexity; use the name \"cursor_description\", define the\ntask of \"merging\" cursor_description with compiled column information\nas its own function, and also define \"name extraction\" as a separate task.\n- fully change the name we use in the \"ambiguous column\" error to be the\nactual name that was ambiguous, modify the C ext also\n\n\n→
