issue, originally created by Dmytro Starosud ([@dima-starosud](https://github.com/dima-starosud))**\n\nThis is using SQLAlchemy==1.2.14.\nPlease consider following code snippet:\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, create_engine\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Load, Query\nfrom sqlalchemy.pool import NullPool\n\nengine = create_engine('postgresql://***', poolclass=NullPool)\nconnection = engine.connect()\nconnection.begin_nested()\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n\nclass MyEntity(Base):\n

following output:\n\n\n```\n<class '__main__.MyEntity'>\nSELECT my_entity.id AS my_entity_id, my_entity.a AS my_entity_a, my_entity.kind AS my_entity_kind\nFROM my_entity\n<class

Did I misread documentation? Note unbound `load_only('a')` works
