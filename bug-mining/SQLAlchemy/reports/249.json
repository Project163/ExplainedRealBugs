This collection should either not be there at all, or just changed to be a ColumnCollection.   Hitting it will just invoke the FK.  Some other accessor should be added that gives us the column names in the absense of the FK constraint actually being set up.\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import Integer, Column, Table, MetaData, \\\n    ForeignKeyConstraint, ForeignKey\n\nm = MetaData()\n\nt1 = Table(\n    't1', m,\n    Column('x', Integer, primary_key=True)\n)\n\nt2 = Table(\n    't2', m,\n    Column('y', Integer, primary_key=True),\n    Column('z1', Integer, ForeignKey('t1.x')),\n    Column('z2', Integer)\n)\n\nfk1 = [\n    const for const in t2.constraints\n    if isinstance(const, ForeignKeyConstraint)][0]\nfk2 = ForeignKeyConstraint(['z2'], ['t1.x'])\n\n# keys are Column objects, OK\nassert isinstance(fk1.columns[0], Column)\n\n# WAT\nassert isinstance(fk2.columns[0], str)\nt2.append_constraint(fk2)\n\n# WAT\nassert isinstance(fk2.columns[0], str)\n\n\n```\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
