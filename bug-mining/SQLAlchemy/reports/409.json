issue, originally created by Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek))**\n\ntype_coerce makes its decision about the thing it is processing when created.  if a bindparam, the type is changed.  otherwise, a label() is produced.  \n\nHowever this fails for this :\n\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import *\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import *\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n\nclass CastToIntegerType(TypeDecorator):\n    impl = String\n\n    def column_expression(self, col):\n        return cast(col, Integer)\n\n    def bind_expression(self,col):\n        return cast(col, String)\n\nclass Person(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'person'\n    id = Column('id_string', CastToIntegerType, primary_key=True)\n\n    pets = relationship('Pets',\n        primaryjoin='foreign(Pets.person_id)==type_coerce(Person.id, Integer)')\n\nclass Pets(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'pets'\n    id = Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True)\n    person_id = Column('person_id', Integer, ForeignKey('person.id_string'), primary_key=True)\n\n\ne = create_engine(\"sqlite://\", echo=True)\nBase.metadata.create_all(e)\n\ns = Session(e)\ns.add_all([Person(id=\"5\", pets=[Pets(id=\"1\")])])\ns.commit()\n\np1 = s.query(Person).first()\np1.pets\n\n```\n\nbecause we are creating bindparam after the fact - there's no actual TypeCoerce construct here so when we see that Label, we don't know anything that there was a type coerce.  We'd need to build some new construct.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3531/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
