We try to keep PRs under 500 lines of code.\r\n* Draft PRs are a good way to get early feedback on designs or several incremental commits that will add up to larger changes. If you want a review of a draft PR, make sure you contact the reviewer directly or mention their username in the PR comment, so they get a notification.\r\n* How quickly we can review a PR will depend on how large and complex it is, and how busy we are, but ideally we strive to get an initial review done within a week. If there are going to be delays, we should at least comment on the PR to let you know the situation.\r\n* If you believe you've addressed a reviewer's comments, respond with a brief note and mark the comment resolved. If further discussion is requried respond and do not resolve the comment.\r\n* Before a PR is merged all reviewer comments should be resolved. If a reviewer doesn't feel that their comment has been sufficiently addressed, they may unresolve a comment.\r\n* Be careful not to accidentally \"start a review\" when responding to comments! If this does happen, don't forget to submit the review you've started so the other PR participatns can see your comments (they are invisible to others if marked \"Pending\").\r\n* In the period after an initial review when there is significant back-and-forth with the reviewer deciding what changes should actually be made, there should probably be daily interaction. If significant changes are required, it's usually best to request another review after those changes have been made.\r\n\r\nFeel free to delete the commented-out parts of the template before submitting the PR.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# PR Overview\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nInclude a short narrative summary of what's going on in the PR.

Background\r\nSQLite[ uses an autoincrement function ](https://www.sqlite.org/autoinc.html) to fill in missing values when a table has a non composite integer primary key. Luckily we only have a few tables that fall into this category and missing values are handled during the transformation steps. See this [PR convo](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/pull/2410/files#r1140471930) for additional context.\r\n\r\n> On an [INSERT](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_insert.html), if the ROWID or INTEGER PRIMARY KEY column is not explicitly given a value, then it will be filled automatically with an unused integer, usually one more than the largest ROWID currently in use. This is true regardless of whether or not the AUTOINCREMENT keyword is used.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this behavior, SQLite recommends using [`WITHOUT ROWID` phrase](https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html):\r\n\r\n> The special behaviors associated \"[INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html#rowid)\" do not apply on WITHOUT ROWID tables. In an ordinary table, \"INTEGER PRIMARY KEY\" means that the column is an alias for the rowid. But since there is no rowid in a WITHOUT ROWID table, that special meaning no longer applies. An \"INTEGER PRIMARY KEY\" column in a WITHOUT ROWID table works like an \"INT PRIMARY KEY\" column in an ordinary table: It is a PRIMARY KEY that has integer [affinity](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#affinity).\r\n\r\n[SQLite has a parameter](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/dialects/sqlite.html#sqlite-specific-table-options) for controlling this behavior... great!\r\n\r\nNot great. As the quote above says, an Integer Primary Key in a table using the WITHOUT ROWID becomes a INT PRIMARY KEY that has *integer affinity*.[ From what I can tell sqlite won't throw an error if a string that can't be cast to int is loaded to the db.](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#affinity) I was able to load `\"abc\"` value into an \"INTEGER PRIMARY KEY\" column using WITHOUT ROWID.\r\n\r\nSQLite offers a [STRICT phrase](https://www.sqlite.org/stricttables.html) that might restrict the type affinity rules but[ sqlalchemy doesn't support it yet.](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/7398)\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\n- Add some logic to the SQLiteIOManager that does some checks on primary keys in pandas.\r\n- Start using [dagster-pandera](https://docs.dagster.io/integrations/pandera) to do some integrity constraints on dataframes before they are loaded to the db.\r\n- Research tools that can apply integrity constraints to any type of database so we don't have do integrity check in pandas or create custom test suites for different backends.

It's based on @FynnFreyer's solution, but it should in theory be more robust (since we don't recompute the sql statement for creating the table, and I check for a few more potential errors). And it works for non-ORM use cases.\r\n\r\nCaveats (some of which also applies to @FynnFreyer's solution):\r\n* WILL delete your indexes.\r\n* For types you use that aren't [supported by SQLite strict tables](https://www.sqlite.org/stricttables.html), you need to [override their compilation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/custom_types.html#overriding-type-compilation) so they get compiled into a supported SQLite type.\r\n* Requires that you already have a schema of all the tables you want to make strict.\r\n* Untested with ORM, but replacing the redefine method in @FynnFreyer's solution with my `recreate_table_as_strict` should work.\r\n* Untested with non-default SQLite databases (e.g. a table named `my_db.my_table`).\r\n* Use for whatever you want but at your own
