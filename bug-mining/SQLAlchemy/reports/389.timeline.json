make this work you'd ideally be using ``str(type.compile(dialect=myengine.dialect))``, which is definitely necessary if your types happen to be instances of VARBINARY, IMAGE, or NTEXT that are SQL-server only.  However, in this case the \"length\" parameter of the base string types is expected to be an integer or None, where None represents \"unlengthed\", so having \"max\" there is not really appropriate. \n\nI think part of what happens here is that there was a difference between None and \"max\", which we've changed a bit as a result of #3039, but I'm not sure if we took this into account within reflection in any case. I can see that *maybe* if one has \"deprecate_large_types\" set to False and they do a reflection of TEXT(), they'd expect a difference between \"None\" and \"max\", I'm not sure.   I don't think it's going to cause an issue but if it does, we'll be back
