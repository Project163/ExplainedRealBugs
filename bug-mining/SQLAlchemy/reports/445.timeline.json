issue, originally created by Bertrand Croq ([@bcroq](https://github.com/bcroq))**\n\nUpgrading from SQLAlchemy 1.0.9 to 1.0.10 breaks the following code:\n\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, ForeignKey, Integer, String\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, sessionmaker\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n\nclass User(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'users'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n\n\nclass UserRole(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'user_roles'\n        \n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    \n    row_type = Column(String, nullable=False)\n    __mapper_args__ = {'polymorphic_on': row_type}\n\n    user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=False)\n    user = relationship('User', lazy=False)\n    \n    \nclass Admin(UserRole):\n    __tablename__ = 'admins'\n    __mapper_args__ = {'polymorphic_identity': 'admin'}\n\n    id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('user_roles.id'), primary_key=True)\n    \n\nclass Thing(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'things'\n\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    \n    admin_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('admins.id'))\n    admin = relationship('Admin', lazy=False)\n\n\nengine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', echo=True)\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\nBase.metadata.create_all(engine)\n\nsession = Session()\nprint session.query(Thing).all()\n```\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3614/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
