In the course of which it uncovered half a dozen tests that were invalid since they were assuming `clause1 == clause2` would return True if the two objects were the same.   I think the effort to no longer consider a clause element as having a boolean value is well worth it.\n\n> `What does the `__hash__` issue have to do with the `__nonzero__` method? Couldn't the `__nonzero__` method just always return True?\n\na set or dict in python hashes things based on the return value of `hash(obj)`.  when two objects return the same hash value, the `__eq__()` method is then used to determine if they are the same object or not.   In SQLAlchemy, `__eq__()` returns a `BinaryExpression` object.   therefore `__nonzero__()` must return `True` or `False` depending on how the `BinaryExpression` was created - otherwise ClauseElements cannot be safely hashed.   We had one such issue in cpython when enormous lists of bind parameters were used and we did some workarounds for that one.  But in Jython and other systems this kind of situation is much more prevalent.    Just try out Elixir + SQLA 0.6 before this change + the test case attached to this ticket adapted for Elixir to see for yourself.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441906293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441906294","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1547#issuecomment-441906294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1547","id":441906294,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkwNjI5NA==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2009-09-24T12:46:00Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T04:33:22Z","body":"**Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\nits possible, but then you have this case where any code that says \"if clause:\" will randomly break depending on the type of clause.   since there is one very common subclass of \"clause\" forwhich saying \"if clause:\" is not valid, its a much better idea to set that up for the whole hierarchy with a loud failure.
