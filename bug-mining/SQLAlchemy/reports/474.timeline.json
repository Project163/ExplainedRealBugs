issue, originally created by Leonid Umanskiy**\n\nHi,\nI am trying to implement the search functionality over different columns, including Enum.\nHowever, when I do:\n\n```\ndb.session.query(info_models.ItemProperty).filter(info_models.ItemProperty.grade.like('%'+search_query+'%')).all()\n```\n\nI get an error:\n\n```\n(builtins.LookupError) \"%test%\" is not among the defined enum values [SQL: '...' ]\n\n```\n\nThe SQL provided runs fine. I am not sure about other database engines, but MySQL supports \"LIKE\" queries and it's native Enums just fine. I know I can find a work around by comparing the search query with the enum options first, and then include ones that match, but this is dirty and I rather use the functionality that MySQL provides.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3725/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5924863012,"node_id":"LE_lADOCX5JB84W7QB8zwAAAAFhJjwk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/events/5924863012","actor":{"login":"zzzeek","id":128223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/128223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek","html_url":"https://github.com/zzzeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-20T13:25:40Z","label":{"name":"array of enums","color":"D95FB5"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
