issue, originally created by Scott Torborg ([@scott](https://github.com/scott))**\n\nThe test case below explains it better, but basically, creating a relationship between two joined table subclasses which includes a parent class column in the join conditions causes the relationship to be queried incorrectly.\n\nAdmittedly, this case *does* raise a warning, so it may be unintended usage:\n\n```\n/.../sqlalchemy/lib/sqlalchemy/orm/relationships.py:2368: SAWarning: Non-simple\ncolumn elements in primary join condition for property Cheese.published_pizzas\n- consider using remote() annotations to mark the remote side.\n```\n\nHowever, it used to work, and I'm not sure this particular example can actually be fixed with annotations--so I think this may indicate a regression which could cause other problems as well.\n\nSpecifically, it works up until 0611baa889198421afa932f2af1524bd8826ed7d,\nat which point the mapper initialization starts breaking (with ``TypeError:\n'dict_values' object does not support indexing``). Then, 610e0594e249cd0bb28cb2bd4a7624f63f4510bb \"fixes\" that exception, after which the script below runs, but the assertion at the end fails.\n\nHere's the test:\n\n```python\nfrom sqlalchemy import MetaData, Column, ForeignKey, types\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import create_session, relationship\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\n\nmetadata = MetaData('sqlite://')\nmetadata.bind.echo = True\nBase = declarative_base(metadata=metadata)\n\n\nclass Food(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'foods'\n    id = Column(types.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    name = Column(types.Unicode(255), nullable=False)\n    published = Column(types.Boolean, nullable=False, default=False)\n\n\nclass Pizza(Food):\n    __tablename__ = 'pizzas'\n    food_id = Column(None, ForeignKey('foods.id'), primary_key=True)\n    cheese_id = Column(None, ForeignKey('cheeses.food_id'), nullable=False)\n\n    cheese = relationship('Cheese',\n                          primaryjoin='Pizza.cheese_id == Cheese.food_id',\n                          backref='pizzas')\n\n\nclass Cheese(Food):\n    __tablename__ = 'cheeses'\n    food_id = Column(None, ForeignKey('foods.id'), primary_key=True)\n\n    published_pizzas = relationship(\n        'Pizza',\n        primaryjoin=('and_(Pizza.cheese_id == Cheese.food_id,'\n                     'Pizza.published == True)'))\n\n\nmetadata.create_all()\nsess = create_session()\n\ncheese = Cheese(name='Mozzarella', published=True)\n\npizza1 = Pizza(name='Plain', published=True, cheese=cheese)\npizza2 = Pizza(name='Pepperoni', published=False, cheese=cheese)\npizza3 = Pizza(name='Vegetarian', published=True, cheese=cheese)\n\nsess.add_all([cheese, pizza1, pizza2, pizza3])\nsess.flush()\nsess.expunge_all()\n\nmozzarella = sess.query(Cheese).first()\n\nnames = set(pizza.name for pizza in mozzarella.published_pizzas)\n# Pepperoni isn't published, it shouldn't be returned\nassert 'Pepperoni' not in names\n```\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3364/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
