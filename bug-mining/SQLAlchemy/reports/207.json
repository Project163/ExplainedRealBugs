issue, originally created by Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek))**\n\nseems to be non-deterministic\n\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import *\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import *\nfrom

b1).order_by(b1.b)\n\n```\n\noutput, based on if you uncomment that one query, for the *second* query, is:\n\n```\nSELECT b.id AS b_id, (SELECT max(c.id) AS max_1 \nFROM c \nWHERE c.b_id = b.id) AS anon_1, b_1.id AS b_1_id, (SELECT max(c.id) AS max_2 \nFROM c \nWHERE c.b_id = b_1.id) AS anon_2 \nFROM b, b AS b_1 ORDER BY anon_1\n```\n\ne.g. it is ordering by the wrong expression.\n\nthere's a lot going on with order_by right now so im not sure this can be in 0.9, will need to see if something can be backported.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
