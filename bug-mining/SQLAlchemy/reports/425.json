The closest they come is:\n\n> The above query would join from the Order entity to its related User entity, and the returned Order objects would have the Order.user attribute pre-populated.\n\nIt took me a long time to figure out how this was different from `joinedload` and to understand that it could filter relationship collections. Even just a trivial example that showed a filter on the related entity (and how the resulting graph would look different than it would without `contains_eager`) would go a long way.
