(This is a little confusing, but probably a different issue)\n\nSQLite only returns unique indexes via get_indexes() and unique constraints via get_unique_constraints().\n\nThe reason this problem is seen for SQLite is that only get_indexes() is called via the reflect() method. get_unique_constraints() is not called at all. As a result, only the unique indexes are reflected via the reflect() method.\n\nIt's not clear to me if the problem is ultimately that reflect() doesn't call get_unique_constraints() and thusly MySQL and PostgreSQL drivers should be fixed or if the SQLite driver should be fixed to return unique constraints as part of the get_indexes() method (and unique indexes as part of the get_unique_constraints() method).\n\nI'm leaning towards the former since it confuses me a little bit that get_indexes() and get_unique_constraints() can overlap.\n\nI should also mention that I have only tested MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.

The get_unique_constraints method is not wired into reflecttable at this time.\n\nSo lets fix your test to actually test \"unique constraint\" reflection:\n\n    insp = inspect(engine)\n    print insp.get_unique_constraints(\"test_reflection\")\n\nwe can see that with the exception of MySQL's goofy addition, we are getting the same thing for all three backends:\n\n\n```\n#!\n\nConnecting to mysql://scott:tiger@localhost/test\n[{'column_names': [u's'], 'name': u'test_uc_1'}, {'column_names': [u'r'], 'name': u'test_ui_1'}]\n\nConnecting to postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost/test\n[{'column_names': [u's'], 'name': u'test_uc_1'}]\n\nConnecting to sqlite:///test.sqlite\n[{'column_names': [u's'], 'name': u'test_uc_1'}]\n\n```\n\nSo the issue as described here \"sqlite does not reflect unique constraints\" is not accurate.   This is really just a request to include UniqueConstraint in the Table-level reflection process which is not backend-specific.  This is fine for 1.0, its just a few lines, if you can send me a PR with tests that would be very helpful.\n\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441925831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441925847","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3184#issuecomment-441925847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3184","id":441925847,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyNTg0Nw==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-04T15:33:38Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:36:49Z","body":"**Changes

Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\nSQLAlchemy doesn't \"synthesize\" anything.  We report on exactly what the DB tells us is present.  the problems here are twofold: on MySQL, there is not a one-to-one relationship between the \"CREATE INDEX\" and the \"UNIQUE\" constructs that is present on other databases.  On MySQL they are synonymous:\n\n\n```\nmysql> create table test (a integer, b integer, unique (b));\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> create unique index idx_test_a on test(a);\n\nmysql> show create table test;\n| test  | CREATE TABLE `test` (\n  `a` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,\n  `b` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,\n  UNIQUE KEY `b` (`b`),\n  UNIQUE KEY `idx_test_a` (`a`)\n) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 |\n\n```\nSo above, we had to make a choice.  Do we say that a MySQL table has only unique indexes, and unique constraints don't exist, even though the user said, \"UniqueConstraint()\"?   Or do we say that a MySQL table doesn't have unique indexes, only unique constraints, even though the user said, \"Index(unique=True)\"?  Or do we just say, hey yes, from MySQL's perspective, this table has a UniqueConstraint and an Index(unique=True), and we have no way at all to know which one it was originally.    All three options are a guess, so at least the last guess doesn't try to hide anything.\n\n\nOn Postgresql, the situation is different.  Postgresql actually *creates* an INDEX for the UNIQUE constraint.  So yes, you get two separate constructs for the price of one:\n\n\n```\ntest=> create table test (a integer, b integer, unique(b));\nCREATE TABLE\ntest=> create unique index test_idx_a on test(a);\nCREATE INDEX\ntest=> SELECT conname FROM pg_constraint WHERE conrelid = (SELECT oid FROM pg_class\n    WHERE relname LIKE 'test');\n  conname   \n------------\n test_b_key\n(1 row)\n\ntest=> \\di test*\n              List of relations\n Schema |    Name    | Type  | Owner | Table \n--------+------------+-------+-------+-------\n public | test_b_key | index | scott | test\n public | test_idx_a | index | scott | test\n(2 rows)\n\n```\n\nso again.  This table has two indexes, and a unique constraint.   Are we to try to guess that one of those indexes is really a side effect of one of the constraints we specified?  Would we want to see that in a simple tool like PgAdmin?  Or would we want to see exactly what the database tells us?\n\nThis is part of the reason there's been no hurry to put UniqueConstraint into the Table def on reflection.  The database backends don't really give us a picture that matches how the \"CREATE TABLE\" was set up in the first place, that information is somewhat lost.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441925836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441925837","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3184#issuecomment-441925837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3184","id":441925837,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyNTgzNw==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-04T16:47:23Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:36:48Z","body":"**Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\nWhich anyway is where we get back into Alembic's logic.

It's comparing to hand-rendered metadata so it has a lot of problems here, but as far as this enahncement, if we are to actually produce the UniqueConstraint() object present with Table metadata, e.g. an operation where we do have the chance to reconcile Index and UniqueConstraint, maybe this deduping logic should be present on a per-dialect basis as part of this feature.      Alembic's dedupe logic is more complicated than we'd need here but you can see that at https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/alembic/src/99749650416d096a67e6286b5ea91a67f293a60d/alembic/autogenerate/compare.py?at=master#cl-205.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441925837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441925838","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3184#issuecomment-441925838","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3184","id":441925838,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyNTgzOA==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-04T16:49:48Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:36:48Z","body":"**Johannes Erdfelt ([@jerdfelt](https://github.com/jerdfelt)) wrote:**\n\nDoing a pg_dump --schema-only (see the attachment I made) shows no implicit index.\n\nMaybe postgresql creates an index internally, but it does a good job of not exposing that to the user.\n\nIt looks like the problem with the postgresql driver is that SQLAlchemy is exposing internal implementation details back to the user.\n\nAlso, SQLAlchemy must be doing some filtering of the indexes returned via the \"\\di\" command since my table shows an index for the primary key in my table but SQLAlchemy somehow figures out that it should filter that out of the returned indexes.\n\nI guess it's time to dig into the postgresql driver.
