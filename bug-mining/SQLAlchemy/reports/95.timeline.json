This is described at [the zen of eager loading](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/orm/loading.html#the-zen-of-eager-loading).\n\nUsing sqlite we start with three tables and six rows:\n\n```\nsqlite> create table a (id integer);\nsqlite> create table b (id integer);\nsqlite> create table c (id integer);\nsqlite> insert into a (id) values(1);\nsqlite> insert into a (id) values(2);\nsqlite> insert into a (id) values(3);\nsqlite> insert into b (id) values(1);\nsqlite> insert into b (id) values(3);\nsqlite> insert into c (id) values(3);\n```\n\nIf we load all \"a\"s, and \"eagerload\" bs, using an outer join, that means some \"a\" rows may not have a \"b\" row.  It means we want \"a\" rows 1, 2, 3:\n\n```\nsqlite> select a.* from a left outer join b on a.id=b.id;\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\nif we would like to now also eagerly load every \"c\" for every \"b\", we do an outer join.  the \"a\" rows that we get don't change:\n\n```\nsqlite> select a.* from a left outer join b on a.id=b.id left outer join c on b.id=c.id;\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\nhowever, if we do an inner join directly from \"b\" to \"c\", without parenthesizing results, we now get the wrong answer for \"a\":\n\n```\nsqlite> select a.* from a left outer join b on a.id=b.id join c on b.id=c.id;\n3\n```\n\nnow you might be getting at, we should nest the join from b to c in a parenthesis.  OK, that's a possibility.  The ability for joined eager loading to do this at all was only introduced in version 0.9, a feature we've avoided since SQLite wouldn't allow it.  in http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/changelog/migration_09.html#many-join-and-left-outer-join-expressions-will-no-longer-be-wrapped-in-select-from-as-anon-1, we've modified our approach so that we can do this, and in the case of SQLite we'd generate a SELECT subquery something like this:\n\n```\nsqlite> select a.* from a left outer join (select b.id as b_id from b join c on b.id=c.id) as subq on a.id=subq.b_id;\n1\n2\n3\n```\n\nbut currently 'innerjoin=True' is not that sophisticated and I'm not sure what effort would be needed to make that work.  Is that what you're getting at?\n

I see that, at the end, the ability to specify INNER JOIN ends up being more of helping the DB optimize the query, as the results I'm getting now are, in fact the ones I want, as a strict to-one FK to a target's PK column/s always returns one target row, hence the LEFT OUTER gives the correct result in this case.  \n\nStill, the innerjoin=\"nested\" provides the new functionality without interfering with existing behavior.  I'll take it!  ;-)\n\nThanks again.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441922464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441922465","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/2976#issuecomment-441922465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/2976","id":441922465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyMjQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-15T17:22:34Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:27:31Z","body":"**Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\n- Fixed a regression caused by :ticket:`2976` released in 0.9.4 where\nthe \"outer join\" propagation along a chain of joined eager loads\nwould incorrectly convert an \"inner join\" along a sibling join path\ninto an outer join as well, when only descendant paths should be\nreceiving the \"outer join\" propagation; additionally, fixed related\nissue where \"nested\" join propagation would take place inappropriately\nbetween two sibling join paths.\n\nthis is accomplished by re-introducing the removed flag \"allow_innerjoin\",\nnow inverted and named \"chained_from_outerjoin\".

issue, originally created by Gabor Gombas**\n\nHi,\n\nSee the attached test script - the only difference between classes C and D is the order of the definition of the two relations, yet querying C generates a LEFT OUTER JOIN to A, while querying D generates an inner JOIN as expected. Tested with rel_0_9; 0.8.1 generates the same query in both cases.\n\nGabor\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [test.py](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/3131/test.py)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3131/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
