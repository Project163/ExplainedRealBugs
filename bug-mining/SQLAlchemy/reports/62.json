This may not happen on all tables, but did on at least one of mine.  The problem is in lines 502 and 503 of firebird.py.  They were:\n\n    assert row['fdefault']('fdefault').upper().startswith('DEFAULT '), row\n    defvalue = row['fdefault']('fdefault')![8:](8:)\n\n\nThe problem was, at least in my case, that there was a space before the word DEFAULT in row!['fdefault']('fdefault').  This caused the assertion to fail.  I fixed it with the following code:\n\n    assert row['fdefault']('fdefault').upper().lstrip().startswith('DEFAULT '), row\n    defvalue = row['fdefault']('fdefault').lstrip()![8:](8:)\n\nEverything worked fine after that.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1429/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
