If I\nchange 'DOB' to 'dob' for the include_columns list, the column is\nreflected as 'DOB' ... strange that the reflected name is capitalized,\nbut when I specify all caps for include_columns the field is not\nreflected.\n\nAny recommendations or suggestions for dealing with this issue?\n\n## Reply by Michael T\n\nThe problem is related to this bit of code.:\n\n        if only and name.lower() not in only:\n            self.logger.info(\"Omitting reflected column %s.%s\" %\n                             (table.name, name))\n            return\n\nIf you would please submit a ticket we can get it fixed.\n\nThanks,\n\nMichael\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
