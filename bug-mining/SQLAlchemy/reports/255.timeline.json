I have been working with SQL Server's [CTE](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175972.aspx) and it seems to be working perfect out of the box with the current sqlalchemy implementation *minus* a little detail that deals with cycle recursion problems.\nAs you can see in the following query:\n\n\n```\nWITH cte (EmployeeID, ManagerID, Title) as\n(\n    SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID, Title\n    FROM dbo.MyEmployees\n    WHERE ManagerID IS NOT NULL\n  UNION ALL\n    SELECT cte.EmployeeID, cte.ManagerID, cte.Title\n    FROM cte \n    JOIN  dbo.MyEmployees AS e \n        ON cte.ManagerID = e.EmployeeID\n)\n--Uses MAXRECURSION to limit the recursive levels to 2\nSELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID, Title\nFROM cte\nOPTION (MAXRECURSION 2);\n```\nthere is a final statement **OPTION (MAXRECURSION 2)** that tells the engine to stop when such circular iteration has been reached and prevent circular errors.\n\nAs you can see, the option is not attached to the proper CTE query but to the *select* that will return the final results. I tried to use **suffix_with** with the query we tested this to no avail:\n\n\n```\nq = session.query(\n        included_parts.c.sub_part,\n        func.sum(included_parts.c.quantity).\n            label('total_quantity')\n    ).\\\n    group_by(included_parts.c.sub_part).\\\n    suffix_with(\"OPTION (MAXRECURSION 2)\", dialect='mssql')\n```\n\nthe error I got -logically- was:\n\n\n```\n2014-10-10 10:40:09,626 INFO sqlalchemy.engine.base.Engine {'TABLE_SCHEMA_1': u'dbo', 'TABLE_NAME_1': 'part'}\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/mariano/Code/satori/code/satori/lib/cte_test1.py\", line 39, in <module>\n    group_by(included_parts.c.sub_part).\\\nAttributeError: 'Query' object has no attribute 'suffix_with'\n```\nsince the Query object has the [prefix_with](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/orm/query.html?highlight=prefix_with#sqlalchemy.orm.query.Query.prefix_with) option, I assume it is ok that it has the suffix_with option too.
