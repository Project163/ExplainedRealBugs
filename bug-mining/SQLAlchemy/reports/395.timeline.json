This works great assuming somewhere you map the enum type directly as a column. I only have my enum type mapped as an ArrayOfEnum. create_all() and drop_all() do not recognize the enum so it neither creates nor drops the type.\n\n```\nday_of_week_type = Enum('Su', 'Mo', 'Tu', 'We', 'Th', 'Fr', 'Sa', name='days_of_week')\n\nclass Party(Model):\n    <snip>\n    days_of_week = Column(ArrayOfEnum(day_of_week_type))\n    <snip>\n```\n\nwill fail if I actually try to create and insert a Party object. However simply doing:\n\n```\nclass Party(Model):\n    <snip>\n    day_of_week = Column(day_of_week_type)\n    days_of_week = Column(ArrayOfEnum(day_of_week_type))\n    <snip>\n```\n\nworks. Somewhere in at least one mapping, the actual enum type needs to be mapped directly and not via an ArrayOfEnum\n\nI've been digging around and can think of a couple of ugly solutions, but was wondering if there is a quick and elegant solution to this little problem.\n\nIdeas?\n\nThanks
