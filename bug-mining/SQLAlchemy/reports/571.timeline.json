mode, the offset is an integer indicating that the frame starts or ends that many peer groups before or after the current row's peer group, where a peer group is a group of rows that are equivalent according to the window's ORDER BY clause.\n> - In RANGE mode, use of an offset option requires that there be exactly one ORDER BY column in the window definition. Then the frame contains those rows whose ordering column value is no more than offset less than (for PRECEDING) or more than (for FOLLOWING) the current row's ordering column value. In these cases the data type of the offset expression depends on the data type of the ordering column. For numeric ordering columns it is typically of the same type as the ordering column, but for datetime ordering columns it is an interval. In all these cases, the value of the offset must be non-null and non-negative. Also, while the offset does not have to be a simple constant, it cannot contain variables, aggregate functions, or window functions.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/2884830105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CaselIT","id":16175304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc1MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16175304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT","html_url":"https://github.com/CaselIT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17677987585,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOCX5JB862zwuVzwAAAAQdsK8B","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/events/17677987585","actor":{"login":"CaselIT","id":16175304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc1MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16175304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT","html_url":"https://github.com/CaselIT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-15T19:17:15Z","label":{"name":"high
