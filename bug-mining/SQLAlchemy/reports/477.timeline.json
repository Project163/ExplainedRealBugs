Expiration means that the database-persisted values of the object are discarded.  If you look inside of `object.__dict__`, all the keys like 'id' are gone.  The second part is that when you access these attributes normally, their current database value is [lazy loaded](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/glossary.html#term-lazy-loads), which re-instates the value as freshly retrieved from the database .   The documentation tries to make the reader familiar with this mostly within the [object relational tutorial](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/orm/tutorial.html#adding-and-updating-objects) which illustrates the SQL being emitted as expired attributes are being re-accessed, as well as from the glossary entry which also includes links to further documentation.\n\nI can also respond to all your points individually but I'm hoping that just these two concepts will make it clear.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441932411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441932413","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3640#issuecomment-441932413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3640","id":441932413,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkzMjQxMw==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-01T07:59:02Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:55:33Z","body":"**zestyping ([@zestyping](https://github.com/zestyping)) wrote:**\n\nYou're right, we have different expectations about what expiration should do in this case.\n\nAs far as I know, the common understanding of lazy loading is that it's supposed to be transparent, as with most operations called \"lazy\"—in other words, the client doesn't have to know or care whether the loading is lazy.  The laziness doesn't affect the semantics of the operation; whether the data is lazily loaded or eagerly loaded, the same data is there when it is observed.\n\nThe inconsistent behaviour is the real issue here, which is why I've been trying to describe this in terms of invariants rather than definitions of terms.  Do you see why it is surprising to get a different result based only on whether something was observed?  Do you think most SQLAlchemy users get this?  Or perhaps is it just that make_transient() a wizard-level operation, below the level of abstraction that you would recommend most users should work at, and thus only to be used by people who understand the inner workings of SQLAlchemy in unusual detail?\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441932413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441932414","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3640#issuecomment-441932414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3640","id":441932414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkzMjQxNA==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-01T15:22:24Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:55:33Z","body":"**Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\nre: the \"invariants\".  #1 is inaccurate because make_transient does not change the state of any attributes;  The None is present because make_transient does not assume you'd like to unexpire any existing expired attributes.  The other \"invariants\" make a similar assumption.   There are many methods that do not assume a \"pre-unexpire\" action and will deliver a detached object with unloaded state.   It would be completely impractical to pre-unexpire in many cases, and the only alternative would be to not provide such methods at all, including session.close(), session.expunge(), session.expunge_all(), make_transient(), and others.    Unexpiration impies not only SQL-per-object but also a flush(), these are the most heavyweight operations the ORM does and bundling them into every state-management method would be very undesirable. \n\nIf all methods were to require a fully stringent, completely airtight form of \"consistency\", the library would be forced to forego a tremendous amount of flexibility and functionality.    SQLAlchemy was designed to avoid this issue by purposely embracing the inherent \"leakiness\" of non-trivial abstractions, instead of struggling to hide all leaks, it makes them part of the public API.   This might sound strange but it is the fundamental reason for SQLAlchemy's success, a \"practicality beats purity\", if you will.   \n\nFor an ORM with a much more stringent sense of \"consistency\" in this regard you might look at the Storm ORM.

([@zestyping](https://github.com/zestyping)) wrote:**\n\nHi Mike.  I agree, updating the documentation is a good course of action and would have been my first proposal.  Thanks for making this change.\n\nTo answer your question from a few comments up, \"merely reading a variable x will not change the observed value of some other variable y\" refers to the commented line in the example script — the third-last line, `y.value`.  If I uncomment that line, the output changes from `None` to `1` because, as you explained, accessing `y.value` has the side-effect of loading the value from the database before `make_transient`, so the value remains visible after `make_transient`.  Because accessing `y.value` loads all the attributes of the instance, it has the even more surprising effect that if `y` had some more attributes `foo` and `bar`, accessing `y.foo` would change the later observed value of `y.bar`.\n\nLazy-loading is not itself evil! :)  It's the combination of lazy-loading, expiry, and `make_transient()`'s current functionality that produces the surprising effect in this case.  The best idea I have at the moment for how to produce consistent behaviour is to make `make_transient()` expire all attributes, so that it always makes all the attributes appear to become `None`, instead of sometimes appearing to keep their values and sometimes appearing to become `None`.  This would achieve the goal that merely accessing any attribute has no visible effect on outcomes, without the cost of pre-unexpiring all the attributes.\n\nThere are many existing users of SQLAlchemy, and I respect that the disruption caused by a change to the API could be hard to justify.  I don't know if this change would cause a lot of breakage.  I guess I do wonder, if anyone is relying on values to still be present after `make_transient()`, in what circumstances is that actually useful behaviour?  Do you consider it an intentional part of the design that the attribute values remain present if unexpired, or is that somewhat of an accident?  Clearly `make_transient()` is not for the purpose that I had incorrectly assumed (I wanted to turn a just-committed instance into a plain data container that doesn't have side effects on the database), and I'm not understanding its actual intended use cases—sorry about that.\n\nIn any case, the documentation changes you've made are very clear and would have been great at helping me avoid encountering this.

The APIs that control whether or not attributes are present are explicit, e.g. you queried for the whole entity, you didnt map with deferred(), you didn't call commit() first, etc.\n\nIn my own use case I simply loaded the object normally, made sure i didn't expire any of its attributes, and made the copy.   You can iterate through all attributes and access them if you're looking for a generalized system of ensuring this.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441932437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441932439","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3640#issuecomment-441932439","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3640","id":441932439,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkzMjQzOQ==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-10T14:53:17Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:55:35Z","body":"**Michael
