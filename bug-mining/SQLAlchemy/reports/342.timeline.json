Added a new \"soft invalidate\" feature to the\nconnection pool at the level of the checked out connection wrapper\nas well as the :class:`._ConnectionRecord`.  This works similarly\nto a modern pool invalidation in that connections aren't actively\nclosed, but are recycled only on next checkout; this is essentially\na per-connection version of that feature.  A new event\n:class:`.PoolEvents.soft_invalidate` is added to complement it.\nfixes #3379\n\n- Added new flag\n:attr:`.ExceptionContext.invalidate_pool_on_disconnect`.\nAllows an error handler within :meth:`.ConnectionEvents.handle_error`\nto maintain a \"disconnect\" condition, but to handle calling invalidate\non individual connections in a specific manner within the event.\n\n- Added new event :class:`.DialectEvents.do_connect`, which allows\ninterception / replacement of when the :meth:`.Dialect.connect`\nhook is called to create a DBAPI connection.  Also added\ndialect plugin hooks :meth:`.Dialect.get_dialect_cls` and\n:meth:`.Dialect.engine_created` which allow external plugins to\nadd events to existing dialects using entry points.\nfixes
