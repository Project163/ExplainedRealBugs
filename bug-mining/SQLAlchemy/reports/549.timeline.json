Description\r\n\r\nI ran into this originally in sqlalchemy2-stubs: https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy2-stubs/pull/251, where `RowMapping` only supported string keys according to the type hints. I ran into a similar issue here upgrading our application where because `RowMapping` subclassed `Mapping[str, Any]`, `Row._mapping.get()` would fail to typecheck when used with `Column` objects.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a test to verify that `Row._mapping.get()` continues to work with both strings and `Column`s, though it doesn't look like mypy checks types in the tests.\r\n\r\nFixes #9644.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n<!-- go over following points. check them with an `x` if they do apply, (they turn into clickable checkboxes once the PR is submitted, so no need to do everything at
