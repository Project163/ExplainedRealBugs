Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\nWhile there is a simple way to make this work in what I think is an acceptable way, it has to occur on your end (basically, setting a distinct primaryjoin, which is what you did.  Set it to None instead of \"\", btw.).   I don't think there's a way that SQLAlchemy could be guessing how to interpret this, and beyond that, lazy loading doesn't generate JOINs.   You can produce lazy loads that have JOINs rendered, but the JOIN would always have to come from an existing target mapper which is mapped to a JOIN in some way or a special \"secondary\" target that refers to a JOIN; that is, within \"produce a lazy load from A to B\", no new \"JOIN\" is produced that wasn't already defined.   The complexity of lazyload having to decide that a particular primaryjoin implies a JOIN should be created, when meanwhile it's really not what you want anyway, isn't really worth it and would make life harder for everyone (surprising, buggy, complicated, etc., and not even what you want!)\n\nThe key pattern behind why this produces bad SQL is because the relationship of Person.city is specifically omitting a City that has a \"deleted_at\" value.    So then if we say, \"given a City, what is the collection of People for that City?\".  OK, if City.deleted_at is None, this is simple, it is all the People rows with city_id=<city.id>.\n\nBut if City.deleted_at is non NULL.  Is it:  A. all the Person objects which refer to this City via city_id?  B. no Person objects, because City is deleted?   or C. this is an invalid request; for a City with deleted_at is non NULL, the list of Person objects associated with it is undefined?\n\nIt's because the behavior of this backref case is inherently ambiguous that happens to correspond with SQL that makes no sense either.\n\nWe can add documentation clarifying the behavior of primaryjoin when used in a backref but that's about it here.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441922096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441922104","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/2948#issuecomment-441922104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/2948","id":441922104,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyMjEwNA==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-09T12:40:50Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:26:27Z","body":"**Changes

result of a backref.\nLoading rows from ``child`` in this case would keep ``parent.deleted == False``\nas is within the query, thereby yanking it into the FROM clause\nand doing a cartesian product.
