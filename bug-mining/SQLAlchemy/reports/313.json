It seems that `_no_criterion_assertion` should be equivalent to `self._statement is None and _no_select_modifiers`; it is surprising that `_from_obj` is omitted, as this can result in a very dangerous situation when doing bulk updates, since `_from_obj` is ignored entirely.\n\nFor example, someone may mistakenly use a join instead of a filter:\n\n```\n(session.query(File)\n .join(File.folder)\n .filter(Folder.owner_id == 1)\n .update({'content': 'USER 1'}, synchronize_session=False))\n```\n\nresults in `UPDATE file SET content='USER 1' FROM folder WHERE folder.owner_id = 1`\nwhich will touch every file instead of just ones belong to user 1.\n\nThe suggested fix is to add: `('_from_obj', 'join()', ())` in `_no_select_modifiers`, which will error, as demonstrated in attached file.\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [join_bulk_update.py](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/3349/join_bulk_update.py)\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3349/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
