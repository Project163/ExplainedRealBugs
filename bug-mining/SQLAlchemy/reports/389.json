This is the modern rendition of NTEXT or TEXT, and SQL Alchemy translates String() into VARCHAR(MAX). With SQL Server 2012 or later, this happens automatically, and it's described in http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/changelog/changelog_10.html#change-f520106ec3455eaa056110c048aa4862 .\n\nHowever, on reflection (through the inspector) you can end up with a VARCHAR (sql type-)object that has a length of \"max\" (i.e. a string). Printing that object causes an exception. As a very simple and contrived example:\n\nfrom sqlalchemy import VARCHAR\nprint VARCHAR()\nprint VARCHAR(80)\nprint VARCHAR(\"max\")  # Fails in _render_type_string\n\nAttached find a simple test program that creates a table with a String() column, then reflects it to discover the VARCHAR(MAX) column.\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [t.py](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/3504/t.py)\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
