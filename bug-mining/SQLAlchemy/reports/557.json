See [Chapter 63](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tableam.html) for more information. If this option is not specified, the default table access method is chosen for the new table. See [default_table_access_method](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-DEFAULT-TABLE-ACCESS-METHOD) for more information.\r\n\r\nSome variants of Postgres use this to allow creating tables with different access methods, e.g. `columnar`.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-METHOD\r\n\n\n### Databases / Backends / Drivers targeted\n\nPostgreSQL\n\n### Example Use\n\n```python\r\nTable(\"my_columnar_table\", metadata, ..., postgresql_using=\"columnar\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich would translate to\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE my_columnar_table (...) USING columnar;\r\n```\n\n### Additional context\n\nThe overall purpose is to support [Hydra databases](https://docs.hydra.so/concepts/using-hydra-columnar), so I may need to create a new dialect anyway but this still would be nice to have for the builtin postgres dialect.\r\n\r\nIs this as easy as updating https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/blob/b455b1fc03e25fc6a53cac74f3cee515c3efbf8a/lib/sqlalchemy/dialects/postgresql/base.py#L2381\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/blob/b455b1fc03e25fc6a53cac74f3cee515c3efbf8a/lib/sqlalchemy/dialects/postgresql/base.py#L3001-L3010\r\n\r\n?","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/10904/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/10904/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
