Database reflection failed on my table due to Currency type not being recognised.\n2.  Building SQL statements with functions (eg, func.sum(field_name)) failed due to a missing return statement.\n3.  SQL statements with a JOIN in them were not able to be run, since Access 97 does not support bare 'JOIN' clauses.  It only supports INNER JOIN, LEFT (OUTER) JOIN, RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN.\n\nI attach a patch file that addresses all three issues, a test program and database.\n\nThe first two fixes are single line fixes and I don't think are controversial.\n\nFor the third problem I copied visit_join from compiler.py into access.py and added the INNER keyword. I have no idea if this is the 'right' way to fix this problem or not.  My other thought would be to have a flag in access.py that visit_join in compiler.py checks and uses to return the INNER keyword when appropriate.\n\nCheers,\n\nRasjid.\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [patch1.mdb](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/1017/patch1.mdb) | [access-sqlalchemy.patch](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/1017/access-sqlalchemy.patch) | [test.py](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/1017/test.py)\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1017/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
