`__slots__` were not in order.\r\n\r\nFixes #7527\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm fixing two types of slots mistakes:\r\n- [x] remove overlapping slots (i.e. slots already defined on a base class)\r\n- [x] fix broken inheritance (i.e. slots class inheriting from a non-slots class)\r\n  - [x] slots added to base class `TransactionalContext`. It seemed to use two attributes, which I've added as slots.\r\n  - [x] empty slots removed from `ORMOption`. Its base class explicitly makes use of `__dict__` so empty slots don't add anything.\r\n  - [x] empty slots added to `PostLoader`. It doesn't appear to use any slots not already defined on its base classes.\r\n  - [x] empty slots added to `IterateMappersMixin`. It doesn't appear to use any slots not already defined on its subclasses.\r\n  - [x] empty slots added to `ImmutableContainer`. It doesn't use any fields.\r\n  - [x] empty slots added to `OperatorType`. It's a protocol.\r\n  - [x] empty slots added to `InternalTraversal`, `_HasTraversalDispatch`. They don't seem to use attributes on their own.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nThis pull request is:\r\n\r\n- [x] A short code fix\r\n\t- please include the issue number, and create an issue if none exists, which\r\n\t  must include a complete example of the issue.  one line code fixes without an\r\n\t  issue and demonstration will not be accepted.\r\n\t- Please include: `Fixes: #<issue number>`
