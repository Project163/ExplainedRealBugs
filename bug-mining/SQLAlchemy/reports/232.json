issue, originally created by Kent Bower ([@kentbower](https://github.com/kentbower))**\n\nThe documentation for Select.with_hint() method gives two Oracle examples with the \"+ \" included as the passed text argument, but sqlalchemy generates that part of the hint automatically.\n\nSo, contrary to the docs, using \n\n```\n select([mytable]).with_hint(mytable, \"+ index(%(name)s ix_mytable)\")\n```\n\nActually renders: \n```\nSELECT /*+ + index(mytable ix_mytable) */\n```\n\nDocs should remove the leading \"+ \" in both places.\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments:
