issue, originally created by Gregory Bronner ([@gbronner](https://github.com/gbronner))**\n\nWhen trying to run a very simple example, I get the following error:\n```\nAttributeError: '_ListenerCollection' object has no attribute '_exec_once'\n\n\n```\n\nCode is as follows:\n\n\n```\nimport sqlalchemy \nimport urllib\nparams = urllib.quote_plus(\"DRIVER={SQL Server};SERVER=XXXX;DATABASE=YYYY;UID=ZZZZ;PWD=AAAA\")\n\n\nengine = sqlalchemy.create_engine('mssql+pypyodbc:////?odbc_connect=%s' %params )\nfor row in engine.execute('select 1+1 from TestRun'):\n    print (row)\n```\nComplete stack trace is: \n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n\n  File \"c:\\program files (x86)\\IronPython 2.7\\lib\\site-packages\\sqlalchemy\\pool.py\", line 1052, in

Bug #\nSource of the bug seems to be in attr.py in the _CompoundListener;  the object \n```\n_exec_once_mutex\n```\nnever gets created,  and the \n```\n_exec_once \n\n```\nobject is referred to by **self**, when it is a class variable.\n\n\n\n```\nclass _X(object):\n    def __enter__(self):\n        pass\n    def __exit__(self,a,b,c):\n        pass\n        \nclass _CompoundListener(_InstanceLevelDispatch):\n    _exec_once = False\n    #_exec_once_mutex= _X()\n    \n    __slots__ = '_exec_once_mutex',\n\n    def _memoized_attr__exec_once_mutex(self):\n        return threading.Lock()\n\n    def exec_once(self, *args, **kw):\n        \"\"\"Execute this event, but only if it has not been\n        executed already for this collection.\"\"\"\n        #change to _CompoundListener._exec_once\n        if not self._exec_once:\n```\n\nI was able to get it to run (mostly) by furnishing an object for the _exec_once_mutex, as well as by changing uses of _exec_once to be class, rather than instance variables.  Still, I had other issues.\n\nThe sample code works nicely on .0.9.9, so this is a regression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3494/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
