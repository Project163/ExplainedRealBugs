But also, the way \"autoincrement\" is, it's a flag set that defaults to True.   It makes the autoincrement thing happen any time it's valid, and in this case, it is valid.   if we made it not do this, then we need to change autoincrement to a three-value field in order to make this possible, and then it's yet another major API change that might throw people off.   it affects literally every integer primary key column out there and I don't know offhand what the impacts of that are going to be, given alembic, sqlalchemy-migrate, etc.    we're at that phase where I am constantly amazed at how the most innocuous changes completely blow up openstack and other major

This is now the\ndefault for all columns, no longer True.\n- the work of determining _autoincrement_column now moves to\nPrimaryKeyConstraint itself, as \"autoincrement\" is explictly a pk-only\nconcept\n- pkc detects autoincrement at the same time Table did, based on memoized_property.\nattempts to make this a more \"active\" setting are more complicated because\nduring table construction with or without reflection the columns within the\npkc are in flux and determiniations can't really be made without\nlooking at all columns.\n- with the difference between \"auto\" and True, we now can add validation\nrules when True is set:  1. only one column may have autoincrement=True\n2. autoincrement=True *requires* an Integer type, error is raised otherwise\n3. column default has to be None or a Sequence 4. column server_default has\nto be None or server-reflected\n- when autoincrement=True is not set, we're looking for autoincrement='auto'.\nWe only care about 'auto' when there is *only one column in the PK*.  E.g.\nwe no longer set *any* column to \"autoincrement\" implicitly if the key\nis composite, this requires \"autoincrement=True\".

implicit, e.g. SQLite,\nshould raise an error now when autoincrement=True is set and can't\nbe satisfied; SQLite dialect now raises this if autoincrement=True\non a composite primary key since SQLite
