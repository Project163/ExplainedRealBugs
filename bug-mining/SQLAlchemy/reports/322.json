issue, originally created by Christophe Biocca ([@christophebiocca](https://github.com/christophebiocca))**\n\nRelation without Foreign Key, when lazyloading (immediately after a `session.flush()`), tries to use `symbol('NOT_SET')` in a query.\n\nI've attached a simple script that reproduces the problem on postgres, although I don't believe it to be backend specific.\n\nOnly happens on 1.0.0, earlier versions aren't affected.\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments:
