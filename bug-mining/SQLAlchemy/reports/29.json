issue, originally created by Anonymous**\n\nHello,\n\nas http://www.sqlalchemy.org/trac/wiki/05Migration says, session.save_or_update() is deprecated in favor of session.add()\n\nHowever, sqlalchemy.orm.unitofwork.UOWEventHandler still uses save_or_update, and so, it prints a warning on the console.\n\nThe fix is trivial, but a diff is attached to this ticket.\n\nThanks!\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments:
