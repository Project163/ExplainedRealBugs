My python is a bit rusty, so feel free to correct me as needed. Also, I'm using python 3.4.1 and (obviously) oursql with MySQL server version 5.6.17. This code does everything I want except that `last_access` does not get created as `NOT NULL`:\n\n\tfrom sqlalchemy import MetaData, TIMESTAMP, Integer, Enum, Column, text\n\tfrom

I'm doing development locally using the MySQL server from [AMPPS](http://www.ampps.com/), and they have the server variable `explicit_defaults_for_timestamp` set ON by default, which is apparently now recommended as of MySQL v5.6.6 (see MySQL upgrading link below).\n\nHere's a link to the docs for [`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp`](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_explicit_defaults_for_timestamp). This is also mentioned in the upgrading to 5.6 document [here](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/upgrading-from-previous-series.html) (search for \"TIMESTAMP with implicit DEFAULT value\"). It looks like the current nonstandard behavior is being deprecated.\n\nBased on this new info, IMO you should honor an explicit `nullable` setting in the DDL, so the expected result is emitted regardless of whether the `explicit_defaults_for_timestamp` server variable exists, or how it is set.\n\nSo, you can reproduce my results by using MySQL v5.6 and in my.cnf add setting:\n\n`explicit_defaults_for_timestamp=1`\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441925402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441925403","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3155#issuecomment-441925403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3155","id":441925403,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyNTQwMw==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-07T02:33:08Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:35:33Z","body":"**Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\n\nOK looking again, server_onupdate doesn't have that purpose right now, there does not seem to be anything built in to the MySQL dialect in order to render the non-SQL-standard \"ON UPDATE\" clause.

reviewing the documentation for [Column](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/metadata.html#sqlalchemy.schema.Column.params.server_default) and a couple issues here (#3155,#3444), it's still unclear how to \"correctly\" include an explicit \"ON UPDATE\" clause.\r\n\r\nThe only solution I have come to so far was specifically recommended against in a comment on #3155\r\n\r\n> **Michael Bayer ([@zzzeek](https://github.com/zzzeek)) wrote:**\r\n> 1. It is incorrect to say `server_default=text('CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP')`.   That is an attempt to \"game\" the DDL generation and is unnecessary.   Use `server_onupdate` for the UPDATE part.\r\n\r\nA TIMESTAMP column *may* include this [implicitly](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/timestamp-initialization.html), but DATETIME columns never do. TIMESTAMP has some significant limitations, so I need to use DATETIME, and therefore an explicit ON UPDATE clause:\r\n``` SQL\r\n    `date_created` DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,\r\n    `date_updated` DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\r\n```\r\nDefining the \"date_created\" Column seems pretty straightforward:\r\n``` Py\r\nColumn('date_created', DateTime, nullable=False, server_default=DefaultClause(text('CURRENT_TIMESTAMP')))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the \"date_updated\" column, I would naturally replace `server_default` with `server_onupdate`. However, while `server_default` comes coupled with a canned `DefaultClause()`, there doesn't appear to be an analogous `OnUpdateClause()`. I'm guessing that's because ON UPDATE, unlike DEFAULT, is specific to MySQL. In fact - while not documented as such - it appears that `server_onupdate` also accepts a String argument, and also creates a `DefaultClause()` instance in that case, just like `server_default`. The only actual difference I could find is that using `server_onupdate` defaults `for_update` to True.\r\n\r\nEdit: I noticed that the behavior *is* documented at [sqlalchemy.schema.DefaultClause](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/defaults.html#sqlalchemy.schema.DefaultClause), but not at [sqlalchemy.schema.Column.params.server_onupdate](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/metadata.html#sqlalchemy.schema.Column.params.server_onupdate).\r\n\r\nGiven the understandable disparagement of the \"hacky\" solution above (appending ON UPDATE to the DEFAULT clause), is there another supported means to add the `ON UPDATE` clause?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/4652/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/4652/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
