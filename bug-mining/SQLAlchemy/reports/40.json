It defaults to 'dbo'.  If the user's default schema is not 'dbo', this method fails to return the the correct schema name.\n\nExample:\n\n\n    import sqlalchemy as sa\n    e = sa.create_engine('mssql://scott:tiger@localhost/test')\n    print e.dialect.get_default_schema_name(e) # is dbo, but should be test.\n\n\nI'm attaching a patch which uses an approach similar to the postgres dialect.  Before the patch, with a default schema != 'dbo', one test would fail in test/dialect.mssql.py and all tests in test/engine/reflection.py failed.  With the patch, all of these tests pass.\n\n-Randall\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [mssql.py.diff](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/1258/mssql.py.diff)\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/1258/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
