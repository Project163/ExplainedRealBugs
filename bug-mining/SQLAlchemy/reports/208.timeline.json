Otkidach ([@ods](https://github.com/ods)) wrote:**\n\nAlthough proposed patch does work for this particual test case I don't think it solves the actual problem. I believe the problem is not related to `orderinglist`. One thing in `bulk_replace` function looks strange to me: all additions go to the newly formed collection, while removals go to the old one. It looks like inconsistent behavior. Any custom collection doing some salculations based on the state of the whole collection will recieve `remove` calls for old collection that presents some state that is not related to what we actually have. Here is an example without `orderinglist` (even without customising collection class) that demonstrates this:\n\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, ForeignKey\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import relationship\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\nclass Link(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'Link'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    doc_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('Doc.id'), nullable=False)\n    order = Column(Integer, nullable=False, default=0)\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return 'Link(id={})'.format(self.id)\n\nclass Doc(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'Doc'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)\n    links = relationship(Link, order_by=[Link.order])\n\na2 = Link(id=2)\ndoc = Doc()\ndoc.links = [Link(id=1), a2]\nold_links = doc.links\nprint old_links # [Link(id=1), Link(id=2)]\n\ndoc.links = [Link(id=3), a2]\nprint old_links # [Link(id=2)]\n```\n\nHere we see `old_links` now has the state that is neither old, nor new one.
