The issue occurs when you try to un-relate some records with overlapping keys.\n\nHere's my example:\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, ForeignKey, Integer, String, ForeignKeyConstraint\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, relationship\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n# Lets simulate a multi-tenant database system that doesn't use multiple schemas\nclass Tenant(Base):\n\t__tablename__ = 'tenant'\n\tid = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n\tname = Column(String)\n\n# Something to be related to\nclass Friend(Base):\n\t__tablename__ = 'friend'\n\tid = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n\ttenant_id = Column(ForeignKey('tenant.id'), primary_key=True)\n\tname = Column(String)\n\ttenant = relationship(Tenant)\n\n# Our model\nclass Person(Base):\n\t__tablename__ = 'person'\n\tid = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n\ttenant_id = Column(ForeignKey('tenant.id'), primary_key=True)\n\tfriend_id = Column(Integer)\n\tname = Column(String)\n\n\t__table_args__ = (\n\t\t# friend relationship\n\t\tForeignKeyConstraint(\n\t\t\t(friend_id, tenant_id),\n\t\t\t('friend.id','friend.tenant_id'),\n\t\t),\n\t)\n\n\ttenant = relationship(Tenant)\n\tfriend = relationship(Friend)\n\nengine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', echo=True)\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\n\ndef run():\n\t# Basic Setup\n\tBase.metadata.create_all(engine)\n\tsession = Session()\n\n\t# Make a person with a friend\n\ttenant = Tenant(name=\"testing\", id=1)\n\tperson = Person(name=\"Bob\", tenant=tenant, id=1)\n\tfriend = Friend(name=\"George\", tenant=tenant, id=1)\n\tperson.friend = friend\n\tsession.add_all([tenant, person, friend])\n\tsession.commit()\n\n\t# Take away the friend\n\tperson = session.query(Person).first()\n\tperson.friend = None\n\tsession.commit()\n\t# it tries to take away the tenant_id too, thus breaking the primary key\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n\trun()\n```\n\nWhen I run it, I get this:\n\n```\nAssertionError: Dependency rule tried to blank-out primary key column 'person.tenant_id' on instance '<Person at 0x105c05310>'\n```\n\nIt shouldn't be blanking out the tenant_id, since that id still references the tenant.  The relationship needs to know that, despite joining on a composite key here, only one of those columns is specific to this relationship.  The other is shared with many other relationships.\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3230/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
