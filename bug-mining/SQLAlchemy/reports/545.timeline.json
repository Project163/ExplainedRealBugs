Description\r\n<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nFixes #9168\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces common occurrences of [PEP 585](https://peps.python.org/pep-0585/) style type annotations with annotations compatible with older versions of Python.\r\n\r\nI searched for instances of the following supported types from the PEP and replaced with their legacy typing couterparts.\r\n\r\n* tuple # typing.Tuple\r\n* list # typing.List\r\n* dict # typing.Dict\r\n* set # typing.Set\r\n* frozenset # typing.FrozenSet\r\n* type # typing.Type\r\n\r\n```\r\ngrep -r \"list\\[.*\\]\" ./build --exclude-dir=\"./build/venv/*\" --exclude-dir=\"./build/output/*\" --exclude=\"changelog_[0-9]*\\.rst\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI excluded changelog files from being altered, I think some of these could be changed if necessary but others are likely to require manual checking as the change may target the new typing style specifically.\r\n\r\nFor any examples that included imports, I tried to ensure that the correct typing imports were included and properly ordered.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n<!-- go over following points. check them with an `x` if they do apply, (they turn into clickable checkboxes once the PR is submitted, so no need to do everything at once)\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis pull request is:\r\n\r\n- [x] A documentation / typographical error fix\r\n\t- Good to go, no issue or tests are needed\r\n- [ ] A short code fix\r\n\t- please include the issue number, and create an issue if none exists, which\r\n\t  must include a complete example of the issue.  one line code fixes without an\r\n\t  issue and demonstration will not be accepted.\r\n\t- Please include: `Fixes: #<issue number>` in the commit message\r\n\t- please include tests.   one line code fixes without tests will not be accepted.\r\n- [ ] A new feature implementation\r\n\t- please include the issue number, and create an issue if none exists, which must\r\n\t  include a complete example of how the feature would
