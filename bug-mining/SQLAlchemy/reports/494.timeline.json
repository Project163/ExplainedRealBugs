The problem is that this doesn't work. No matter what, it thinks there is a state issue because the insert is returning -1 for the number of rows modified.\n\nAdding implicit_returning seems to fix it, so for all intents and purposes using a 'timestamp' column in MS SQL is like using a trigger and seems to preclude getting a row count
