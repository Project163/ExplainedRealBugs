issue, originally created by Marco Martinez ([@marcomartinez](https://github.com/marcomartinez))**\n\nI'm trying to get ``column_descriptions`` from a query that I'm building that contains multiple joins to the same target, but I'm getting the following error message:\n\n```\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"bug-alias.py\", line 37, in test\n    query.column_descriptions\n  File \"/home/mmartinez/env/sa/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/query.py\", line 2583, in column_descriptions\n    for ent in self._entities\n  File \"/home/mmartinez/env/sa/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/util.py\", line 398, in __getattr__\n    raise AttributeError(key)\nAttributeError: entity\n```\n\nHere's an example of what my code pre-1.0 was doing:\n\n\n```\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\nfrom sqlalchemy import orm\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\nSession = orm.Session()\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n\nclass User(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'user'\n    id = sa.Column(sa.Integer(), primary_key=True)\n    name = sa.Column(sa.Unicode(), nullable=False, unique=True)\n\n\nclass MyData(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'mydata'\n\n    id = sa.Column(sa.Integer(), primary_key=True)\n\n    data = sa.Column(sa.Unicode(), nullable=False, unique=True)\n\n    created_by_id = sa.Column(sa.ForeignKey(User.id))\n    created_by = orm.relationship(User, foreign_keys=[created_by_id])\n\n    modified_by_id = sa.Column(sa.ForeignKey(User.id))\n    modified_by = orm.relationship(User, foreign_keys=[modified_by_id])\n\nCreator = orm.aliased(User)\nModifier = orm.aliased(User)\n\nquery = (\n    Session.query(\n        MyData.data,\n        sa.literal(u'why').label('someliteral'),   # Literals will fail too\n        Creator.name.label('created_by'),\n        Modifier.name.label('modfied_by')\n    )\n    .join(Creator, MyData.created_by)\n    .join(Modifier, MyData.modified_by)\n)\n\nprint ([d['name'] for d in query.column_descriptions])                                  \n```\n\nReading the 1.0 changlog, I tried this instead (which worked) :\n\n```\nquery = (\n    Session.query(\n        MyData.data,\n        sa.literal(u'why').label('someliteral'),\n    )\n    .join(MyData.created_by, aliased=True)\n    .add_column(User.name.label('created_by'))\n    .reset_joinpoint()\n    .join(MyData.modified_by, aliased=True)\n    .add_column(User.name.label('modified_by'))\n    .reset_joinpoint()\n)\n\nprint ([d['name'] for d in query.column_descriptions]) \n\n```\n\nAm I missing something? Thanks in advance.\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3417/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
