thing, a setuptools-less Python environment these days does not exist.\n\nthis is important because the [hack](https://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/src/eed8bcef3ae1341cc9c25f5abff55a9ff880cfac/lib/sqlalchemy/testing/distutils_run.py?at=master) we do right now at the end says \"ran one test\", and
