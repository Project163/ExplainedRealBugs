It has to do with the fact that the \"implicit\" value for an attribute is also None, e.g.:\n\n\n```\n>>> m = Model()\n>>> m.x\nNone\n```\n\nfor a long time, the above \"get\" operation would actually set the value of None in the state.   This was just changed in 1.0 which is described in http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/changelog/migration_10.html#changes-to-attribute-events-and-other-operations-regarding-attributes-that-have-no-pre-existing-value.    So only with that change is it even at all feasible for us to tell the difference between a column where one said `m.x = None` vs. `print m.x`, as far as if that `None` is the thing we want to insert.\n\nHowever, a lot of things are changing in 1.0, like, lots, so changing this behavior more fundamentally is really not something I want to get into, it's very deep and would really cause a lot of problems for people as it's worked this way for literally ten years.   \n\nIf you want to force it to NULL, you can actually say that, using null():\n\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, create_engine, null\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n\nclass A(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'a'\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n    x = Column(Integer, nullable=True, default=1)\n\ne = create_engine(\"sqlite://\", echo=True)\nBase.metadata.create_all(e)\n\ns = Session(e)\ns.add(A(x=null()))\ns.commit()\nassert s.query(A.x).scalar() == None\n\n```\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441926836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441926839","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3250#issuecomment-441926839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3250","id":441926839,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyNjgzOQ==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-14T13:36:00Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:39:31Z","body":"**Oleg Pidsadnyi ([@olegp](https://github.com/olegp)) wrote:**\n\nThanks for reminding about null()!\nStill in the bottom of my heart I feel like m.a = None assignment is an explicit operation, unlike __get__ indeed.\nI guess the setter could set null() when explicit assignment to None is going on:\n\nm.a = None  # null() is assigned here internally\n\nIt feels like assigning implicit None to explicit None makes sense.

issue, originally created by jan.budinsky ([@janbudinsky](https://github.com/janbudinsky))**\n\nDefault column value is not overridden by `NULL` in `Declarative API` as it should be.\n\nIf a column has a non-null default value that is overridden by another non-null value, everything works as expected - the specified value is always inserted as the value of the column instead of the default one.\n\nThis however does not seem to be the case when overriding non-null default value with `NULL`. If a matching row (via primary key) has been already created (`merge` does `UPDATE`), the column will have `NULL` filled as its value, as expected. But if a matching row hasn't been created yet (`merge` does `INSERT INTO`), the column will have default value instead of expected `NULL`.\n\nThe issue is the same using both `postgresql` and `in-memory sqlite`.\n\nPlease see the script below reproducing the issue, thank you.\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, scoped_session\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\nfrom sqlalchemy import Column\nfrom sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import BIGINT, VARCHAR\n\n\nCONN_STR = \"sqlite:///:memory:\"\nBase = declarative_base()\n\n\nclass Table(Base):\n    __tablename__ = \"table\"\n\n    id = Column(BIGINT, primary_key=True)\n    field = Column(VARCHAR, default=\"placeholder\")\n\n\ndef merge(session, row):\n    session.begin()\n    try:\n        session.merge(row)\n        session.commit()\n    except:\n        session.rollback()\n        raise\n\n\ndef select(session, table, **criteria):\n    return session.query(table).filter_by(**criteria).all()\n\n\ndef delete(session, table, **criteria):\n    return session.query(table).filter_by(**criteria).delete()\n\n\ndef main():\n    engine = create_engine(CONN_STR, echo=False)\n    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)  # create table\n    session = scoped_session(sessionmaker(bind=engine, autocommit=True))()\n\n    data_null = {\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"field\": None\n    }\n    data_value = {\n        \"id\": 2,\n        \"field\": \"value\"\n    }\n\n    # cleanup\n    delete(session=session, table=Table, id=data_null[\"id\"])\n    delete(session=session, table=Table, id=data_value[\"id\"])\n\n    merge(session=session, row=Table(**data_null))\n    print(select(session=session, table=Table, id=data_null[\"id\"])[0].field)  # \"placeholder\" ???\n    merge(session=session, row=Table(**data_null))\n    print(select(session=session, table=Table, id=data_null[\"id\"])[0].field)  # None\n\n    merge(session=session, row=Table(**data_value))\n    print(select(session=session, table=Table, id=data_value[\"id\"])[0].field)  # \"value\"\n    merge(session=session, row=Table(**data_value))\n    print(select(session=session, table=Table, id=data_value[\"id\"])[0].field)  # \"value\"\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\nEnvironment:\n```\npython version - 3.6.3\nSQLAlchemy version - 1.2.8\n```\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/4278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/4278/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
