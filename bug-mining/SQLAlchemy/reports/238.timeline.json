If you do in fact have more than one Friend row with the same \"id\" and different \"tenant_id\" (which would be interesting to confirm), then you do in fact need Person.friend to query on both Person.friend_id and Person.tenant_id in order to ensure the correct row.\n\nTo call this a bug means SQLAlchemy would know how to guess that, even though Person.tenant_id is used as a foreign key in two different relationships, only one of those relationships is the \"real\" one for which SQLAlchemy should be poking in an incoming (or being erased) \"tenant_id\" value.\n\nFor example.   What if you had a Person, and you assign to it Tenant(id=5) and Person(id=2, tenant_id=7) ?   Which one wins? (answer: whichever one you did last.)    SQLAlchemy at best would at configruation time raise an error that this setup is ambiguous (and that is something that *maybe* SQLAlchemy could do here, to express that hey, you are putting this tenant_id column into a conflicting position).\n\nRight now, forget about the removal of the friend.  Here's another easy one:\n\n\n```\ntenant = Tenant(name=\"testing\", id=1)\ntenant2 = Tenant(name=\"testing\", id=2)\nperson = Person(name=\"Bob\", tenant=tenant, id=1)\n\nfriend = Friend(name=\"George\", tenant=tenant2, id=1)\nsession.add_all([tenant, person, friend])\n\nsession.commit()  # INSERT: person tenant_id=1\n\nperson.friend = friend\nsession.commit()  # UPDATE:  person SET tenant_id=2, friend_id=1\nassert person.tenant is tenant  # <-- nope\n\n```\n\nThe model here is just leaving out a really critical detail, which is, which relationship gets to write into tenant_id?\n\nTo tell relationship() this information, you set up a primaryjoin along with which columns are foreign_keys at the same time:\n\n```\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import foreign\n\nclass Person(Base):\n    friend = relationship(\n        Friend,\n        primaryjoin=and_(\n            foreign(friend_id) == Friend.id,\n            tenant_id == Friend.tenant_id\n        )\n    )\n\n```\n\nnow if we do the above test of Friend(id=1, tenant_id=2) / Tenant(id=1), with foreign keys enabled (I used Postgresql), we get the expected constraint violation when we try to associate the incongruous friend with Person:\n\n\n```\nUPDATE person SET friend_id=%(friend_id)s WHERE person.id = %(person_id)s AND person.tenant_id = %(person_tenant_id)s\n{'person_id': 1, 'friend_id': 1, 'person_tenant_id': 1}\n\nsqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (psycopg2.IntegrityError) insert or update on table \"person\" violates foreign key constraint \"person_friend_id_fkey\"\nDETAIL:  Key (friend_id, tenant_id)=(1, 1) is not present in table \"friend\".\n```\n\nand the original case works fine too:\n\n\n```\nperson.friend = None\nsession.commit()\nassert person.tenant is tenant\nassert person.friend is None\n\n```\n\nThe best SQLA could do here is warn that Person.tenant_id is being used in two contradictory writing contexts, though I think it becomes apparent that this is the case anyway (just less clearly).\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441926596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441926597","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3230#issuecomment-441926597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3230","id":441926597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkyNjU5Nw==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-18T22:26:56Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:38:47Z","body":"**Michael
