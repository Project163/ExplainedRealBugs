It would be nice if the async interface followed a similar pattern and had an `async_creator` parameter for performing the same functionality but with an async function.\r\n\r\n### Databases / Backends / Drivers targeted\r\n\r\nWould be used for all asyncio drivers. (`asyncpg`, `aiomysql`, `psycopg2` etc)\r\n\r\n### Example Use\r\n\r\nThe [Cloud SQL Python Connector](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-python-connector) is looking to support drivers such as `aiomysql` and `asyncpg` and requires the `creator` argument currently for it's synchronous supported drivers ([Example](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-python-connector/blob/main/README.md#how-to-use-this-connector)). \r\n\r\nWe would like to support the same functionality but with async drivers as follows:\r\n```python\r\nimport asyncio\r\nimport asyncpg\r\nfrom google.cloud.sql.connector import Connector\r\nfrom sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine\r\n\r\n# initialize Cloud SQL Python Connector object\r\nconnector = Connector()\r\n\r\n# creator function to return the database connection\r\nasync def getconn() -> asyncpg.Connection:\r\n    conn: asyncpg.Connection = await connector.connect_async(\r\n        \"project:region:instance\",  # Cloud SQL connection name\r\n        \"asyncpg\",  # database driver\r\n        user=\"root\",\r\n        password=\"shhh\",\r\n        db=\"your-db-name\"\r\n    )\r\n    return conn\r\n\r\n# create connection pool\r\npool = create_async_engine(\r\n    \"postgresql+asyncpg://\",\r\n    async_creator=getconn,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nIn progress Cloud SQL Python Connector [PR](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-sql-python-connector/pull/390) looking to add support for asyncpg which would want this use case.
