issue, originally created by Charles-Axel Dein ([@charlax](https://github.com/charlax))**\n\nI'm upgrading a codebase to sqlalchemy 1.0.0beta5  from 0.9.9.\n\nIt seems that version 1 removed the ability to be forgiving about mentioning a join twice:\n\n```\nsession.query(Toaster).join(Toast).join(Toast).all()\n```\n\nThis will raise with postgres: `ProgrammingError: (psycopg2.ProgrammingError) table name \"toasts\" specified more than once`\n\nThe same query run with sqla 0.9.9 runs fine, because I guess it removes the duplicate join.\n\nI'm not sure that can be considered a regression given that joins should not be mentioned more than once, but it's definitely a different behavior from 0.9.9\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3367/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
