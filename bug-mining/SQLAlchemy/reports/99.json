As a first step, I've found that `Mutable.changed()` fails:\n\n```\n    def changed(self):\n        for parent, key in self._parents.items():\n            flag_modified(parent, key)\n```\n\nBecause `self._parents` are empty. That's because in `MutableBase.set()`, when I do `product.attrdata = product.attrdata`:\n\n```\n        def set(target, value, oldvalue, initiator):\n            if not isinstance(value, cls):\n                value = cls.coerce(key, value)\n            if value is not None:\n                value._parents[target.obj()] = key\n            if isinstance(oldvalue, cls):\n                oldvalue._parents.pop(target.obj(), None)\n            return value\n```\n\n`value is oldvalue` and parent gets popped after it was set. If I switch these two if's, then `Mutable.changed()` will call `flag_modified()`, but it won't flag properly it anyway (I didn't dig much further and don't have a patch to fix a problem).\n\nIs it a bug or I shouldn't do things like `product.attrdata = product.attrdata` in the first place?\n\nSQLAlchemy version 0.9.3\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/2997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/2997/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
