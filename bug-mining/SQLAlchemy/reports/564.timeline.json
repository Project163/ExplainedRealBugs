not sure it can be fixed, since changing the current logic would change the current documented  behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe main issue here is that we have an union that includes None in the column type, since this is a json column and there are two null supported: json-null and sql-null. This conflicts with the logic used to detect if a column is nullable, meaning that in the type map we look for the union-without-none.\r\n\r\nOverall this case is undecidable, so I would flag it as won't fix, maybe adding that special case to the error message / linked error link.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/2263943777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CaselIT","id":16175304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTc1MzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16175304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT","html_url":"https://github.com/CaselIT","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaselIT/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14480543067,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCX5JB86IQpQHzwAAAANfG41b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/events/14480543067","actor":{"login":"RazerM","id":1337586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzc1ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1337586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM","html_url":"https://github.com/RazerM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"78bef6b19de1cd4149174356ea802568a52b0036","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RazerM/sqlalchemy/commits/78bef6b19de1cd4149174356ea802568a52b0036","created_at":"2024-10-01T23:13:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"RazerM","id":1337586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzc1ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1337586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM","html_url":"https://github.com/RazerM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RazerM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-01T23:16:02Z","updated_at":"2024-10-01T23:16:02Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/11942","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/11942/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/11942/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/11942/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/pull/11942","id":2560370155,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCX5JB859ULCW","number":11942,"title":"Permit

#11370\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a general summary of your proposed changes in the Title field above -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSome types which a user may want to put in the type annotation map are already optional. JSON is a good example because without any constraint, the type can be `None` via JSON `null` or SQL `NULL`.\r\n\r\nBy permitting optional types in the type annotation map, everything just works, and `mapped_column(nullable=False)` is available if desired.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n<!-- go over following points. check them with an `x` if they do apply, (they turn into clickable checkboxes once the
