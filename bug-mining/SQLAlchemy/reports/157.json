It turned out that it makes a huge difference if a change is committed inside a nested transaction or flushed inside the main transaction.\n\nFrom the database side I expect these to be equivalent:\n\n## Original instructions ##\n\n```\nbegin;\n-- add stuff to the database\nrollback;\n```\n\n## Updated instructions using nested transactions ##\n\n```\nbegin;\nsavepoint inner;\n-- add stuff to the database\nrelease savepoint inner;\nrollback;\n```\n\n# Rationale #\n\nWhen the instructions inside the nested transaction complete successfully, it should make no difference if they are inside a savepoint demarcation or not.\n\n# Example code #\n\nPlease have a look at the attached file nested_rollback.rst. It runs to completion here without error but illustrates the current problem. You can run it using\n\n```\npython -m doctest nested_rollback.rst\n```\n\nThis seems to be related to issue #2658.\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [nested_rollback.rst](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/3108/nested_rollback.rst) | [nested_rollback.html](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/3108/nested_rollback.html)\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
