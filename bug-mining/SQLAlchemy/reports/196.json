The documentation is explicit about this (good): http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/dialects/mysql.html#rowcount-support\n\nHowever, the documentation also says that it is possible to override this setting through the client_flag url argument. While it is indeed possible to set manually this client_flag argument, the FOUND_ROWS bit is set unconditionally in dialects/mysql/mysqlconnector.py\n\nHence, the attached patch (generated against git master) to allow callers who know what they are doing to override this default behavior in sqlalchemy\n\n----------------------------------------\nAttachments: [found-rows.patch](../wiki/imported_issue_attachments/3146/found-rows.patch)\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3146/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
