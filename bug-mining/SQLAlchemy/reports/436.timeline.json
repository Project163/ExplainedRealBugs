But in this case, contains_eager() has the desire to add additional columns to select from, to the top of the SELECT, in order to populate the collection.   When it does so, the inner subquery can't provide what it needs, because it doesn't supply the columns from Label needed on the outside.\n\nNow, this is very easy to fix, however note that *I* had no idea what to do with this for about ten minutes, so this is not at all intuitive until you see it, then it seems easy, but as far as users knowing to do this, I'd not expect anyone to come up with this without some serious thinking.  So there is definitely a place here that we might want to add a documentation note to contains_eager().  Because if I don't even think it's possible at first, well, I wrote the thing so there you go :).\n\nAnyway - we just add those columns to the inner query so that they are available:\n\n\n```\nquery = query.add_columns(label_alias.id, label_alias.name)\nquery = query.from_self()\n\n\nquery = query.options(\n    contains_eager(\n        'labels', alias=label_alias\n    ).load_only('id', 'name')\n)\n\n```\n\n\nthen we get the right statement:\n\n```\nSELECT anon_1.label_alias_id, anon_1.label_alias_name, anon_1.venue_id, anon_1.venue_name \nFROM (SELECT venue.id AS venue_id, venue.name AS venue_name, label_alias.id AS label_alias_id, label_alias.name AS label_alias_name \nFROM venue JOIN venue_to_label AS venue_to_label_1 ON venue.id = venue_to_label_1.venue_id JOIN label AS label_alias ON label_alias.id = venue_to_label_1.label_id \nWHERE label_alias.name IN (%(name_1)s)) AS anon_1\n```\n\n\nif you can confirm that this actually works with data and returns the right results and all that, that would be great.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441931016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/comments/441931039","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3544#issuecomment-441931039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues/3544","id":441931039,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTkzMTAzOQ==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-29T19:04:05Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T05:51:39Z","body":"**Changes
