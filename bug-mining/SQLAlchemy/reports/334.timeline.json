The rationale for the\nswitch was due to Declarative taking the step of setting up\nthe full \"instrumentation manager\" for a class before it was mapped\nfor the purpose of the new ``@declared_attr`` features\ndescribed in :ref:`feature_3150`, but the change was also made\nagainst the classical use of :func:`.mapper` for consistency.\nHowever, SQLSoup relies upon the instrumentation event happening\nbefore any instrumentation under classical mapping.\nThe behavior is reverted in the case of classical and declarative\nmapping, the latter implemented by using a simple memoization\nwithout using class manager.\nfixes #3388\n\n\n→
