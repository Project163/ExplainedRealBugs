It no longer raises an exception, but it's not correct: the CTE isn't placed at the start of the SQL statement. The compiler's .isupdate and .isinsert state attributes assume there's only a single DML statement to compile, so in the provided test case with an UPDATE CTE used by an INSERT, the compiler gets confused about whether the statement under compilation is an insert or update. I think a separate class ModifyingCTE(Alias), in the .dml module, works better than complicating the existing CTE class.
