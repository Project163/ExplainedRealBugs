 The `Engine` will ask the connection pool for a connection when the `connect()` or `execute()` methods are called.  The default connection pool, `QueuePool`, as well as the default connection pool used with SQLite, `SingletonThreadPool`, will open connections to the database on an as-needed basis.  As concurrent statements are executed, `QueuePool` will grow its pool of connections to a default size of five, and will allow a default "overflow" of ten.   Since the `Engine` is essentially "home base" for the connection pool, it follows that you should keep a single `Engine` per database established within an application, rather than creating a new one for each connection.
