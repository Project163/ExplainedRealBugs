+
+ResultSet column matching enhancements; positional column setup for textual SQL
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+A series of improvements were made to the :class:`.ResultProxy` system
+in the 1.0 series as part of :ticket:`918`, which reorganizes the internals
+to match cursor-bound result columns with table/ORM metadata positionally,
+rather than by matching names, for compiled SQL constructs that contain full
+information about the result rows to be returned.   This allows a dramatic savings
+on Python overhead as well as much greater accuracy in linking ORM and Core
+SQL expressions to result rows.  In 1.1, this reorganization has been taken
+further internally, and also has been made available to pure-text SQL
+constructs via the use of the recently added :meth:`.TextClause.columns` method.
+
+TextAsFrom.columns() now works positionally
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+The :meth:`.TextClause.columns` method, added in 0.9, accepts column-based arguments
+positionally; in 1.1, when all columns are passed positionally, the correlation
+of these columns to the ultimate result set is also performed positionally.
+The key advantage here is that textual SQL can now be linked to an ORM-
+level result set without the need to deal with ambiguous or duplicate column
+names, or with having to match labeling schemes to ORM-level labeling schemes.  All
+that's needed now is the same ordering of columns within the textual SQL
+and the column arguments passed to :meth:`.TextClause.columns`::
+
+
+    from sqlalchemy import text
+    stmt = text("SELECT users.id, addresses.id, users.id, "
+         "users.name, addresses.email_address AS email "
+         "FROM users JOIN addresses ON users.id=addresses.user_id "
+         "WHERE users.id = 1").columns(
+            User.id,
+            Address.id,
+            Address.user_id,
+            User.name,
+            Address.email_address
+         )
+
+    query = session.query(User).from_statement(text).\
+        options(contains_eager(User.addresses))
+    result = query.all()
+
+Above, the textual SQL contains the column "id" three times, which would
+normally be ambiguous.  Using the new feature, we can apply the mapped
+columns from the ``User`` and ``Address`` class directly, even linking
+the ``Address.user_id`` column to the ``users.id`` column in textual SQL
+for fun, and the :class:`.Query` object will receive rows that are correctly
+targetable as needed, including for an eager load.
+
+This change is **backwards incompatible** with code that passes the columns
+to the method with a different ordering than is present in the textual statement.
+It is hoped that this impact will be low due to the fact that this
+method has always been documented illustrating the columns being passed in the same order as that of the
+textual SQL statement, as would seem intuitive, even though the internals
+weren't checking for this.  The method itself was only added as of 0.9 in
+any case and may not yet have widespread use.  Notes on exactly how to handle
+this behavioral change for applications using it are at :ref:`behavior_change_3501`.
+
+.. seealso::
+
+    :ref:`sqlexpression_text_columns` - in the Core tutorial
+
+    :ref:`behavior_change_3501` - backwards compatibility remarks
+
+Positional matching is trusted over name-based matching for Core/ORM SQL constructs
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+Another aspect of this change is that the rules for matching columns have also been modified
+to rely upon "positional" matching more fully for compiled SQL constructs
+as well.   Given a statement like the following::
+
+    ua = users.alias('ua')
+    stmt = select([users.c.user_id, ua.c.user_id])
+
+The above statement will compile to::
+
+    SELECT users.user_id, ua.user_id FROM users, users AS ua
+
+In 1.0, the above statement when executed would be matched to its original
+compiled construct using positional matching, however because the statement
+contains the ``'user_id'`` label duplicated, the "ambiguous column" rule
+would still get involved and prevent the columns from being fetched from a row.
+As of 1.1, the "ambiguous column" rule does not affect an exact match from
+a column construct to the SQL column, which is what the ORM uses to
+fetch columns::
+
+    result = conn.execute(stmt)
+    row = result.first()
+
+    # these both match positionally, so no error
+    user_id = row[users.c.user_id]
+    ua_id = row[ua.c.user_id]
+
+    # this still raises, however
+    user_id = row['user_id']
+
+Much less likely to get an "ambiguous column" error message
+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
+
+As part of this change, the wording of the error message ``Ambiguous column
+name '<name>' in result set! try 'use_labels' option on select statement.``
+has been dialed back; as this message should now be extremely rare when using
+the ORM or Core compiled SQL constructs, it merely states
+``Ambiguous column name '<name>' in result set column descriptions``, and
+only when a result column is retrieved using the string name that is actually
+ambiguous, e.g. ``row['user_id']`` in the above example.  It also now refers
+to the actual ambiguous name from the rendered SQL statement itself,
+rather than indicating the key or name that was local to the construct being
+used for the fetch.

+
+TextClause.columns() will match columns positionally, not by name, when passed positionally
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+
+The new behavior of the :meth:`.TextClause.columns` method, which itself
+was recently added as of the 0.9 series, is that when
+columns are passed positionally without any additional keyword arguments,
+they are linked to the ultimate result set
+columns positionally, and no longer on name.   It is hoped that the impact
+of this change will be low due to the fact that the method has always been documented
+illustrating the columns being passed in the same order as that of the
+textual SQL statement, as would seem intuitive, even though the internals
+weren't checking for this.
+
+An application that is using this method by passing :class:`.Column` objects
+to it positionally must ensure that the position of those :class:`.Column`
+objects matches the position in which these columns are stated in the
+textual SQL.
+
+E.g., code like the following::
+
+    stmt = text("SELECT id, name, description FROM table")
+
+    # no longer matches by name
+    stmt = stmt.columns(my_table.c.name, my_table.c.description, my_table.c.id)
+
+Would no longer work as expected; the order of the columns given is now
+significant::
+
+    # correct version
+    stmt = stmt.columns(my_table.c.id, my_table.c.name, my_table.c.description)
+
+Possibly more likely, a statement that worked like this::
+
+    stmt = text("SELECT * FROM table")
+    stmt = stmt.columns(my_table.c.id, my_table.c.name, my_table.c.description)
+
+is now slightly risky, as the "*" specification will generally deliver columns
+in the order in which they are present in the table itself.  If the structure
+of the table changes due to schema changes, this ordering may no longer be the same.
+Therefore when using :meth:`.TextClause.columns`, it's advised to list out
+the desired columns explicitly in the textual SQL, though it's no longer
+necessary to worry about the names themselves in the textual SQL.

+Specifying Result-Column Behaviors
+----------------------------------------------
+
+We may also specify information about the result columns using the
+:meth:`.TextClause.columns` method; this method can be used to specify
+the return types, based on name::
+
+    stmt = stmt.columns(id=Integer, name=String)
+
+or it can be passed full column expressions positionally, either typed
+or untyped.  In this case it's a good idea to list out the columns
+explicitly within our textual SQL, since the correlation of our column
+expressions to the SQL will be done positionally::
+
+    stmt = text("SELECT id, name FROM users")
+    stmt = stmt.columns(users.c.id, users.c.name)
+
+When we call the :meth:`.TextClause.columns` method, we get back a
+:class:`.TextAsFrom` object that supports the full suite of
+:attr:`.TextAsFrom.c` and other "selectable" operations::

+        select_from(j).where(stmt.c.name == 'x')
+

+        """Merge a cursor.description with compiled result column information.
+
+        There are at least four separate strategies used here, selected
+        depending on the type of SQL construct used to start with.
+
+        The most common case is that of the compiled SQL expression construct,
+        which generated the column names present in the raw SQL string and
+        which has the identical number of columns as were reported by
+        cursor.description.  In this case, we assume a 1-1 positional mapping
+        between the entries in cursor.description and the compiled object.
+        This is also the most performant case as we disregard extracting /
+        decoding the column names present in cursor.description since we
+        already have the desired name we generated in the compiled SQL
+        construct.
+
+        The next common case is that of the completely raw string SQL,
+        such as passed to connection.execute().  In this case we have no
+        compiled construct to work with, so we extract and decode the
+        names from cursor.description and index those as the primary
+        result row target keys.
+
+        The remaining fairly common case is that of the textual SQL
+        that includes at least partial column information; this is when
+        we use a :class:`.TextAsFrom` construct.   This contruct may have
+        unordered or ordered column information.  In the ordered case, we
+        merge the cursor.description and the compiled construct's information
+        positionally, and warn if there are additional description names
+        present, however we still decode the names in cursor.description
+        as we don't have a guarantee that the names in the columns match
+        on these.   In the unordered case, we match names in cursor.description
+        to that of the compiled construct based on name matching.
+        In both of these cases, the cursor.description names and the column
+        expression objects and names are indexed as result row target keys.
+
+        The final case is much less common, where we have a compiled
+        non-textual SQL expression construct, but the number of columns
+        in cursor.description doesn't match what's in the compiled
+        construct.  We make the guess here that there might be textual
+        column expressions in the compiled construct that themselves include
+        a comma in them causing them to split.  We do the same name-matching
+        as with textual non-ordered columns.
+
+        The name-matched system of merging is the same as that used by
+        SQLAlchemy for all cases up through te 0.9 series.   Positional
+        matching for compiled SQL expressions was introduced in 1.0 as a
+        major performance feature, and positional matching for textual
+        :class:`.TextAsFrom` objects in 1.1.  As name matching is no longer
+        a common case, it was acceptable to factor it into smaller generator-
+        oriented methods that are easier to understand, but incur slightly
+        more performance overhead.
