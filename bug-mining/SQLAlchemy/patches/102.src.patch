+        removal of the ``setuptools.Feature`` extension from setuptools.
+        If this keyword isn't present, the setup will still succeed
+        with setuptools rather than falling back to distutils.  C extension
+        building can be disabled now also by setting the
+        DISABLE_SQLALCHEMY_CEXT environment variable.  This variable works
+        whether or not setuptools is even available.

+   For versions of SQLAlchemy prior to 0.9.4 or 0.8.6, the
