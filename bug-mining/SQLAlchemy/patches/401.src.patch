+
+  To disable the weak referencing behavior and force all objects
+  within the session to remain until explicitly expunged, configure
+  :class:`.sessionmaker` with the ``weak_identity_map=False``
+  setting.   However note that this option is **deprecated**;
+  it is present only to allow compatibility with older
+  applications, typically those that were made back before SQLAlchemy
+  had the ability to effectively weak-reference all objects.
+  It is recommended that strong references to objects
+  be maintained by the calling application externally to the
+  :class:`.Session` itself, to the extent that is required by the application.
+  This eliminates the
+  :class:`.Session` as a possible source of unbounded memory growth in the case
+  where large numbers of objects are being loaded and/or persisted.
+
+  Simple examples of externally managed strong-referencing behavior
+  include loading objects into a local dictionary keyed to their primary key,
+  or into lists or sets for the span of time that they need to remain referenced.
+  These collections can be associated with a :class:`.Session`, if desired,
+  by placing them into the :attr:`.Session.info` dictionary.  Events such
+  as the :meth:`.SessionEvents.after_attach` event may also be of use for
+  intercepting objects as they are associated with a :class:`.Session`.
