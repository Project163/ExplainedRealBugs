+
+    :meth:`.Session.bulk_update_mappings`
+
+
+Comparison to Core Insert / Update Constructs
+---------------------------------------------
+
+The bulk methods offer performance that under particular circumstances
+can be close to that of using the core :class:`.Insert` and
+:class:`.Update` constructs in an "executemany" context (for a description
+of "executemany", see :ref:`execute_multiple` in the Core tutorial).
+In order to achieve this, the
+:paramref:`.Session.bulk_insert_mappings.return_defaults`
+flag should be disabled so that rows can be batched together.   The example
+suite in :ref:`examples_performance` should be carefully studied in order
+to gain familiarity with how fast bulk performance can be achieved.
+
+ORM Compatibility
+-----------------
+
+The bulk insert / update methods lose a significant amount of functionality
+versus traditional ORM use.   The following is a listing of features that
+are **not available** when using these methods:
+
+* persistence along :meth:`.relationship` linkages
+
+* sorting of rows within order of dependency; rows are inserted or updated
+  directly in the order in which they are passed to the methods
+
+* Session-management on the given objects, including attachment to the
+  session, identity map management.
+
+* Functionality related to primary key mutation, ON UPDATE cascade
+
+* SQL expression inserts / updates (e.g. :ref:`session_sql_expressions`)
+
+* ORM events such as :meth:`.MapperEvents.before_insert`, etc.  The bulk
+  session methods have no event support.
+
+Features that **are available** include::
+
+* INSERTs and UPDATEs of mapped objects
+
+* Version identifier support
+
+* Multi-table mappings, such as joined-inheritance - however, an object
+  to be inserted across multiple tables either needs to have primary key
+  identifiers fully populated ahead of time, else the
+  :paramref:`.Session.bulk_save_objects.return_defaults` flag must be used,
+  which will greatly reduce the performance benefits
