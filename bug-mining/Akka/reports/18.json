I guess this use case is quite common, e.g. for the root actor which doesn't handle any messages but watches its child actors. Therefore some easier way would be appreciated.","closed_by":{"login":"patriknw","id":336161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjE2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/336161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw","html_url":"https://github.com/patriknw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23640/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
