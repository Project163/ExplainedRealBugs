We can see the scaling decision was made at `2:32:41`, it would have taken a second or two for the request made on the Kubernetes API to result in the node actually shutting down, so at around `2:32:43` the shard coordinator would have received the `GracefulShutdownReq`, started the `RebalanceWorker` which defaults to a 60 second rebalance handoff so that would have timed out at `2:33:43`. That's why the last retry request message is seen at `2:33:42`. I don't see any other 60 second timeouts that might cause this behaviour.\r\n\r\nSo, why is it timing out? Well, don't know exactly, but we can see at `2:32:44`, the node leaves the cluster, and communication with it shuts down shortly after that. At some point the shard coordinator receives a `Terminated` for that region, to handle this it updates its state and removes the region from its list of gracefully terminating entities, however, it doesn't remove the shards that were currently being rebalanced from the `rebalanceInProgress` set. This might be a bug, if a node that previously indicated it is gracefully terminating goes away, then isn't it implied that handoff finished? Shouldn't the shards being rebalanced from it be removed?\r\n\r\nAs for the reason hand off is timing out... I'll take guess. There's no ack sent from the `RebalanceWorker` when `ShardStopped` is sent to it. The `Shard` actor will send the `ShardStopped` message to the `RebalanceWorker`, and then it just stops itself, then the region stops, and the coordinated shutdown promise is redeemed. At that point, I guess remoting shuts down and the actor system terminates. But, did the `ShardStopped` message get through? If it was buffered, I guess not, does remoting drain all buffers when its told to shutdown? And I'm seeing these messages during load tests, where I guess there's a high chance of there being a buffer of unsent messages.\r\n\r\nSo one potential solution to this might be for the `Rebalance` to ack the shard stopped, so that the `Shard` actor can know the message got through, and shutdown. That's assuming that's the bug. What I will do is insert a delay into coordinated shutdown that tries to ensure any messages that are meant to be sent through remoting are drained before remoting is shutdown, if the problem goes away, then I guess that's the bug.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/comments/508335811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/comments/508337129","html_url":"https://github.com/akka/akka-core/issues/27259#issuecomment-508337129","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/27259","id":508337129,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODMzNzEyOQ==","user":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-04T04:51:50Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T04:51:50Z","body":"Just looked into it a bit deeper, cluster sharding is shutdown before the cluster is left, and if the cluster leaves, it has to send a message to all the nodes in the cluster, that message won't be sent until after the shard stopped messages are sent, and since that message did get through, the shard stopped messages must have got through.

The rebalance worker won't tell the node to hand off its shards until all shard regions have acked the begin hand off message. This includes regions that are currently gracefully shutting down. So, if sometime before the `BeginHandOff` message is received by the `ShardRegion` actor of the first node shutting down, it finishes hand off and the actor is shut down, then it's not going to ack, and that will prevent hand off of the second region to start.\r\n\r\nIs this causing the problem? In the logs I see 715ms between when the `RebalanceActor` starts, and when the coordinator logs that the region has terminated. There is no configured removal margin, so that log message is not delayed by that. It feels like maybe it's a little too long? Can there be a delay that long between an actor terminating and a remote watcher receiving the termination signal?\r\n\r\nI guess to fix the problem, I guess the rebalance worker needs to watch the shard regions itself. If that's expensive, it can just watch the regions that are currently gracefully shutting down.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/comments/508358066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/comments/508361949","html_url":"https://github.com/akka/akka-core/issues/27259#issuecomment-508361949","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/27259","id":508361949,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODM2MTk0OQ==","user":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-04T06:50:27Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T06:50:27Z","body":"Ok, I managed to find the logs (turns out I've got GKE stack driver logging enabled, which means I can see all the logs for nodes that have shut down), and I can confirm that only 3 out of 4 nodes received the `BeginHandOff` messages, and the one that didn't receive it was the node that was the first shutting down node.
