the following snippet:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport akka.actor.ActorSystem\r\nimport akka.stream.ActorMaterializer\r\nimport akka.stream.scaladsl.{Sink, Source}\r\nimport akka.stream.testkit.scaladsl.TestSink\r\n\r\nobject Test extends App {\r\n  implicit val system = ActorSystem()\r\n  implicit val materializer = ActorMaterializer()\r\n\r\n  var count = 0\r\n\r\n  def makeSource = {\r\n    Source.unfoldResource[Int, Int](\r\n      () => {\r\n        count = count + 1\r\n        println(\"obtaining: \" + count)\r\n        count\r\n      },\r\n      c => if(c > 5) {\r\n        println(\"Limit reached!\")\r\n        throw new Exception(\"\")\r\n      } else {\r\n        Some(c)\r\n      },\r\n      c => {\r\n        println(\"releasing: \" + c)\r\n        count = count - 1\r\n      }\r\n    ).map(_ * 2)\r\n     .recover { case e => 23 }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  1.to(10).map(_ => makeSource).foreach { s =>\r\n    val p = s.runWith(TestSink.probe)\r\n    p.request(1) // Generate demand.\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\nobtaining: 1\r\nobtaining: 2\r\nobtaining: 3\r\nobtaining: 4\r\nobtaining: 5\r\nobtaining: 6\r\nLimit reached!\r\nreleasing: 6\r\nreleasing: 6\r\nobtaining: 5\r\nobtaining: 6\r\nLimit reached!\r\nreleasing: 6\r\nreleasing: 6\r\nobtaining: 5\r\nobtaining: 6\r\nLimit reached!\r\nreleasing: 6\r\nreleasing: 6\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code creates 10 streams, each of which tries to obtain a resource using `Source.unfoldResource`, does some processing (here a `map`) and `recovers` from any errors. The resource is limited, so after a certain point some of these streams fail to obtain the resource  resulting in `close` passed to `Source.unfoldResource` being called twice in every such case.\r\n\r\nIs this the expected and correct behaviour? I would expect it to relese the resource only once and the correct output to be the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nobtaining: 1\r\nobtaining: 2\r\nobtaining: 3\r\nobtaining: 4\r\nobtaining: 5\r\nobtaining: 6\r\nLimit reached!\r\nreleasing: 6\r\nobtaining: 6\r\nLimit reached!\r\nreleasing: 6\r\nobtaining: 6\r\nLimit reached!\r\nreleasing: 6\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, moving the `if` further downstream as in the following snippet makes it work as expected:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// ...\r\n  def makeSource = {\r\n    Source.unfoldResource[Int, Int](\r\n      () => {\r\n        count = count + 1\r\n        println(\"obtaining: \" + count)\r\n        count\r\n      },\r\n      Some(_),\r\n      c => {\r\n        println(\"releasing: \" + c)\r\n        count = count - 1\r\n      }\r\n    ).map { c =>\r\n      if(c > 5) {\r\n        println(\"Limit reached!\")\r\n        throw new Exception(\"\")\r\n      } else {\r\n        c * 2\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    .recover { case e => 23 }\r\n  }\r\n// ...\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"patriknw","id":336161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjE2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/336161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw","html_url":"https://github.com/patriknw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/24924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/24924/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
