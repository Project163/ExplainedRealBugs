This was fixed by a modification to OutputStreamSourceStage made by @raboof on Dec 18 2018 (https://github.com/akka/akka/commit/8e0d3e4c96ef64c77f8258284040fbe5e6b19f09) and was marked fixed for 2.5.21. \r\n\r\nHowever, I can see that issue 26136 was fixed by a commit (https://github.com/akka/akka/commit/b0b0865e4ccefa4bd90224b5f4576357a73b27cc#diff-3fc5b08f30cf4755b842061163961132) on Feb 7 which completely changes the class' implementation (and could conceivably have reintroduced the bug).\r\n\r\nWe are seeing (extremely occasional) truncation of output stream responses (i.e. issue #25983) with akka-http 10.1.8 / akka-stream 2.5.23. This is a real issue as the (now useless) response is being (legitimately) cached by an intermediate proxy layer, so this is not observed as a transient issue by our users. Here's the code where I write to an `OutputStream`:\r\n\r\n      def pipe(f: OutputStream => Unit): Source[ByteString, Any] = {\r\n        implicit val ec = blockingIoPool\r\n        import gsa.shared.scala._\r\n\r\n        StreamConverters.asOutputStream(15.seconds).mapMaterializedValue { os =>\r\n          val metered = new CountingOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(os, 2 << 13))\r\n          Future {\r\n            val (_, d) = timed(scala.concurrent.blocking(f(metered)))\r\n            finest(f\"Piped response to query $q to $os in ${d.fractionalMillis}%,1fms\")\r\n            IOResult(metered.getCount, Success(Done))\r\n          }.andThen {\r\n            case _ =>\r\n              try metered.flush() finally metered.close()\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\nI have checked and all `f`s we send to this function `flush` their input anyway. Our logs do not indicate any issues with writing the response stream\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions as to how I may furnish you with any useful information to help you narrow it down?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/28280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/28280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
