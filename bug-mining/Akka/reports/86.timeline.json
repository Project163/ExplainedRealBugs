I think the original behavior was the intended one and should not have been changed. By definition an InputBuffer is in front of a stream component and not after. A Source has no stream component in front of it so changing the InputBuffer attribute should make no difference. That also explains the behavior of putting the attribute after `map` because it changes the `InputBuffer` going *into* map.\r\n\r\nIn general, expecting tight buffer control in akka-stream is usually an anti-pattern and should be used with much consideration. In particular, while you can add explicit asynchronous boundaries (including extra buffers), you cannot be sure that some boundaries like between `fromPublisher` and `map` are added implicitly (including extra buffers).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/comments/1040152504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jrudolph","id":9868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph","html_url":"https://github.com/jrudolph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/comments/1040521115","html_url":"https://github.com/akka/akka-core/issues/30076#issuecomment-1040521115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/30076","id":1040521115,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAH73c4-BReb","user":{"login":"johanandren","id":666915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjkxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/666915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren","html_url":"https://github.com/johanandren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-15T16:54:00Z","updated_at":"2022-02-15T16:54:00Z","body":"I agree that the change was questionable, so maybe we should indeed revert.\r\n\r\nI think I've seen some reports of _other_ usage where tight buffer control has been expected that broke with this change. :/ \r\n\r\nFor the record I think what made me accept trying to fix it was that with `Source.fromPublisher` there is a buffer \"in front\"/inside/between the stream and the publisher making it feel like weird ergonomics that what looks like it would control/set attributes for that operator in fact did not.
