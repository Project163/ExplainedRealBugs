I join like the following.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncluster.join(AddressFromURIString(address))\r\ncluster.subscribe(self, classOf[MemberEvent])\r\n```\r\nSince I join the cluster using `InitialStateAsSnapshot`, I expect only new `MemberEvent` not the old one. But somehow, I am also getting \"past\" events. Forexample `MemberUp` of a node which was already part of the cluster.\r\n\r\n## Expectation:\r\nMy new Akka actor system should join the existing Akka cluster and then it should subscribe to cluster events and should ONLY receive new events (I don't want past events).\r\n\r\nHere is the Github repo with can reproduce the same issue. A readme file is included which gives steps to reproduce the issue.\r\nhttps://github.com/bsikander/akka-cluster-subscribe\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nPlease report issues regarding specific projects in their respective issue trackers, e.g.:\r\n - Akka-HTTP: https://github.com/akka/akka-http/issues \r\n - Alpakka:   https://github.com/akka/alpakka/issues \r\n - Akka Persistence Cassandra Plugin: https://github.com/akka/akka-persistence-cassandra/issues\r\n - ...\r\n\r\nPlease explain your issue precisely, and if possible provide a reproducer snippet (this helps resolve issues much quicker).\r\n\r\nFor general questions and discussion please use https://groups.google.com/group/akka-user/ or https://gitter.im/akka/akka instead.\r\n\r\nThanks, happy hakking!\r\n-->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ktoso","id":120979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDk3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso","html_url":"https://github.com/ktoso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25172/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
