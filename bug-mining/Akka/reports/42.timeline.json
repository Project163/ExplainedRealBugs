`Effect`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25041/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25041/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1735645467,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3MzU2NDU0Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/events/1735645467","actor":{"login":"chbatey","id":1866779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjY3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1866779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey","html_url":"https://github.com/chbatey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b5395a64a37e6b2b67840f8db839f4eceeeae1e2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chbatey/akka/commits/b5395a64a37e6b2b67840f8db839f4eceeeae1e2","created_at":"2018-07-16T15:44:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1735649263,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3MzU2NDkyNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/events/1735649263","actor":{"login":"chbatey","id":1866779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjY3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1866779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey","html_url":"https://github.com/chbatey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"41d94f22bb77620cbe835d410e5b018d2081f5ca","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chbatey/akka/commits/41d94f22bb77620cbe835d410e5b018d2081f5ca","created_at":"2018-07-16T15:45:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"chbatey","id":1866779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjY3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1866779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey","html_url":"https://github.com/chbatey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-16T15:46:14Z","updated_at":"2018-07-16T15:46:14Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25357","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25357/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25357/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25357/events","html_url":"https://github.com/akka/akka-core/pull/25357","id":341574132,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjAxNjc5OTI5","number":25357,"title":"Separate
