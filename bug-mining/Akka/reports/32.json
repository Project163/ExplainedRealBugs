a multi-tenancy context where tenants journals are segregated and where new tenants can sign in after the system has started, it would be great to allow defining the journal and snapshot config at runtime.\r\nThis feature would complete https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/15587 in which configurations can be pre-defined in the reference.conf.\r\nIt would add the ability to fetch the configuration from an external service for example.\r\n\r\nBasically, it would expose two new methods in the `PersistenceIdentity` trait:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * Additional configuration of the journal plugin servicing this persistent actor.\r\n * When empty, the whole configuration of the journal plugin will be taken from the [[Config]] loaded into the\r\n * [[ActorSystem]].\r\n * When
