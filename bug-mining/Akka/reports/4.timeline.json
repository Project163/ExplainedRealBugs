started to implement the `Source.queue[HttpRequest]` pattern mentioned in the docs: http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/scala/http/client-side/host-level.html#examples\r\n\r\nThis is the (reduced) example from the documentation\r\n\r\n    val poolClientFlow = Http()\r\n      .cachedHostConnectionPool[Promise[HttpResponse]](\"akka.io\")\r\n\r\n    val queue =\r\n      Source.queue[(HttpRequest, Promise[HttpResponse])](\r\n         QueueSize, OverflowStrategy.dropNew\r\n      )\r\n        .via(poolClientFlow)\r\n        .toMat(Sink.foreach({\r\n          case ((Success(resp), p)) => p.success(resp)\r\n          case ((Failure(e), p))    => p.failure(e)\r\n        }))(Keep.left)\r\n        .run()\r\n\r\n    def queueRequest(request: HttpRequest): Future[HttpResponse] = {\r\n      val responsePromise = Promise[HttpResponse]()\r\n      queue.offer(request -> responsePromise).flatMap {\r\n        case QueueOfferResult.Enqueued    => responsePromise.future\r\n        case QueueOfferResult.Dropped     => Future.failed(new RuntimeException(\"Queue overflowed. Try again later.\"))\r\n        case QueueOfferResult.Failure(ex) => Future.failed(ex)\r\n        case QueueOfferResult.QueueClosed => Future.failed(new RuntimeException(\"Queue was closed (pool shut down) while running the request. Try again later.\"))\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    val responseFuture: Future[HttpResponse] = queueRequest(HttpRequest(uri = \"/\"))\r\n\r\n\r\nThe docs state that using `Source.single(request)` is an anti-pattern and should be avoid. However it doesn't clarify why and what implications come by using `Source.queue`.\r\n\r\n> At this place we previously showed an example that used the `Source.single(request).via(pool).runWith(Sink.head)`. \r\n> In fact, this is an anti-pattern that doesn’t perform well. Please either supply requests using a queue or in a streamed fashion as shown below.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Advantages of Source.queue\r\n\r\n- The flow is only materialized once ( probably a performance gain? ). However if I understood the akka-http implementation correctly, a new flow is materialized for each connection, so this doesn't seem to be that much of a problem\r\n- Explicit backpressure handling with `OverflowStrategy` and matching over the `QueueOfferResult`\r\n\r\n\r\n# Issues with Source.queue\r\n\r\nThese are the questions that came up, when we started implementing this pattern in our application.\r\n\r\n## Filtering?\r\n\r\nWhat happens when request are being filtered? E.g. when someone changes the implementation \r\n\r\n    Source.queue[(HttpRequest, Promise[HttpResponse])](\r\n        QueueSize, OverflowStrategy.dropNew)\r\n      .via(poolClientFlow)\r\n      // only successful responses\r\n      .filter(_._1.isSuccess)\r\n      // failed won't arrive here\r\n      .to(Sink.foreach({\r\n        case ((Success(resp), p)) => p.success(resp)\r\n        case ((Failure(e), p)) => p.failure(e)\r\n      }))\r\n\r\nWill the Future not resolve? With a single request flow this is straightforward:\r\n\r\n    Source.single(request).via(poolClientFlow).runWith(Sink.headOption)\r\n\r\n## QueueSize vs max-open-request?\r\n\r\nThe difference between the `QueueSize` and `max-open-requests` is not clear. In the end, both are buffers. Our implementation ended up using `QueueSize == max-open-requests`\r\n\r\n# What's the downside for Source.single()?\r\n\r\nUntil now I have found two reasons for using `Source.queue` over `Source.single`\r\n\r\n1. Performance - materializing the flow only once. However according to [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43015133/709351) it shouldn't be an issue\r\n2. Explicitly configuring backpressure and handle failure cases. In my opinion the ConnectionPool has a sufficient handling for too much load. One can map over the resulting future and handle the exceptions.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice that the trade-offs for both approaches would be highlighted in the docs, so as a developer I can choose which fits my needs :)\r\n\r\nThere is also [a related stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44241920/akka-http-host-level-client-side-api-source-queue-pattern) for this. #23081 already addresses the thread-safety issue in the docs.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks in advance,\r\nMuki\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"jrudolph","id":9868,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9868?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph","html_url":"https://github.com/jrudolph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrudolph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-06T13:52:54Z","updated_at":"2017-06-06T13:52:54Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23078","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23078/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23078/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23078/events","html_url":"https://github.com/akka/akka-core/issues/23078","id":232801080,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzI4MDEwODA=","number":23078,"title":"Akka stream Source.queue hangs when using fail overflow strategy","user":{"login":"edrevo","id":1845771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDU3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1845771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo","html_url":"https://github.com/edrevo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edrevo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":92356828,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MjM1NjgyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/labels/1%20-%20triaged","name":"1 -
