It will typically be used in combination with `zipWithIndex` to define the index for the sequence, followed by a `Partition`, followed by the processing of different substreams with different flows (each flow emitting exactly one output for each input), and then merging with this stage, using the index from `zipWithIndex`.\r\n\r\nA more concrete use case is if you're consuming messages from a message broker, and you have a flow that you wish to apply to some messages, but not others, you can partition the message stream according to which should be processed by the flow and which should bypass it, and then bring the messages back together for acknowledgement. If an ordinary merge was used rather than this, the messages that bypass the processing flow would likely overtake the messages going through the processing flow, and the result would be out of order offset acknowledgement which would lead to dropping messages on failure.\r\n\r\nWe're using this in Cloudstate now, we partition the stream based on message type and send it to different streamed gRPC calls, then potentially routed through to an output message broker flow per substream, before being merged back in for acknowledgement.\r\n\r\nI've included a minimal version of the above example in the documentation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/29247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/29247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3452451792,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM0NTI0NTE3OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/events/3452451792","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6b7d4da427c4c30dc40e7454a65a4ee604adaf14","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jroper/akka/commits/6b7d4da427c4c30dc40e7454a65a4ee604adaf14","created_at":"2020-06-17T08:29:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3452511885,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM0NTI1MTE4ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/events/3452511885","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"79f7230c6db0f96ecacd192403c249595b6bed4a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jroper/akka/commits/79f7230c6db0f96ecacd192403c249595b6bed4a","created_at":"2020-06-17T08:44:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3530365145,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzUzMDM2NTE0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/events/3530365145","actor":{"login":"seglo","id":1148412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo","html_url":"https://github.com/seglo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-09T15:52:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3530365702,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM1MzAzNjU3MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/events/3530365702","actor":{"login":"seglo","id":1148412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg0MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo","html_url":"https://github.com/seglo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seglo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.
