Or do we need to enforce any semantics on ordering of side-effects ? e.g. we have `Seq[SideEffect]`, which means the client is free to invoke the side-effects in any order. They may chain them in sequence (monadic) or they may want to apply them in parallel (applicative). Is this the intention ? The ordering is left to the user to decide. But in our implementations do we have any assumption that the side-effects will have to be invoked in sequence ?\r\n\r\nAlso what happens if any of these side-effects throws ?","closed_by":{"login":"ktoso","id":120979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDk3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso","html_url":"https://github.com/ktoso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25042/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25042/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
