We can now gradually, on a page-by-page basis, start merging Java and Scala pages using groups (for example [this page](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/java/guide/tutorial_2.html) has already been set up like this). Switching between Java and Scala (also when generated from the same markdown) will remain a page refresh until we've finished moving everything to groups.\r\n\r\nMerging pages will be quite a bit of work, and this approach allows us to do it step by step.
