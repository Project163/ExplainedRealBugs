I think this one will be the smallest change for now.\r\n\r\nWe can use this as a placeholder  for other doc related things:\r\n* [x] Review docs now that typed actor system has gone. Make sure all still accurate\r\n* [x] Document typed modules\r\n* [ ] Put a note in the akka typed blogs saying that the API / packaging has changed, perhaps update the typed blog code but not the blogs\r\n\r\nList of things still to be documented:\r\n* [ ] Supervision strategy","closed_by":{"login":"chbatey","id":1866779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjY3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1866779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey","html_url":"https://github.com/chbatey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chbatey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/24166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/24166/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
