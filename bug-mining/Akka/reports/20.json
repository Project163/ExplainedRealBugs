Each materialization of the kill-switch logic installs callbacks on the shared promise. As a result, the `SharedKillSwitch` instance has a hard link to all the instances of `KillableGraphStageLogic`. Because graph logic instances link to each other, the SharedKillSwitch prevents the whole graph from being garbage collected. When combined with multiple materialization of a graphs (for example when using a shared kill switch on `Tcp()` connection streams) this causes a memory leak leading to JVM terminating with OutOfMemoryException.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"johanandren","id":666915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjkxNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/666915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren","html_url":"https://github.com/johanandren","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanandren/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23622/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
