A likely fix would be to explicitly call `super.atStartup()` instead (assuming atStartup is defined in a common parent of MultiNodeSpec and MultiNodeClusterSpec), super-calls in traits are virtual, so this should resolve to the atStartup in MultiNodeSpec.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/comments/946643336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smarter","id":63430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarter","html_url":"https://github.com/smarter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smarter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"raboof","id":131856,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTg1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof","html_url":"https://github.com/raboof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raboof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-15T08:09:00Z","updated_at":"2021-11-15T08:09:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/30885","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/30885/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/30885/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/30885/events","html_url":"https://github.com/akka/akka-core/issues/30885","id":1053332267,"node_id":"I_kwDOAAH73c4-yJMr","number":30885,"title":"failed:
