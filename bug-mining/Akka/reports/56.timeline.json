Without it, you need to have a different discovery configuration for every different namespace that you might deploy a service to, for example, this makes the configuration a lot more complex when having different namespaces for test, staging and production environments.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/comments/441854665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1988469036,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE5ODg0NjkwMzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/events/1988469036","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3e7d0469a8ae108f7d496d4045cb33541c486b9f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jroper/akka/commits/3e7d0469a8ae108f7d496d4045cb33541c486b9f","created_at":"2018-11-27T03:27:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-27T03:27:50Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T03:27:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25987","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25987/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25987/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25987/events","html_url":"https://github.com/akka/akka-core/pull/25987","id":384604797,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjMzNzY4MDM3","number":25987,"title":"Async

In this case the search domains are applied for each nameserver attempt, so if a particular nameserver times out, it won't attempt to search any more domains on that nameserver.\n\nThe second part is in actually detecting the system configuration. I've only implemented partial support here, it reads /etc/resolv.conf, and nothing else. There are ways to detect it on other platforms, there are also environment variables that are supposed to be honored on Linux and other *nix's, but to keep this change manageable, I've focussed on just supporting the minimum to meet the Kubernetes service discovery use case, and documented the limitations.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25987/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/comments/441888486","html_url":"https://github.com/akka/akka-core/issues/25825#issuecomment-441888486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/25825","id":441888486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTg4ODQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-27T03:28:26Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T03:28:26Z","body":"Implemented

#24\r\n\r\nThis implements per service mapping of service name, port, protocol and scheme.\r\n\r\nThe `ServiceNameParser` has been renamed to `ServiceNameMapper`, because that's now what it essentially does, maps a Lagom service name to an Akka discover lookup, plus scheme. It first attempts to do the mapping via direct configuration. If there's no mapping there, it then attempts to do the mapping parsing it using the regex, and if that yields no mapping, then it just uses the service name as is with the configured default port, protocol and mapped scheme.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lagom/lagom-akka-discovery-service-locator/issues/28/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lagom/lagom-akka-discovery-service-locator/issues/28/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
