Similarly, closing a ServerSocketChannel that is registered with Selector will now consistently delay closing the underlying listener socket until it is flushed from all selectors that it is registered with. The behavior varied by platform in previous releases. Developers using tools such as netstat to monitor network connection should be aware of this change, particularly with libraries or applications that do not perform selection operations in a timely manner to flush closed channels from selectors.\r\n\r\nBefore this change the following guarantee was given (at least de facto on Linux):\r\n\r\nWhen the call from `SocketChannel.close` returned:\r\n\r\n 1. The JVM part of the socket really was closed\r\n 2. The OS socket was closed (as observable by netstat)\r\n 3. On localhost also the peer had reliably detected closing of the socket (over the network this isn't true necessarily).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we had the invariant that the TcpConnection was stopped completely only after the channel had been closed. This was implemented using its `postStop` and could be observed using actor watching. In other words, when you received a `Terminated` for a connection actor you knew that the associated channel was closed before.\r\n\r\nWe (and potentially also user code) relies on this for several purposes:\r\n\r\n * In Akka IO, we immediately return an acknowledgement message after closing (`Unbound` for listening sockets, one of the `CloseEvent` for connected sockets).\r\n * Especially for listening sockets the assumption is that once you have received `Unbound` you can rebind the socket (needs guarantee 2).\r\n * In tests we often rely on guarantee 3 to check the effect of closing a connection.\r\n\r\nWith JDK 11, the behavior has changed and the (asynchronous) channel is effectively only closed after it has been removed from its `Selector` which might only happen when a call from `selector.select` has returned the next time.\r\n\r\nWe need to decide which part of the semantics to retain also for JDK 11. Especially hard to maintain is the invariant that closing of a channel happens-before terminating the associated TcpConnection actor because the closing code may happen only in `postStop` where we cannot synchronously block until the selector has finally completed the channel
