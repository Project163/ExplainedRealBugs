Once a kill-switch is activated, any subsequent requests for a shutdown future will return an already complete future.\r\n\r\nThe synchronization is limited to the private helper class. The synchronization guards only the shutdown signal and creation of a new promise. In other words, there is no synchronization inside the flow, so the normal performance should not be impacted.\r\n\r\nThis code uses synchronization, so it must be reviewed with extreme prejudice!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23623/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1244851930,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEyNDQ4NTE5MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/events/1244851930","actor":{"login":"ktoso","id":120979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDk3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso","html_url":"https://github.com/ktoso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktoso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-12T09:02:33Z","label":{"name":"3
