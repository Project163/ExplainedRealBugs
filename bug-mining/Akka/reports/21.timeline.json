Here it should immediately do cross-dc gossip to DC1, since it has no peers in DC2. Don't know if it's too much to treat that case as probability 1.0.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of a hard coded adjustment algorithm based on number of nodes in own DC. A simple such could be to just use 0.5 when size (in own DC) is < 5, as you suggest.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/comments/340764178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"patriknw","id":336161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjE2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/336161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw","html_url":"https://github.com/patriknw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/comments/340765425","html_url":"https://github.com/akka/akka-core/issues/23803#issuecomment-340765425","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/akka/akka-core/issues/23803","id":340765425,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MDc2NTQyNQ==","user":{"login":"patriknw","id":336161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjE2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/336161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw","html_url":"https://github.com/patriknw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patriknw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-31T13:41:29Z","updated_at":"2017-10-31T13:41:29Z","body":"noticing another thing;
