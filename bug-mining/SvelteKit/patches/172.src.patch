 Without an argument, `use:enhance` will emulate the browser-native behaviour, just without the full-page reloads. It will:
 
-- update the `form` property and `$page.form` and invalidate all data on a successful response
-- update the `form` property and `$page.form` on a invalid response
-- update `$page.status` on a successful or invalid response
+- update the `form` property, `$page.form` and `$page.status` on a successful or invalid response, but only if the action is on the same page you're submitting from. So for example if your form looks like `<form action="/somewhere/else" ..>`, `form` and `$page` will _not_ be updated. This is because in the native form submission case you would be redirected to the page the action is on.
+- invalidate all data using `invalidateAll` on a successful response
 - call `goto` on a redirect response
 - render the nearest `+error` boundary if an error occurs
 
-> By default the `form` property and `$page.form` is only updated for actions that are in a `+page.server.js` alongside the `+page.svelte` because in the native form submission case you would be redirected to the page the action is on

 The behaviour of `applyAction(result)` depends on `result.type`:
 
-- `success`, `invalid` — sets `$page.status` to `result.status` and updates `form` and `$page.form` to `result.data`
+- `success`, `invalid` — sets `$page.status` to `result.status` and updates `form` and `$page.form` to `result.data` (regardless of where you are submitting from, in contrast to `update` from `enhance`)
 - `redirect` — calls `goto(result.location)`
 - `error` — renders the nearest `+error` boundary with `result.error`
