 You can control each of these on a page-by-page basis by exporting options from [`+page.js`](/docs/routing#page-page-js) or [`+page.server.js`](/docs/routing#page-page-server-js), or for groups of pages using a shared [`+layout.js`](/docs/routing#layout-layout-js) or [`+layout.server.js`](/docs/routing#layout-layout-server-js). To define an option for the whole app, export it from the root layout. Child layouts and pages override values set in parent layouts, so — for example — you can enable prerendering for your entire app then disable it for pages that need to be dynamically rendered.
 
+You can mix and match these options in different areas of your app. For example you could prerender your marketing page for maximum speed, server-render your dynamic pages for SEO and accessibility and turn your admin section into an SPA by rendering it on the client only. This makes SvelteKit very versatile.

 ### prerender
 
 It's likely that at least some routes of your app can be represented as a simple HTML file generated at build time. These routes can be [_prerendered_](/docs/appendix#prerendering).

-Normally, SvelteKit renders your page on the server first and sends that HTML to the client where it's hydrated. If you set `ssr` to `false`, it renders an empty 'shell' page instead.

 ### csr
 
 Ordinarily, SvelteKit [hydrates](/docs/appendix#hydration) your server-rendered HTML into an interactive client-side-rendered (CSR) page. Some pages don't require JavaScript at all — many blog posts and 'about' pages fall into this category. In these cases you can disable CSR:
