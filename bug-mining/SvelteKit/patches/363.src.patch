 By default, `adapter-static` checks that either all pages and endpoints (if any) of your app were prerendered, or you have the `fallback` option set. This check exists to prevent you from accidentally publishing an app where some parts of it are not accessible, because they are not contained in the final output. If you know this is ok (for example when a certain page only exists conditionally), you can set `strict` to `false` to turn off this check.

-
-You can also turn only part of your app into an SPA by [disabling prerendering](#spa-mode-turn-off-prerendering) only for those pages.
-
-Let's go through these options one by one:
-
-### Add fallback page
-
-The fallback page is an HTML page created by SvelteKit from your page template (e.g. `app.html`) that loads your app and navigates to the correct route. For example [Surge](https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-200-page-for-client-side-routing), a static web host, lets you add a `200.html` file that will handle any requests that don't correspond to static assets or prerendered pages. We can create that file like so:
-
-```js
-// @errors: 2307
-/// file: svelte.config.js
-import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';
-
-export default {
-	kit: {
-		adapter: adapter({
-			fallback: '200.html'
-		})
-	}
-};
-```
-
-> How to configure this behaviour does however depend on your hosting solution and is not part of SvelteKit. It is recommended to search the host's documentation on how to redirect requests.
-
-### Turn off prerendering
-
-When operating in SPA mode, you can omit the [`prerender`](page-options#prerender) option from your root layout (or set it to `false`, its default value), and only pages that have the `prerender` option set will be prerendered at build time.
-
-SvelteKit will still crawl your app's entry points looking for prerenderable pages. If `vite build` fails because of pages that can't be loaded outside the browser, you can set `config.kit.prerender.entries` to `[]` to prevent this from happening.
-
-You can also add turn off prerendering only to parts of your app, if you want other parts to be prerendered.
-
-### Turn off ssr
-
-During development, SvelteKit will still attempt to server-side render your routes. This means accessing things that are only available in the browser (such as the `window` object) will result in errors, even though this would be valid in the output app. To align the behavior of SvelteKit's dev mode with your SPA, you can add [`export const ssr = false`](page-options#ssr) to your root `+layout`. You can also add this option only to parts of your app, if you want other parts to be prerendered.
-
-### Apache
-
-To run an SPA on [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), you should add a `static/.htaccess` file to route requests to the fallback page:
-
-```
-<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
-	RewriteEngine On
-	RewriteBase /
-	RewriteRule ^200\.html$ - [L]
-	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
-	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
-	RewriteRule . /200.html [L]
-</IfModule>
-```

 ## GitHub Pages
 
 When building for GitHub Pages, make sure to update [`paths.base`](configuration#paths) to match your repo name, since the site will be served from <https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name> rather than from the root.

+title: Single-page apps
+---
+
+You can turn any SvelteKit app, using any adapter, into a fully client-rendered single-page app (SPA) by disabling SSR at the root layout:
+
+```js
+/// file: src/routes/+layout.js
+export const ssr = false;
+```
+
+> In most situations this is not recommended: it harms SEO, tends to slow down perceived performance, and makes your app inaccessible to users if JavaScript fails or is disabled (which happens [more often than you probably think](https://kryogenix.org/code/browser/everyonehasjs.html)).
+
+If you don't have any server-side logic (i.e. `+page.server.js`, `+layout.server.js` or `+server.js` files) you can use [`adapter-static`](adapter-static) to create your SPA by adding a _fallback page_.
+
+## Usage
+
+Install with `npm i -D @sveltejs/adapter-static`, then add the adapter to your `svelte.config.js` with the following options:
+
+```js
+// @errors: 2307
+/// file: svelte.config.js
+import adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-static';
+
+export default {
+	kit: {
+		adapter: adapter({
+			fallback: '200.html' // may differ from host to host
+		})
+	}
+};
+```
+
+The `fallback` page is an HTML page created by SvelteKit from your page template (e.g. `app.html`) that loads your app and navigates to the correct route. For example [Surge](https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-200-page-for-client-side-routing), a static web host, lets you add a `200.html` file that will handle any requests that don't correspond to static assets or prerendered pages.
+
+On some hosts it may be `index.html` or something else entirely — consult your platform's documentation.
+
+## Apache
+
+To run an SPA on [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), you should add a `static/.htaccess` file to route requests to the fallback page:
+
+```
+<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
+	RewriteEngine On
+	RewriteBase /
+	RewriteRule ^200\.html$ - [L]
+	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
+	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
+	RewriteRule . /200.html [L]
+</IfModule>
+```
+
+## Prerendering individual pages
+
+If you want certain pages to be prerendered, you can re-enable `ssr` alongside `prerender` for just those parts of your app:
+
+```js
+/// file: src/routes/my-prerendered-page/+page.js
+export const prerender = true;
+export const ssr = true;
+```

 A single-page app (SPA) is an application in which all requests to the server load a single HTML file which then does client-side rendering of the requested contents based on the requested URL. All navigation is handled on the client-side in a process called client-side routing with per-page contents being updated and common layout elements remaining largely unchanged. SPAs do not provide SSR, which has the shortcoming described above. However, some applications are not greatly impacted by these shortcomings such as a complex business application behind a login where SEO would not be important and it is known that users will be accessing the application from a consistent computing environment.
