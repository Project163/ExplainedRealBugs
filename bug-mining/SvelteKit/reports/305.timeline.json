Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8508/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8223674194,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5ZFM0tzwAAAAHqK09S","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8223674194","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-13T19:09:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8223674390,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5ZFM0tzwAAAAHqK1AW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8223674390","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6c7f9b201e5b70f456e5f34d43b9380ffa907db6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/6c7f9b201e5b70f456e5f34d43b9380ffa907db6","created_at":"2023-01-13T19:09:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/2412625451","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/8127#issuecomment-2412625451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8127","id":2412625451,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c6Pzb4r","user":{"login":"jdgamble555","id":8333090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzMwOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8333090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdgamble555","html_url":"https://github.com/jdgamble555","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdgamble555/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdgamble555/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdgamble555/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdgamble555/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdgamble555/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdgamble555/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdgamble555/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdgamble555/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdgamble555/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-15T01:17:55Z","updated_at":"2024-10-15T01:17:55Z","body":"The
