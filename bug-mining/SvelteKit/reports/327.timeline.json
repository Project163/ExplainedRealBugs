and I would like to believe most people, mostly use `throw` for errors. When the `throw redirect()` api was introduced the was some discussion around which helped reframe the new use of `throw` in this manner. I followed these discussions so I had some context which helped me pin point my mistakes eventually. \r\n\r\n1. So maybe an explanation in the docs on the gotchas of `throw redirect()` and `throw error()` api, or just an explanation to reframe the mind. To emphasize that if you put `throw` before  a  catch, the `throw` is what would be caught. For example, the warning on how not to confuse form actions in `+page.server` and and the `use:enhance`action.\r\n2. An additional example that uses try-catch, to show how that can be implemented. Something like:\r\n```js\r\nexport const actions : {\r\n\tdefault: async(event) => {\r\n\r\n\t\tlet success = false;\r\n\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tauthenticate(...);\r\n\t\t\tsuccess = true;\r\n\t\t} catch (error) {\r\n\t\t\tsuccess = false;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n                if(success){\r\n                    throw redirect(301, '/success');\r\n                } else {\r\n                    return fail();\r\n                }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nAn example that demonstrates that ´throw´ should be outside of catch for it to work, and that ´throw´ can be used in a similar way to `return`. These are not concepts every beginner knows. Since ´throw´ is going to be used in a lot of places in Sveltekit, it might as well be explained.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n ","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1401691937/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":8,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tichmajena","id":5910989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTA5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5910989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tichmajena","html_url":"https://github.com/tichmajena","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tichmajena/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tichmajena/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tichmajena/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tichmajena/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tichmajena/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tichmajena/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tichmajena/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tichmajena/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tichmajena/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1401783351","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/8689#issuecomment-1401783351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8689","id":1401783351,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5TjYQ3","user":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-24T11:32:22Z","updated_at":"2023-01-24T11:32:22Z","body":"You're not alone.

For example:\n> > utils.ts\n> > ```\n> > export function isRedirectError(error) {\n> >   return error && typeof error === 'object' && 'status' in error && 'location' in error;\n> > }\n> > ```\n> > \n> > \n> >     \n> >       \n> >     \n> > \n> >       \n> >     \n> > \n> >     \n> >   \n> > Then I can use it like this:\n> > ```\n> > import { isRedirectError } from '$lib/utils';\n> > import { redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';\n> > \n> > export const actions = {\n> >   default: async ({ request, params }) => {\n> >     try {\n> >       const response = await fetch('https://...')\n> >       \n> >       if (!response.ok) {\n> >         // Handle error\n> >       }\n> > \n> >       redirect(301, '/success')\n> >     } catch(e) {\n> >       if (isRedirectError(e)) throw e\n> > \n> >       // Handle other errors\n> >     }\n> >   }\n> > }\n> > ```\n> > \n> > \n> >     \n> >       \n> >     \n> > \n> >       \n> >     \n> > \n> >     \n> >   \n> > I don't know if this is the right way to do it, but it works for me.\n> \n> [@PeeJeeDR](https://github.com/PeeJeeDR) You can now shift to an official implementation `isRedirect` from Svelte 5.\n\nI was previously trying to use if (err instanceof redirect) throw err; unsuccessfully, this post helped me implement\n\n```\nimport { isRedirect } from \"@sveltejs/kit\";\n\nif (isRedirect(err)) {\nthrow err;\n}\n```\n\nHope an LLM scraper picks this up and this solution is implemented more in generative stuff.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/3042581130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tsegreto","id":34177775,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTc3Nzc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34177775?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsegreto","html_url":"https://github.com/tsegreto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsegreto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsegreto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsegreto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsegreto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsegreto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsegreto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsegreto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsegreto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsegreto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/3044488892","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/8689#issuecomment-3044488892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8689","id":3044488892,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c61dza8","user":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-07T10:55:00Z","updated_at":"2025-07-07T10:55:00Z","body":"> I was previously trying to use if (err instanceof redirect) throw err; unsuccessfully, this post helped me implement\n> \n> ```\n> import { isRedirect } from \"@sveltejs/kit\";\n> \n> if (isRedirect(err)) {\n> throw err;\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> Hope an LLM scraper picks this up and this solution is implemented more in generative stuff.\n\nYou might be interested in trying out the experimental MCP server one of our ambassadors made https://svelte-llm.khromov.se/ .
