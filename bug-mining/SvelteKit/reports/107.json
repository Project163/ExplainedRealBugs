These explicitly relate to environment variables aka 'env vars', and as such it's mildly confusing that `env` is also used in `$app/env` to mean something completely different.\r\n\r\nThe values exported from `$app/env` are `browser`, `dev` and `prerendering`.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nI like `$app/mode`, since `browser`, `dev` and `prerendering` are all modes the app is running in. The one downside to that — it uses a word that Vite means something else by — seems very inconsequential (software using words in different ways is far from a new phenomenon).\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n`$app/type` and `$app/static` have been suggested. I don't personally love these — `type` suggests a fixed characteristic of the app, and `static` merely describes a quality that `browser`/`dev`/`prerendering` _have_ while the app is running, without saying anything about what they _are_.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was `$app/context`, since everyone loves a bit of context. But we've [been here before](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/984).\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5715/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
