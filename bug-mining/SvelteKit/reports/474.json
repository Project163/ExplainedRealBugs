So it seems like somehow the keys gets mixed up in the build. I suspect introduced in https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/12700\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Create a new sveltekit project, and make a build\r\n2. Take note of the variable name `globalThis.__sveltekit_*` in `client/_app/immutable/chunks/entry.*.js `\r\n3. Make a change to package.json, for example add a new dependency\r\n4. Make new build, notice that the `entry.*.js` file has not changed filename (same key), but that `globalThis.__sveltekit_*` has changed key, so the file has become mutable\r\n\r\nThe build is still valid by itself, but if application is served behind a cdn, the old file will be served since filename doesnt change.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 14.6.1\r\n    CPU: (12) arm64 Apple M2 Max\r\n    Memory: 2.38 GB / 64.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 20.15.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.15.1/bin/node\r\n    npm: 10.7.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.15.1/bin/npm\r\n    pnpm: 9.1.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v20.15.1/bin/pnpm\r\n    bun: 1.1.5 - ~/.bun/bin/bun\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 129.0.6668.90\r\n    Safari: 17.6\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: 5.2.5 => 5.2.5 \r\n    @sveltejs/enhanced-img: 0.3.8 => 0.3.8 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 2.6.3 => 2.6.3 \r\n    svelte: 4.2.19 => 4.2.19 \r\n    vite: 5.4.8 => 5.4.8\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nblocking an upgrade\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12771/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
