Issue is that by using `^/.*$` regex in the manifest.json you will catch _all_ the request and pipe them through Sveltekit. With lambda functions this is fine, and `/.netlify/*` doesn't get caught.\r\n\r\n(I opened at Netlify's forum but their soution is a bit overcomplicated imho: https://answers.netlify.com/t/how-to-use-netlify-identity-with-edge-functions-sveltekit/75634)\r\n\r\nI wrote a very dirty solution for it. I'm replacing the regex pattern created by the adapter to `^/[^.].*$`. This way all the routes starting with `.` will not get caught by the edge function. This awful solution comes with a caveat that the aformentioned regex excludes `/` too... So unless you prerender the home page anyway this would break your app. There might be a better regex for this but since edge functions doesn't support look aheads I couldn't think of a better one. (https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/create-integration/#generate-declarations)\r\n\r\nHere is how I did this with a onBuild build plugin:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { readFile, writeFile } from 'fs/promises'\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Keep /.netlify/* endpoints getting caught by edge function pattern\r\n */\r\nexport const onBuild = async function ({ build }) {\r\n\ttry {\r\n\t\tconst file = await readFile('.netlify/edge-functions/manifest.json', {encoding: 'utf8'}).then(s => JSON.parse(s))\r\n\t\t// https://regex101.com/r/ldVrTI/1\r\n\t\t// This will actually ignore all routes starting with \".\". => /.*/*\r\n\t\tfile.functions[0].pattern = '^/[^.].*$'\r\n\t\tawait writeFile('.netlify/edge-functions/manifest.json', JSON.stringify(file))\r\n\t} catch (err) {\r\n\t\tbuild.failBuild(err)\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1407508170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adamjkb","id":32829904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODI5OTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32829904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjkb","html_url":"https://github.com/adamjkb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjkb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjkb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjkb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjkb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjkb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjkb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjkb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjkb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adamjkb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1408350187","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5235#issuecomment-1408350187","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5235","id":1408350187,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5T8bfr","user":{"login":"ascorbic","id":213306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbic","html_url":"https://github.com/ascorbic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ascorbic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-30T10:21:19Z","updated_at":"2023-01-30T10:21:19Z","body":"We're adding support for negative matchers.

#5235.\r\n\r\nWhen using edge functions with Netlify, the generated edge function was configured to run against all paths. This conflicted with the expectation that paths under `.netlify/` (such as `.netlify/identity/settings`) are ignored by the framework.\r\n\r\nAt the time #5235 was opened, this was difficult to solve, but Netlify now supports path exclusions in edge function configuration, hence this PR.\r\n\r\nWhile I was here, I also added an exclusion to avoid unnecessarily invoking this edge function on static files. Currently it's [just a no-op](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/80386437030c5c79913e859e3c32fd194613e1b6/packages/adapter-netlify/src/edge.js#L18-L22), but it's still nice to avoid the unnecessary invocation.\r\n\r\nTesting this is a bit involved, but I was able to repro the issue in #5235 and to confirm this fixes it. We should probably add proper integration tests here eventually.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`.
