It's possible to force an invalidation with `invalidate(resource)` (where the `load` function called `depends(resource)`) or with `invalidate()` (which invalidates _all_ `load` functions), but it's not possible to opt _out_ of invalidation, which is occasionally helpful:\r\n\r\n* you want to log some values but not 'observe' them\r\n* you want to implement more fine-grained invalidation, a la #5850\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nWe could add an `untrack` function to `load`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport function load({ params, untrack }) {\r\n  untrack(() => console.log(`this will not re-run when ${params.foo}` changes...`));\r\n  console.log(`...but it will re-run when ${params.bar} changes`);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCode executed synchronously inside the callback would not affect the function's dependencies.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe alternative is to require developers to be completely explicit about when `load` should re-run, or to _always_ re-run every `load` function (which no-one wants).\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6294/reactions","total_count":29,"+1":29,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6294/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
