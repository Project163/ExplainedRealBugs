https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/13287\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the client-side external link evaluation so that when using the hash router, accessing `/index.html` is considered an internal link. This prevents the page from reloading infinitely because the router incorrectly considered `/index.html` an external link.\r\n\r\nThere's also a slight doc change. Instead of suggesting all links start with `/#/`, suggesting links start with `#` allows the router to preserve the `/index.html` pathname. For example, links to `/about` should be `#/about` instead of `/#/about` so that it navigates to `/index.html#/about`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked.
