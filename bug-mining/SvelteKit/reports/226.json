Describe the problem\r\n\r\nSometimes, I just want to create \"side effects\" from visiting a route: \r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// +layout.ts\r\nimport { crumbsStore } from '$lib/components/Breadcrumb';\r\nimport type { LayoutLoad } from './$types';\r\n\r\nexport const load: LayoutLoad = () => {\r\n\tcrumbsStore.addCrumb({ path: '/data-analytics/operations', name: 'Operations', enabled: true });\r\n\r\n\treturn {\r\n\t\tpageTitle: 'Operations',\r\n\t};\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, there doesn't need to be any `+layout.svelte`, because all I want to do is add my `pageTitle` to the rolled-up `data` object (which my root layout is listening to, setting the page's Title) and add a breadcrumb to a store (which is how my `Breadcrumb` component works). Right now, I have to create a `+layout.svelte` with only `<slot />` as the content, or nothing will be rendered on or under this route. That seems kind of silly.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nWhen a `+layout.ts` or a `+layout.server.ts` exists but there isn't any `+layout.svelte`, Kit should just inject a default `+layout.svelte` containing an empty slot.\r\n\r\nNote: If we went this route, we'd have to make an update to how we're generating types, as currently `+layout.ts` and `+layout.server.ts` don't get their types generated if there's no `+layout.svelte`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nJust live with the extra files 🤷🏻 \r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nnice to have\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5967/reactions","total_count":28,"+1":28,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5967/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
