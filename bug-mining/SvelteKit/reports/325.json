Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI have a monorepo which shares a base tsconfig and I want sveltekit to extend it.\r\nHowever the root sveltekit tsconfig extends `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` and I cannot modify `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` to extend my  base tsconfig because it gets overridden by the auto-generation.\r\nSo from what I understand my only choice if I want to extend my base tsconfig is to lose the autogenerated one ?\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nCreate a turborepo app and create a sveltekit app inside the app folder.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nLinux\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI created this package to be able to extend multiple tsconfigs:
