However, at least on the surface, the div seems redundant and unnecessary, and the app continues to work even if you remove it and make `%sveltekit.body%` a direct child of `<body>`, yet it feels like it must been been put there for a reason.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nThe first question of course, is why this `div` even exists and what purpose it exactly serves; and also whether or not it's safe to remove it. I think it would be helpful if these questions were answered in the documentation. Although this may sound like a small detail, it could cause confusion for some people as it has for me (I've seen it being asked about a few times in the Discord server). Especially if the `div` is in fact necessary for the proper functioning of the app, some people may remove it without realizing that. So either way, this could benefit from some documentation, I feel.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I'd appreciate it if some explanation were provided in this issue, so that in the future if somebody else has this question mark in their head, and they search for it, they can hopefully find this issue and read the explanation here.\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nnice to have\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6244/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
