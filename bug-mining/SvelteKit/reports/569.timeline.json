#14688 \r\n\r\nChanges `.allIssues()` from `{ message: string }` to the following to indicate where in the field container the issue occurred.\r\n\r\n[Demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltekit-template-sjtkof-nqdcvq3u?file=package.json,src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.svelte)\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface RemoteFormAllIssue {\r\n\tmessage: string;\r\n  path: Array<string | number>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the issue shows, this can be used to group issues with `Object.groupBy()`.\r\n\r\n### Discriminated Unions\r\n\r\n#14771 was a big step forward to being able to work with discriminated union schemas. However, you still can't get the issues for a field in a D.U. Having access to the path here would be the final thing needed to support D.U. schemas. You still can't use `.as()` or `.issues()`, but you can set the attributes manually like this:\r\n\r\n[Discriminated Union Demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltekit-template-sjtkof-cvvrlrax?file=src%2Froutes%2Fschema.ts,src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.svelte)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14784/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14784/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20435443412,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c7Q3OggzwAAAATCDB7U","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/20435443412","actor":{"login":"vladshcherbin","id":6711845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTE4NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6711845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladshcherbin","html_url":"https://github.com/vladshcherbin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladshcherbin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladshcherbin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladshcherbin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladshcherbin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladshcherbin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladshcherbin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladshcherbin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladshcherbin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladshcherbin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-22T16:33:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20565496668,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c7Q3OggzwAAAATJzJNc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/20565496668","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-28T22:01:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20565496740,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c7Q3OggzwAAAATJzJOk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/20565496740","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2ccc63806fa4049c0c05ebc43dce8905e355ed5a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/2ccc63806fa4049c0c05ebc43dce8905e355ed5a","created_at":"2025-10-28T22:01:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
