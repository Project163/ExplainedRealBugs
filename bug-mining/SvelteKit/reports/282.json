It is thus missing single quotes which seems to be required according to the MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/require-trusted-types-for\r\n\r\nI believe this could be because \"script\" is not included in the `quoted` Set here: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/c60e957142f7424342772500de2339475dfe7f19/packages/kit/src/runtime/server/page/csp.js#L164-L168 but I'm not familiar enough with the codebase to say so with certainty, and I'm also not sure if simply adding \"script\" to the `quoted` list is going to work -- or if it's going to cause other issues.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nReprodution: https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-2q4dhx?file=svelte.config.js\r\n\r\n1. Add `require-trusted-types-for: ['script']` directive to CSP config\r\n2. Reload page and verify content-security-policy response header shows `require-trusted-types-for script` (missing single quotes in script)\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.15 Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 22.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6600K CPU @ 3.50GHz\r\n    Memory: 23.35 GB / 31.28 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /usr/bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.15.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.5.5 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 107.1.45.116\r\n    Chromium: 106.0.5249.119\r\n    Firefox: 106.0.2\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: ^1.0.0-next.98 => 1.0.0-next.98 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.0.0-next.516 => 1.0.0-next.516 \r\n    svelte: ^3.52.0 => 3.52.0 \r\n    vite: ^3.1.8 => 3.1.8 \r\n```\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7442/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7442/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
