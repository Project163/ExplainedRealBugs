fixes #8438 by moving the refocus until after the rerender of the new page, so that old autofocus elements that will be removed are not focussed. It only calls focus if no manual focus by the user is detected.\r\n- fixes #8439 by waiting for removeAllRanges() to be fired. This can't be tested through Playwright because there's no way to say \"type something but don't focus the input before that\"\r\n- moves one test to deduplicate describe groups\r\n\r\nIn general I'd like to confirm that moving the focus management after `await tick()` doesn't break anything that isn't already covered by tests. I moved it and an additional check ensure we don't refocus when we shouldn't because someone already did it manually.

For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts.
