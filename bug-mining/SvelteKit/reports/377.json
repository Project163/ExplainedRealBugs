Run `pnpm build && pnpm preview`\r\n2.

Netlify implements its own trailing slash redirect logic as the adapter has none and we can tell SvelteKit isn't handling it because it omits the `x-sveltekit-normalise` header in the redirect.\r\nhttps://whimsical-croquembouche-bf1ae0.netlify.app/test/\r\n2. `adapter-cloudflare` should allow sveltekit to handle it instead of the logic I implemented [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/089c405041b0267356281fc8ea5f19ecc331178b/packages/adapter-cloudflare/src/worker.js#L62).\r\n3. `adapter-vercel` is unaffected because it uses static redirects from a vercel config file (`adapter-cloudflare` should do the same to bypass worker runs but that's for another day).\r\n4. `adapter-node` currently never reaches `server.respond` because the handler before it doesn't differentiate between `about.html` and `about/index.html`.\r\n5. Not sure which community adapters are affected by this.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8839/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8839/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
