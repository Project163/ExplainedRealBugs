#5074, by increasing the fidelity of the server-side `fetch` implementation passed to `load`.

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6550/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7317768765,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5Ka0L5zwAAAAG0LEo9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7317768765","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-04T01:36:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7317768783,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5Ka0L5zwAAAAG0LEpP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7317768783","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e3c34a7c6f863abff6ba3f0e7b91c68b47d1489f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/e3c34a7c6f863abff6ba3f0e7b91c68b47d1489f","created_at":"2022-09-04T01:36:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1238336297","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5074#issuecomment-1238336297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5074","id":1238336297,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5Jz4Mp","user":{"login":"bummzack","id":1006185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYxODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1006185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bummzack","html_url":"https://github.com/bummzack","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bummzack/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bummzack/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bummzack/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bummzack/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bummzack/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bummzack/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bummzack/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bummzack/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bummzack/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-06T15:50:24Z","updated_at":"2022-09-06T15:50:24Z","body":"We seem to get this new simulated CORS error a lot on netlify deploys.
