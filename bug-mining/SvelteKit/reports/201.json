Entering a guess and hitting Enter produces the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUnexpected token 'C', \"Cross-site\"... is not valid JSON\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because `sverdle?/enter` returns \"Cross-site POST form submissions are forbidden\"\n\n### Reproduction\n\nGo to sveltekit.new, go to Sverdle, enter a guess, and hit enter. The error will be displayed.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.0 undefined\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 0 Bytes / 0 Bytes\r\n    Shell: 1.0 - /bin/jsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.2 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.10 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 7.17.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.83 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.516 \r\n    svelte: ^3.46.0 => 3.52.0 \r\n    vite: ^3.1.0 => 3.1.8\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nIn Discord, Rich suggested that maybe have a branch where CSRF protection is disabled specifically for the sveltekit.new demo. We want to keep it enabled in the normal demo case.","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7277/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
