This is quite problematic for custom `trailingSlash` handling in the load function.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n- `/myroute/` server load gives pathname: `/myroute/` (ok)\r\n- `/myroute/` client load gives pathname: `/myroute` (not ok)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nPlease note that `trailingSlash` is set to `ignore`. Click both links and see the problem when viewing a page with a trailing slash.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-y3g4ee?file=src/routes/about/+page.svelte\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.22621\r\n    CPU: (12) x64 AMD Ryzen 5 5600U with Radeon Graphics\r\n    Memory: 2.41 GB / 13.86 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.15.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    npm: 9.6.3 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Edge: Spartan (44.22621.1413.0), Chromium (111.0.1661.62)\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.22621.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: 1.2.3 => 1.2.3\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.15.0 => 1.15.0\r\n    svelte: 3.58.0 => 3.58.0\r\n    vite: 4.2.1 => 4.2.1\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9595/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
