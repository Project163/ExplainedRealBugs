This has the added benefit of always rendering a unique version. The downside of this is that this gets passed on and hardcoded in the singletons.js during a build. Consequently making the singletons.hash.js unique to each build. If your hosting does not \"share\" build assets while scaling horizontally this creates a problem in that you get 404's (each container has a unique set of files).\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. install sveltekit\r\n2. run a build\r\n3. rename output folder (to prevent overwriting it)\r\n4. run a second build (without any code changes)\r\n5. observe that build/_app/immutable/chunks/singletons-[hash].js is now different from the previous build\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.6\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Pro\r\n    Memory: 106.39 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.16.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.16.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /opt/homebrew/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.11.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.16.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 105.1.43.93\r\n    Chrome: 105.0.5195.125\r\n    Firefox Developer Edition: 106.0\r\n    Safari: 16.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-static: ^1.0.0-next.42 => 1.0.0-next.43\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.491\r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.50.1\r\n    vite: ^3.1.3 => 3.1.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nPerhaps the singletons could uses a pointer to the version, and not a hardcoded version?\r\n\r\nthe original code can be found here:\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/src/runtime/client/utils.js#L140\r\nwhich gets its contents from here:\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/src/exports/vite/build/utils.js#L136\r\n\r\nCC @s-rd","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7144/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7144/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
