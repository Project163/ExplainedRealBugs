When loading some data _once_ in a parent __layout I expected that data to then remain static. But the props appear to be re-assigned on every navigation, even for querystring parameter changes. This plays havoc with any `use:actions` which think things have been updated when they haven't (which may contain image gallery layout code, canvas setup etc... that I only want to re-run when the data actually changes)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSimplified example to show the behavior:\r\nhttps://github.com/CaptainCodeman/sveltekit-layout-props-example\r\n\r\nRun the project and navigate around. Note the prop changes and action update console logs, even though the `load` function has only executed once:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"484\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-06-22 at 12 38 08 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/304910/175111993-c175289f-cdb8-4146-ad68-cc045420c05a.png\">\r\n\r\nI wouldn't expect the `data` prop to keep changing or for the `use:action` to keep being updated, but they are in both the __layout and an imported component.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.4\r\n    CPU: (6) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8500B CPU @ 3.00GHz\r\n    Memory: 335.20 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.3.1 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 102.1.39.111\r\n    Chrome: 102.0.5005.115\r\n    Chrome Canary: 105.0.5134.0\r\n    Edge: 102.0.1245.41\r\n    Firefox: 101.0.1\r\n    Safari: 15.5\r\n    Safari Technology Preview: 16.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-static: next => 1.0.0-next.34 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.352 \r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.48.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
