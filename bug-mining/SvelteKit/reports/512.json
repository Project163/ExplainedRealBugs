With that set-up, the following is true:\n\n- Entering the location of the `index.html` file into a browser's URL bar loads the app\n- Entering the location of `index.html` plus `#/path/to/page` loads the correct page within the app\n- Entering the above plus a \"real\" hash -- something like `file:///path/to/index.html#/page#id-on-page` -- breaks, but only in Safari, as the second \"#\" gets encoded to `%23` and the URL becomes `file:///path/to/index.html#/page%23id-on-page`.\n\nNeither Chrome nor Edge have this issue. Internal links with `href=\"#/page#id-on-page\"` still work correctly on all browsers.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nDownload Rich's [snek](https://svelte-snek.vercel.app) demo. In Safari, attempt to open `file:///<path>/snek.html#/about#test`. This will 404 as `file:///<path>/snek.html#/about%23test`. In Chrome and Edge, this correctly just ignores the spurious hash (and would correctly jump to the element, if it existed).\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\n\n```\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\n    OS: macOS 15.2\n    CPU: (16) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\n    Memory: 401.48 MB / 16.00 GB\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 20.8.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\n    npm: 10.1.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 9.15.4 - ~/Library/pnpm/pnpm\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 131.0.6778.265\n    Edge: 131.0.2903.147\n    Safari: 18.2\n  npmPackages:\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^3.3.1 => 3.3.1 \n    @sveltejs/adapter-static: ^3.0.8 => 3.0.8 \n    @sveltejs/kit: ^2.15.3 => 2.15.3 \n    @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte: ^4.0.4 => 4.0.4 \n    svelte: ^5.18.0 => 5.18.0\n```\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13318/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13318/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
