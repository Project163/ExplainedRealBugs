My fetch do things like `fetch('https://my.site/api/get_user')` . \r\nThe URL from this `fetch` is testing on the server side is here https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/src/runtime/server/page/load_data.js#L190 and removing the hostname from the URL because the origin is the same, but the client trying to search the full path by selector because we use `fetch` URL as is here https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/src/runtime/client/client.js#L603 .\r\n\r\nIt raises the second request to API, from CSR. \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nIn the load function, you should make a `fetch` with the full path to the same hostname. \r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.4 Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)\r\n    CPU: (12) x64 AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor\r\n    Memory: 37.92 GB / 62.81 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.0.17 - /bin/bash\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.12.1 - /usr/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.19.2 - /usr/bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: 1.1.4 => 1.1.4 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.3.9 => 1.3.9 \r\n    @sveltejs/svelte-virtual-list: github:sveltejs/svelte-virtual-list => 3.0.1 \r\n    svelte: 3.55.1 => 3.55.1 \r\n    vite: ^4.0.4 => 4.0.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nserious, but I can work around it\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8852/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
