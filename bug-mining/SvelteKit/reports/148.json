It only works when explicitly telling prettier to check for svelte files with for example `src/**/*.{ts,svelte}` instead of `.`.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n- create a new sveltekit app with `pnpm create svelte@latest` and make sure to add prettier for code formatting\r\n- install the packages with `pnpm install`\r\n- run `pnpm format`\r\n\r\n> You won't see any svelte files getting formatted\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n  OS: Linux 5.10 Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS 22.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)\r\n  CPU: (24) x64 AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-Core Processor\r\n  Memory: 23.82 GB / 24.99 GB\r\n  Container: Yes\r\n  Shell: 5.8.1 - /usr/bin/zsh\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 16.17.0 - ~/.local/share/pnpm/node\r\n  npm: 8.15.0 - ~/.local/share/pnpm/npm\r\nnpmPackages:\r\n  @sveltejs/adapter-node: next => 1.0.0-next.90\r\n  @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.481\r\n  svelte: ^3.50.1 => 3.50.1\r\n  vite: ^3.1.0 => 3.1.0\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6804/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
