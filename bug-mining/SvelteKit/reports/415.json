We set things up in an automated way, so we need to know which features are available in the current installed version of `SvelteKit`.\r\ne.g. the [`entries`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options#entries) feature was recently introduced and we want to use it, but we can't really tell if it is supported becasue we don't know the installed version of `SvelteKit` on a developer's machine. If we would just add it, `SvelteKit` would throw an error.\r\n\r\nWe currently use `npm list --depth=0 @sveltejs/kit` to read the information, but it is not really reliable.\r\nTherefore it would be great if `SvelteKit` would expose the version info.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nexpose a `version` prop that can be read by any application.\r\n```js\r\nimport { version } from '@sveltejs/kit'\r\nconsole.log(version)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n\r\nProbably the easiest solution would be to create a file `/src/version.js`\r\n```js\r\nexport const version = '1.16.3'\r\n```\r\n\r\nand expose it in `/src/exports.js`\r\n```js\r\nexport { version } from '../version.js' \r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nA script in CI (`release.yml`) would override the `/src/version.js` file with the actual `version` property from `package.json`.\r\n\r\nNote: we can't just read and export the property from `package.json` because `SvelteKit` does not have a build-step and importing `json` files is curently not well supported in native `Node.js`.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNone\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\nIf this is something the `SvelteKit` team considers, I can create a PR in the coming days.","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9937/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9937/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
