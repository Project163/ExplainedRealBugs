https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/13179\r\n\r\nThis PR backports the default value for Vite 6's `ssr.resolve.conditions` options so that it doesn't fallback to `resolve.conditions` which seemingly causes it to resolve to the browser conditional export.\r\n\r\n- [Vite 5 ssr.resolve.conditions](https://v5.vite.dev/config/ssr-options.html#ssr-resolve-conditions)\r\n- [Vite 5 resolve.conditions](https://v5.vite.dev/config/shared-options.html#resolve-conditions)\r\n- [Vite 6 ssr.resolve.conditions](https://vite.dev/config/ssr-options.html#ssr-resolve-conditions)\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure if these condition values are right. @dominikg probably knows better.\r\n- Should we also include 'svelte' as a ssr resolve condition here? I noticed it's included when using vite-plugin-svelte 5 while 4 only includes it in the root resolve condition (which we are falling back to by having ssr.config.resolve as undefined?).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\nNo test because it only happens on Vite 5 and our test suite is on Vite 6.\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13181/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15706323324,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c6jhEsozwAAAAOoK3l8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/15706323324","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ebd0d32817f07f556ccd8a9c1a1b85a00f248836","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/ebd0d32817f07f556ccd8a9c1a1b85a00f248836","created_at":"2024-12-18T16:51:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-18T16:52:04Z","updated_at":"2024-12-18T16:52:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13192","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13192/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13192/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13192/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13192","id":2748311024,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c6FrOgC","number":13192,"title":"fix:

adds asynchronous SSR to an app that's using the latest version of Svelte (`^5.39.3`) and has opted in to the Svelte `experimental.async` option (and, ideally, the SvelteKit `experimental.remoteFunctions` option):\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// svelte.config.js\r\nexport default {\r\n  compilerOptions: {\r\n    experimental: {\r\n      async: true\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  kit: {\r\n    experimental: {\r\n      remoteFunctions: true\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that it's possible to use `await` anywhere in your app, without wrapping it in a boundary with a `pending` snippet. SSR will wait for all such 'naked' `await` expressions to resolve.\r\n\r\nIn turn, this means that it's practical to use remote functions, as it no longer forces you to put everything behind skeleton UI:\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<script>\r\n  import { echo } from $lib/data.remote';\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<h1>{await echo('hello world!')}</h1>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny remote function calls that occur during SSR will have their return values serialized and reused upon hydration, without an additional network round trip.\r\n\r\nThere are a few subtle bugs and caveats that make this unsuitable for production for the time being:\r\n\r\n- in some cases, an extra round trip _is_ made on hydration — specifically, if the remote function call doesn't happen immediately (because it's in an `{#if await condition}` block or something) then it doesn't pull the value from the serialized data. The data is _there_, we're just not using it in that situation. Need to figure out how to do so while guaranteeing freshness\r\n- if a query is used during SSR, and that query is not exported from a `.remote.ts` file, it will have an incorrect cache key and the serialized data will be incorrectly sent to the client (this is an easy fix, will work on it next)\r\n- hydration is slightly buggy. What we _want_ to happen is that the contents of a `<svelte:boundary>` will update together, but in the current implementation things will update as they are 'discovered'. In most cases, this does not matter, but it's observable if you have (for example) a `{Date.now()}` in multiple places\r\n- today, when you hover over a link SvelteKit will preload the dependencies for the next page on the assumption that you're about to click it; it does this by figuring out which `load` functions to call and calling them. There is, as yet, no equivalent for inline `await` expressions, because Svelte does not have an API for 'forking'\r\n\r\nAll these things will be fixed in due course.\r\n\r\nNote to reviewers: other than the obvious changes in `render.js`, the big difference in this PR is that the virtual `__sveltekit/paths` module is no more. That's because we need different implementations of `resolve(...)` and `asset(...)` between client and server. On the server, we use the event store to determine the current `event.url.pathname`, so that we can construct a relative pathname (something that previously worked by setting `base` and `assets` immediately before render, and unsetting immediately afterwards) even if they are called after an `await`. On the client, this is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThis change is long overdue. The virtual modules are a scourge, and I'd like to get rid of all of them. Having type safety and go-to-definition and everything else that goes with it is just so much nicer. All we need to do is have a few more `define` constants.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14447/reactions","total_count":83,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":37,"confused":0,"heart":20,"rocket":26,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
