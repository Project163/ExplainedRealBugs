PR seems to fix following issue with symbolic links in the routes https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/8100\r\nMinimal issue reproduction is available here: https://github.com/yukipastelcat/sveltekit-symlinks\r\nSymbolic links in the reproduction repository will be created automatically during build, but my plugin is flaky, so you might need to run `npm run build` for the second time to reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n`pnpm test` command does not exist, so I ran `pnpm test:kit` instead, some tests are failing, but they also do it in the `main` branch.\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12740/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15954700087,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5Y8ZiMzwAAAAO2-Wc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/15954700087","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"34a03ff16af29e917abebb649b31eadfc40a98a0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/34a03ff16af29e917abebb649b31eadfc40a98a0","created_at":"2025-01-16T09:48:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15955970498,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5Y8ZiMzwAAAAO3DMnC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/15955970498","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"34a03ff16af29e917abebb649b31eadfc40a98a0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cooolbros/kit/commits/34a03ff16af29e917abebb649b31eadfc40a98a0","created_at":"2025-01-16T11:22:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
