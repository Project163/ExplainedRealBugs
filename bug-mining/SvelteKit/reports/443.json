With https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/2109 adressed we can investigate whether or not it makes sense to have these additional types provided by SvelteKit itself.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nHave a file inside SvelteKit that is loaded through the generated `ambient.d.ts` file which enhances the typings like this.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndeclare module \"svelte/elements\" {\r\n  export interface HTMLAttributes {\r\n    'data-sveltekit-keepfocus'?: true | '' | 'off' | undefined | null;\r\n    // .. etc\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nkeep the tighter-than-it-needs-to-be-connection to Svelte's typings.\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI haven't quite figured out if this is a breaking change or not - i.e. is there something stopping us from just shipping this today and then removing the types in a future Svelte version, which the next major version then only supports? It's probably a breaking change because it would mean we need to remove the typings on the Svelte core side, so probably easiest to do along with Svelte 5.","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
