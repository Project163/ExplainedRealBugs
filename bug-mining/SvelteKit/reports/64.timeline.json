It looks good. \r\nbut after a page  modified,  change session  then page do the request again. \r\n\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n```\r\n<script context=\"module\">\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n    import {browser} from '$app/env';\r\n    import {session} from '$app/stores';\r\n\r\n    export let userBasicInfo={id:1};\r\n\r\n    function changeSession() {\r\n        $session.someField = Math.random();\r\n    }\r\n    $: console.log('userBasicInfo changed:', userBasicInfo);\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<pre>{JSON.stringify($session, null, 4)}</pre>\r\n\r\n<button on:click={changeSession}>\r\n    Change Ssession\r\n</button>\r\n\r\n<hr/>\r\n\r\n{#if browser}\r\n    {#await fetch(`https://reqres.in/api/users/${userBasicInfo.id}`).then(r => r.json())}\r\n        Loading...\r\n    {:then result}\r\n        <pre>{JSON.stringify(result, null, 4)}</pre>\r\n    {/await}\r\n{/if}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will  happen when a ssr page is modified  \r\nthen the manifest file at http://localhost:3000/.svelte-kit/generated/manifest.js will change.\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\nfirst time run dev:\r\nmanifest.js will be\r\n```js\r\nconst c = [\r\n\t() => import('/src/routes/__layout.svelte'),\r\n\t() => import('/.svelte-kit/runtime/components/error.svelte'),\r\n\t() => import('/src/routes/index.svelte')\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter you modify index.svelte:\r\nbefore you reload page:\r\nmanifest.js will be\r\n```js\r\nconst c = [\r\n\t() => import(\"..\\\\..\\\\src\\\\routes\\\\__layout.svelte\"),\r\n\t() => import(\"..\\\\runtime\\\\components\\\\error.svelte\"),\r\n\t() => import(\"..\\\\..\\\\src\\\\routes\\\\index.svelte\")\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter you reload page:\r\nmanifest.js will be:\r\n```js\r\nconst c = [\r\n\t() => import('/src/routes/__layout.svelte'),\r\n\t() => import('/.svelte-kit/runtime/components/error.svelte'),\r\n\t() => import('/src/routes/index.svelte?t=1644064437131')\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\nas you see  there is a version number append to the module. \r\n\r\nWhen session changed page will renderer and  modules will load :\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// preload modules\r\na.forEach((loader) => loader());\r\n``` \r\n\r\nbut modules in  page render from server have different path\r\n```js\r\nstart({\r\n\ttarget: document.querySelector('[data-hydrate=\"lf6ho7\"]').parentNode,\r\n\tpaths: {\"base\":\"\",\"assets\":\"\"},\r\n\tsession: {},\r\n\troute: true,\r\n\tspa: false,\r\n\ttrailing_slash: \"never\",\r\n\thydrate: {\r\n\t\tstatus: 200,\r\n\t\terror: null,\r\n\t\tnodes:

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nIn the docs, in the section about the `load` function, it's stated that:\r\n> ...if url, session or stuff are used in the function, they will be re-run whenever their value changes... [(here)](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#:~:text=if%20url%2C%20session%20or%20stuff%20are%20used%20in%20the%20function%2C%20they%20will%20be%20re%2Drun%20whenever%20their%20value%20changes)\r\n\r\nBut this doesn't seem to be the case. I have the following page in my SvelteKit app:\r\n`index.svelte`:\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<script lang=\"ts\" context=\"module\">\r\n    import type { Load } from '@sveltejs/kit';\r\n\r\n    export const load: Load = () => {\r\n        console.warn('index load function');\r\n        return {};\r\n    }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script lang=\"ts\">\r\n    import { session } from '$app/stores';\r\n\r\n    function changeSession() {\r\n        $session.someField = Math.random();\r\n    }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<pre>{JSON.stringify($session, null, 4)}</pre>\r\n\r\n<button on:click={changeSession}>\r\n    Change $session\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you click on the \"Change $session\" button, you'll see the message \"index load function\" appearing in the console, which obviously means the load function is re-run, even though `session` isn't used in the `load` function. This is inconsistent with the behavior described in the docs.\r\n\r\nThe strange thing, however, is that from the second time onwards, when the value of the '$session' store changes, the `load` function is no longer re-run. This is confusing.\r\n\r\n**The more severe bug**, however, which seems to be related to this one, is that every time the `$session` store changes, the page's props are apparently re-set, which means reactivity is re-triggered throughout the entire page, potentially causing massive problems.\r\n\r\nConsider the following:\r\n```svelte\r\n<script lang=\"ts\" context=\"module\">\r\n    import type { Load } from '@sveltejs/kit';\r\n\r\n    export const load: Load = () => {\r\n        console.warn('index load function');\r\n        return {\r\n            props: {\r\n                userBasicInfo: {\r\n                    id: 2,\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script lang=\"ts\">\r\n    import { browser } from '$app/env';\r\n    import { session } from '$app/stores';\r\n\r\n    export let userBasicInfo;\r\n\r\n    function changeSession() {\r\n        $session.someField = Math.random();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    $: console.log('userBasicInfo changed:', userBasicInfo);\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<pre>{JSON.stringify($session, null, 4)}</pre>\r\n\r\n<button on:click={changeSession}>\r\n    Change Ssession\r\n</button>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n{#if browser}\r\n    {#await fetch(`https://reqres.in/api/users/${userBasicInfo.id}`).then(r => r.json())}\r\n        Loading...\r\n    {:then result}\r\n        <pre>{JSON.stringify(result, null, 4)}</pre>\r\n    {/await}\r\n{/if}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this setup, whenever you click on the \"Change $session\" button — which is to say whenever you update the `$session` store — the `fetch` request in the markup, which uses the `userBaicInfo` prop, is re-triggered, even though it obviously shouldn't. And you can see the `userBasicInfo changed: ...` message in the console which proves that it's because of the `userBasicInfo` prop getting re-set.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nYou can create an empty SvelteKit skeleton project and then copy-paste the two code snippets above into the `index.svelte` file, and then `npm run dev` => open your browser and see the behavior for yourself.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.19042\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU @ 2.70GHz\r\n    Memory: 1.09 GB / 7.89 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 14.15.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE     \r\n    Yarn: 1.22.10 - ~\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\yarn.CMD       \r\n    npm: 6.14.8 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD        \r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Edge: Spartan (44.19041.1266.0), Chromium (97.0.1072.76)\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.19041.1202\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.17\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.260\r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.46.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nblocking all usage of SvelteKit","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3871/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6058148082,"node_id":"REE_lADOEiPr8c5DBo-yzwAAAAFpGADy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6058148082","actor":{"login":"babichjacob","id":22732095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzMyMDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22732095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/babichjacob","html_url":"https://github.com/babichjacob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babichjacob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babichjacob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babichjacob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babichjacob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babichjacob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babichjacob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babichjacob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babichjacob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/babichjacob/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-12T20:25:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1046679996","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3732#issuecomment-1046679996","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3732","id":1046679996,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c4-YxG8","user":{"login":"rmunn","id":90762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn","html_url":"https://github.com/rmunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-21T09:56:26Z","updated_at":"2022-02-21T09:56:26Z","body":"One thing I've found so far is that the `load()` function running twice has to do with SSR.

Describe the problem\n\nCurrently, `__error.svelte` is hardwired to `__layout.svelte`.  In several of my projects, I use `__layout.svelte` for non-trivial purposes, including authentication guards, and of course rendering part of the page.  This makes it nearly impossible to use `__error.svelte` to set up a global error page:\r\n\r\n- The error page tries to display the shared page layout, which may be undesirable, and may re-trigger the error, or [another error](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3068).\r\n- Authentication guards may attempt expensive operations, redirect to a login page, or trigger another error.\r\n\r\nI've tried to work around this by saving the error information and redirecting to a normal page to display the error, but the approach is cumbersome and fraught with problems:\r\n\r\n- There is no way to detect, in `__layout.svelte`, that the error page is running.  The URL path is the (possibly bad) path of the page that triggered the error.\r\n- There's no good way to get the error information (error, status) to the next page.  Using the session store may work, but may cause [further problems](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3732) or interfere with use of the session store for other purposes (such as server-to-client communication).\r\n- It's not clear where or how to redirect out of the error page, and this may lead to [further problems](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3051).  \r\n\r\nThis has been a nightmare.  I couldn't get it to work--I kept running into cascading issues--so I gave up (see Alternatives, below).\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nA simple solution would be to allow the error page to specify a parent layout (just like any other page, with the new named layouts):\r\n\r\n`__error@root.svelte`\r\n\r\nThis could be an empty layout, which would remove dependencies on other parts of the app, making the error page less likely to fail.  Similar to [2694](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/2694) but adapted for the new [named layouts](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/layouts#named-layouts).\r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing a catch-all path in the route root will capture any unknown page, and this can specify a named layout:\r\n\r\n`[...anypath]@root.svelte`\r\n\r\nBut this will not have access to actual error information, such as the stack trace, in development.\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThe new named layouts were a bit hard to understand at first, but they are extremely powerful, and I'm sold on this.  Fixing this would complete the picture, IMHO.

To add to the strangeness, you can even change the page props and then call a setTimeout for a large amount of time to set the $session store value and after the $session store value gets set the page props will revert to their previous value.

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5654/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7040004984,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c5DBo-yzwAAAAGjnfN4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7040004984","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-21T16:54:37Z","label":{"name":"load

Describe the problem\n\nIt's more like a genuine question about a new feature in sveltekit. I just noticed this in the docs:\r\n```\r\nThe load function is reactive, and will re-run when its parameters change, but only if they are used in the function.\r\n```\r\nAfter login when I set `$session.user = response.user;` like in the realworld demo (https://github.com/sveltejs/realworld/blob/master/src/routes/login/index.svelte) I see that the login page's `load` function runs again.\r\nI use access and refresh tokens in my app and I implemented a silent refresh method, something like the one mentioned here: https://hasura.io/blog/best-practices-of-using-jwt-with-graphql/ .\r\nWhen I do a silent refresh I reset the session, but this causes a rerun of the load function now.\r\nThe problem with this is I have a lot of components that use data returned by the load function (like an editor that gets it's content first from the load function, or a form that has it's model from the load function) and if it runs again the data changes on the page, so if I had unsaved changes in my editor for example and my silent refresh runs, it loads the data again from the server so my changes will be lost.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nIf someone could explain the benefits we get from this feature I'd be really glad, because right now this is the first thing that doesn't make any sense about sveltekit for me.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\ni cannot use SvelteKit without it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI follow the changes of sveltekit from day to day, last year I decided to ditch angular in favour of svelte and migrated almost every app to it that we had and I'm having problems with the authentication part because of this change. I'm open to alternative solutions as well.\r\n  ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/2252/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/2252/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7049081328,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5DBo-yzwAAAAGkKHHw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7049081328","actor":{"login":"seanlail","id":142589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjU4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlail","html_url":"https://github.com/seanlail","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlail/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlail/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlail/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlail/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlail/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlail/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlail/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlail/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlail/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-22T21:07:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
