You can post from a form rendered in a portal, and the invalidation appears to work correctly, without the full reload \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/arackaf/svelte-kit-form-nav-repro\r\n\r\nFirst textbox is rendered inside of SvelteKit, and works correctly. \r\n\r\nSecond one is rendered in a portal, and triggers a full page reload.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nn/a\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 13.0.1\r\n    CPU: (16) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9980HK CPU @ 2.40GHz\r\n    Memory: 208.96 MB / 16.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.11.1 - /usr/local/Cellar/nvm/0.38.0/versions/node/v16.11.1/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.17 - /usr/local/Cellar/nvm/0.38.0/versions/node/v16.11.1/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.18.0 - ~/Documents/node_modules/.bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 108.0.5359.94\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.90\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.571\r\n    svelte: ^3.53.1 => 3.53.1\r\n    vite: ^3.2.4 => 3.2.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nserious, but I can work around it\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7940/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
