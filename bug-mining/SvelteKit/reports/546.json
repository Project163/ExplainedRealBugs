The problem is that when I catch the error in enhance, it has a status of 500 instead of 400. However, when I check Chrome DevTools, I can see that the remote function responds with a 400 status. Is this a bug, or is there another way to access the response status?\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI have the following remote function:\n\n```ts\nexport const update = form(async (data) => {\n  error(400, 'Some error')\n}\n```\n\nIn my form I try to get the status code from the error:\n```ts\n<form {...update.enhance(async ({ submit }) => {\n    try {\n      await submit()\n    } catch(err) {\n      console.log(err.status) // This logs 500\n    }\n  })}\n>\n  <button type=\"submit\">Update</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\n\n```\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\n    OS: macOS 15.6\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Pro\n    Memory: 794.78 MB / 32.00 GB\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 24.3.0 - /opt/homebrew/bin/node\n    npm: 11.4.2 - /opt/homebrew/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 10.12.4 - /opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm\n    bun: 1.2.17 - /opt/homebrew/bin/bun\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 139.0.7258.128\n    Safari: 18.6\n  npmPackages:\n    @auth/sveltekit: ^1.10.0 => 1.10.0 \n    @eslint/compat: ^1.3.2 => 1.3.2 \n    @eslint/js: ^9.33.0 => 9.33.0 \n    @inlang/paraglide-js: ^2.2.0 => 2.2.0 \n    @playwright/test: ^1.54.2 => 1.54.2 \n    @sentry/sveltekit: 10.5.0 => 10.5.0 \n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: ^5.3.1 => 5.3.1 \n    @sveltejs/kit: ^2.31.1 => 2.31.1 \n    @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte: ^6.1.2 => 6.1.2 \n    @tailwindcss/vite: ^4.1.12 => 4.1.12 \n    @types/papaparse: ^5.3.16 => 5.3.16 \n    esbuild: ^0.25.9 => 0.25.9 \n    eslint: ^9.33.0 => 9.33.0 \n    eslint-config-prettier: ^10.1.8 => 10.1.8 \n    eslint-plugin-svelte: ^3.11.0 => 3.11.0 \n    exceljs: ^4.4.0 => 4.4.0 \n    globals: ^16.3.0 => 16.3.0 \n    googleapis: ^156.0.0 => 156.0.0 \n    msw: ^2.10.5 => 2.10.5 \n    noph-ui: ^0.22.5 => 0.22.5 \n    papaparse: ^5.5.3 => 5.5.3 \n    prettier: ^3.6.2 => 3.6.2 \n    prettier-plugin-svelte: ^3.4.0 => 3.4.0 \n    prettier-plugin-tailwindcss: ^0.6.14 => 0.6.14 \n    svelte: ^5.38.2 => 5.38.2 \n    svelte-check: ^4.3.1 => 4.3.1 \n    tailwindcss: ^4.1.12 => 4.1.12 \n    typescript: ^5.9.2 => 5.9.2 \n    typescript-eslint: ^8.39.1 => 8.39.1 \n    vite: ^7.1.2 => 7.1.2 \n    vitest: ^3.2.4 => 3.2.4 \n    zod: ^4.0.17 => 4.0.17\n```\n\n### Severity\n\nblocking an upgrade\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
