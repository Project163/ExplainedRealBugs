Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18735457080,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c7BbAB7zwAAAARcuGM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/18735457080","actor":{"login":"j-tai","id":45131430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTMxNDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45131430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-tai","html_url":"https://github.com/j-tai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-tai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-tai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-tai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-tai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-tai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-tai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-tai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-tai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-tai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-21T19:22:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18736720634,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c7BbAB7zwAAAARcy6r6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/18736720634","actor":{"login":"aurelienrichard","id":56389380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Mzg5Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56389380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurelienrichard","html_url":"https://github.com/aurelienrichard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurelienrichard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurelienrichard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurelienrichard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurelienrichard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurelienrichard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurelienrichard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurelienrichard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurelienrichard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aurelienrichard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-21T20:45:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18745440493,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c7BbAB7zwAAAARdULjt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/18745440493","actor":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-22T07:44:27Z","label":{"name":"pkg:adapter-cloudflare","color":"c5def5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18745442677,"node_id":"ITAE_lADOEiPr8c7BbAB7zwAAAARdUMF1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/18745442677","actor":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teeming

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
