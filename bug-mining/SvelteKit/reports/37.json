In javascript you can use the [generated types](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/types#generated), but that's not possible with typescript. So the whole object or individual keys should be able to type. Example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport async function get({ params }: ThereIsNoTypeAvailable): Promise<RequestHandlerOutput> {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport async function get({ params }: { params: ThereIsNoTypeAvailable }): Promise<RequestHandlerOutput> {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output is fine, `RequestHandlerOutput` is available and we can use it.\r\n\r\nYeah, you can type a function expression like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const get: RequestHandler = async ({ params }) => {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it's impossible to type function statements right now. There's `RequestEvent` but it's not exported (it's private).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the `load` function is fine:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  export async function load({ params, fetch }: LoadInput): Promise<LoadOutput> {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use the `Load` type on a function expression or `LoadInput` + `LoadOutput` on a function statement.\r\n\r\nSo we should have consistency and have both input and output types available in functions, specially `get`.\r\n\r\n| load()  | get()|\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Load | RequestHandler |\r\n| LoadInput | ???????? |\r\n| LoadOutput | RequestHandlerOutput |\r\n\r\nMaybe `RequestHandlerInput` ?\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nNA\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nserious, but I can work around it\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nNA","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4965/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
