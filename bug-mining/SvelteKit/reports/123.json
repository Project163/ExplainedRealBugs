Very weird. I'm pretty confident this is a bug.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n- Clone https://github.com/aradalvand/sveltekit-invalidate-with-params\r\n- Run and open the app (the home page) in the browser\r\n- Open the console, run `invalidate('user')`. You'll see that the layout's load function gets re-run, as expected:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26527405/187087544-eee0938b-19a2-4e18-81aa-5beb0b12a9fb.png)\r\n- Now, click on the link in the home page titled \"Go to foo\"\r\n- After navigating to the `/foo/123` page, open the console and run the same command again. This time, it won't work, the layout's load function isn't re-run:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26527405/187087581-0f36b16e-2f3a-45b9-b4dc-01bcde127e62.png)\r\n \r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.15 Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa)\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU @ 2.70GHz\r\n    Memory: 486.11 MB / 3.77 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.8 - /usr/bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.15.1 - /usr/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.11.0 - /usr/bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.65\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.445\r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.49.0\r\n    vite: ^3.0.4 => 3.0.9\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nblocking all usage of SvelteKit\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThe problem only exists for pages that have parameters, I have no idea why, but I think this information could be useful for diagnosing the problem.","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6354/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
