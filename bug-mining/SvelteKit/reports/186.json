Finally got it all working in `pnpm dev`, so I go to build and... fail. I have been racking my brain but unfortunately I haven't been able to pin down exactly why. It seems that it is something with the adapter itself, but obviously not all adapter-vercel builds are failing, so maybe it is something on my end. Ahh! 😕 Maybe this has been seen before and there is a known solution? 🤞🏻  \r\n\r\nThe vite part of the build works fine, so `pnpm preview` works, just not the final build. I have also tried building with adapter-node which worked as expected and even adapter-netlify which worked, although I did not deploy it.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSorry, no repro. I have not been able to pin down exactly what is causing this. Feel free to close I guess but just frustrating since I deploy to vercel. I would just say it is obviously something on my end, but it is weird that adapter-node and adapter-netlify build successfully if that is the case.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nerror during build:\r\nTypeError: object null is not iterable (cannot read property Symbol(Symbol.iterator))\r\n    at file:///Users/caleb/repos/[redacted]/node_modules/.pnpm/@sveltejs+adapter-vercel@1.0.0-next.78/node_modules/@sveltejs/adapter-vercel/index.js:318:33\r\n    at Set.forEach (<anonymous>)\r\n    at create_function_bundle (file:///Users/caleb/repos/[redacted]/node_modules/.pnpm/@sveltejs+adapter-vercel@1.0.0-next.78/node_modules/@sveltejs/adapter-vercel/index.js:307:18)\r\n    at async generate_serverless_function (file:///Users/caleb/repos/[redacted]/node_modules/.pnpm/@sveltejs+adapter-vercel@1.0.0-next.78/node_modules/@sveltejs/adapter-vercel/index.js:153:5)\r\n    at async adapt (file:///Users/caleb/repos/[redacted]/node_modules/.pnpm/@sveltejs+adapter-vercel@1.0.0-next.78/node_modules/@sveltejs/adapter-vercel/index.js:235:5)\r\n    at async adapt (file:///Users/caleb/repos/[redacted]/node_modules/.pnpm/@sveltejs+kit@1.0.0-next.514_svelte@3.51.0+vite@3.1.7/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/core/adapt/index.js:28:2)\r\n    at async Object.handler (file:///Users/caleb/repos/[redacted]/node_modules/.pnpm/@sveltejs+kit@1.0.0-next.514_svelte@3.51.0+vite@3.1.7/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/exports/vite/index.js:488:6)\r\n    at async PluginDriver.hookParallel (file:///Users/caleb/repos/[redacted]/node_modules/.pnpm/rollup@2.78.1/node_modules/rollup/dist/es/shared/rollup.js:22632:17)\r\n    at async Object.close (file:///Users/caleb/repos/[redacted]/node_modules/.pnpm/rollup@2.78.1/node_modules/rollup/dist/es/shared/rollup.js:23709:13)\r\n    at async Promise.all (index 0)\r\nERROR Command failed with exit code 1.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.6\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max\r\n    Memory: 1.45 GB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.17.0 - ~/.nodenv/versions/16.17.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.15 - ~/.nodenv/shims/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.15.0 - ~/.nodenv/versions/16.17.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 106.0.5249.119\r\n    Firefox: 105.0.3\r\n    Safari: 16.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-netlify: ^1.0.0-next.80 => 1.0.0-next.80 \r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: ^1.0.0-next.97 => 1.0.0-next.97 \r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-vercel: ^1.0.0-next.78 => 1.0.0-next.78 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.0.0-next.514 => 1.0.0-next.514 \r\n    svelte: ^3.51.0 => 3.51.0 \r\n    vite: ^3.1.7 => 3.1.7\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nblocking all usage of SvelteKit\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7245/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
