issue: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/8398\r\n\r\nThis solves layouts *always* invalidating and rerunning `load` if they mention `event.route`, even if the route ID did not change, due to a wrong comparison in the code.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how to write tests, but this should be simple enough.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8399/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8177253770,"node_id":"RTE_lADOEiPr8c5a4L6HzwAAAAHnZv2K","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8177253770","actor":{"login":"Algoinde","id":10269970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjY5OTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10269970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algoinde","html_url":"https://github.com/Algoinde","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algoinde/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algoinde/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algoinde/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algoinde/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algoinde/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algoinde/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algoinde/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algoinde/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Algoinde/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-08T22:29:28Z","rename":{"from":"Route
