Running\r\n\r\nfetch(\"/api/my-endpoint\")\r\n\r\nwith the global fetch that's in scope will puke, since \"/api/my-endpoint\" has no way of resolving. Obviously you have to destructure the fetch that's passed to your loader. Simple enough, but it's an easy thing to miss when you're new (at SvelteKit), and it's *maddening* to debug.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nWould it be possible for the global fetch to detect when an (otherwise valid) api endpoint is being requested, and error with something clear about needing to use the provided fetch to hit endpoints?\r\n\r\nI know this woulnd't be foolproof, since shared loaders are (I assume?) using the browser's provided fetch, which would be hard for you all to wrap, but on the server you're already providing your own fetch, so could this check be added to that (presumably for non-production builds)? \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nn/a\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7976/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
