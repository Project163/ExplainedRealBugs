Upon running the provided \"hello world\" application with the counter, I am greeted with the spurious warnings on the console as described in the OP, which lead me to wading through this thread & https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/4652 to try and get a handle on the situation.\r\n\r\nThis is not a great DX experience for new users. In the first minutes of using SvelteKit, I want to be building my app, not spending 15 minutes troubleshooting warnings. I'm posting here not to complain about the product, but rather to emphasize the importance of fixing this issue if SvelteKit is to retain new users.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1219184960/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Zamiell","id":5511220,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTEyMjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5511220?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell","html_url":"https://github.com/Zamiell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zamiell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1219505393","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5980#issuecomment-1219505393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5980","id":1219505393,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5IsCzx","user":{"login":"aradalvand","id":26527405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTI3NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26527405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand","html_url":"https://github.com/aradalvand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-18T13:39:03Z","updated_at":"2022-08-18T13:43:00Z","body":"> Agree, the warning should only appear if we're passing data or errors and they're not being received\r\n\r\n@Rich-Harris Perhaps not even in those cases, sometimes you're just returning data for the layout(s) to consume, you don't necessarily need it in the `+page.svelte` itself.
