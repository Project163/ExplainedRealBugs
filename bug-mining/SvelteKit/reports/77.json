I'm NOT explicitly listing the pre-rendered pages in the svelte config, I'm letting the crawler discover them automatically. After migrating to `1.0.0-next.408` with the new routing, the pre-render crawler seems to be skipping pages if both of the following are true:\r\n\r\n1. the page is behind a redirect\r\n2. the page URL has a [param]\r\n\r\nIt was working before the routing overhaul. See the stackblitz link below for a repro. The `/foo` route redirects to `/foo/bar` which is handled by `/foo/[slug]/+page.svelte`. The `/foo2` route redirects to `/foo2/bar2` which DOES NOT have a param, it just resolves to `/foo2/bar2/+page.svelte`. Both page options are `prerender = true`, and both are linked from the home. The first is NOT prerendering but the second is. In the repro, run `npm run build` to see that 1 is getting prerendered which the other is not.\r\n\r\n## Before routing overhaul\r\n\r\nThis was working before the routing overhaul. Previously, I was doing my redirect within a standalone endpoint with something like\r\n```\r\nexport async function GET() {\r\n  return {\r\n    headers: {\r\n      location: `/newpath`\r\n    },\r\n    status: 302\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also notice that the logs when I used to `npm run build` used to acknowledge my redirect:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n10:05:52 AM: .svelte-kit/output/server/immutable/chunks/Container-0a471dd0.js             0.53 KiB\r\n10:05:52 AM: .svelte-kit/output/server/immutable/chunks/EnrichedMarkdown-324634e1.js      11.89 KiB\r\n10:05:52 AM: .svelte-kit/output/server/immutable/chunks/SchemaLabel-59931fc3.js           7.15 KiB\r\n10:05:52 AM: .svelte-kit/output/server/immutable/chunks/hooks-3a5209ad.js                 1.72 KiB\r\n10:05:52 AM: (node:1377) ExperimentalWarning: buffer.Blob is an experimental feature.
