Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11029/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11029/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10953981461,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c52mKDxzwAAAAKM6H4V","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/10953981461","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-14T12:24:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10953981720,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c52mKDxzwAAAAKM6H8Y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/10953981720","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"127bdea56fd87e3a5ec6ee09b93e702e9a203791","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/127bdea56fd87e3a5ec6ee09b93e702e9a203791","created_at":"2023-11-14T12:24:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"hyunbinseo","id":47051820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDUxODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47051820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunbinseo","html_url":"https://github.com/hyunbinseo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunbinseo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunbinseo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunbinseo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunbinseo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunbinseo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunbinseo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunbinseo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunbinseo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyunbinseo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-21T01:15:52Z","updated_at":"2023-11-21T01:15:52Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11086","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11086/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11086/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11086/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/11086","id":2001285843,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c53STLT","number":11086,"title":"create-svelte
