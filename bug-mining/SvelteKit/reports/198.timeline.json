Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI've migrated to SvelteKit 1.0.0-next.475 and its new cookies API, and logging into my website no longer works, cookies are no longer set at all.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kevinrenskers/sk-cookie-bug\r\n\r\nOn the homepage I show the token which is stored in a cookie, which of course defaults to `undefined`. There is a link to a login page, which has a login button. This does a request to a local endpoint, which sets a cookie. It then redirects you back to the homepage, and that token should now be updated.\r\n\r\nIn reality the token is still undefined, and looking at the cookies in the storage inspector, there is nothing there.\r\n\r\nThis used to work with the previous set-header method just fine.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.5.1\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max\r\n    Memory: 574.67 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 3.5.1 - /opt/homebrew/bin/fish\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.17.0 - ~/Library/pnpm/node\r\n    npm: 8.15.0 - ~/Library/pnpm/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Safari: 15.6.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.71\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.475\r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.50.0\r\n    vite: ^3.1.0 => 3.1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nblocking an upgrade\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6632/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1239426923","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6609#issuecomment-1239426923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6609","id":1239426923,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5J4Cdr","user":{"login":"cdcarson","id":78032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdcarson","html_url":"https://github.com/cdcarson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdcarson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdcarson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdcarson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdcarson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdcarson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdcarson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdcarson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdcarson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdcarson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-07T13:56:39Z","updated_at":"2022-09-07T13:56:39Z","body":"> I have tested the new update with the same reproduction and the issue still persists.\r\n\r\n@s3812497 Yep. #6622 fixed something relatively obvious, but there's something else going on here.

are some issues with cookie deletion unresolved in this issue: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6609\r\n\r\nI believe the issue was that we were not setting the path on delete (and maybe on set.) Some tests are needed to confirm. \r\n\r\n~~Marking this as draft until then.~~\r\n\r\n- [x] unit tests \r\n- [x] e2e tests (probably good to have more eventually, fix and unskip the flaky one)\r\n- [x] expose `cookie` serialize options from the SvelteKit cookies API ~~(this should be a separate typescript issue)~~ this is fixed by directly annotating the `get`, `set` and `delete` with JSDoc params rather than relying on the imported type of `cookies`\r\n- [x] document api changes, if any (e.g. setting `path` to other than '/') See [this comment](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/6648#issuecomment-1241215406) for suggested copy.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6648/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6648/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1247372762","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6609#issuecomment-1247372762","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6609","id":1247372762,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5KWWXa","user":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-14T22:39:58Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T22:57:03Z","body":"Hi
