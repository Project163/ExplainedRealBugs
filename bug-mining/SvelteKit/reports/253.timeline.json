Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7881/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":3,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7881/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-30T15:56:51Z","updated_at":"2022-11-30T15:56:51Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7890","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7890/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7890/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7890/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7890","id":1469844778,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c5XnA0q","number":7890,"title":"`find_anchor`

Describe the bug\n\nUsing `on:click` to remove an element or a (grand- etc)parent of that element results in `find_anchor` (defined in `packages/kit/src/runtime/client/utils.js`) being called with the element that is now not element of the DOM anymore, which in turn results in `element` becoming `null` while iterating up the hierarchy, which `find_anchor` does not handle.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n```svelte\r\n<script>\r\n    let list = [\"X\"];\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n{#each list as elem}\r\n    <button on:click={() => { list = []; }}>{elem}</button>\r\n{/each}\r\n```\r\nor as a repository (based on `npm create svelte@latest`, I hope that is minimal enough?): https://github.com/42triangles/repro-remove-elem-error\r\n\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\nInstallTrigger is deprecated and

Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 6.0 Arch Linux\r\n    CPU: (12) x64 AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor\r\n    Memory: 21.65 GB / 31.28 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.9 -

Additional Information\n\nIt looks like this doesn't result in any actual visible bugs beyond the error being shown in the console, though if `find_anchor` being called in this context is correct, the fix would be very simple too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7890/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7923478954,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c5XftC-zwAAAAHYRrGq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7923478954","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-30T15:57:06Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7923507187,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5XftC-zwAAAAHYRx_z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7923507187","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-30T16:00:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7923507511,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5XftC-zwAAAAHYRyE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7923507511","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e2c74b7278ed75de681dfbbe84969c6cc318660c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/e2c74b7278ed75de681dfbbe84969c6cc318660c","created_at":"2022-11-30T16:00:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"mc-0bit","id":77062151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MDYyMTUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77062151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc-0bit","html_url":"https://github.com/mc-0bit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc-0bit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc-0bit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc-0bit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc-0bit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc-0bit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc-0bit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mc-0bit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/u
