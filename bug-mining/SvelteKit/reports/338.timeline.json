#8872 \r\ncloses #8898 \r\n\r\n- removed project_relative cause the paths are already resolved to be absolute when the config is processed \r\n- also fixes the other problem mentioned in https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/8872#issuecomment-1415453987, which was caused by project_relative returning an empty string for any folder directly inside the project directory, so config_relative was pointing to `/**/*.js`\r\n- had to add a special case for src because otherwise it'd be a breaking change\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [ ] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8880/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8880/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8459967157,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5diwY6zwAAAAH4QNq1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8459967157","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-07T16:31:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8459967333,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5diwY6zwAAAAH4QNtl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8459967333","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b915dfe9d16a930246a469c9aea8c1a84e5157ba","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/b915dfe9d16a930246a469c9aea8c1a84e5157ba","created_at":"2023-02-07T16:31:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
