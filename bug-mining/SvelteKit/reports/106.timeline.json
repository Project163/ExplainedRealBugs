url.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1225833655/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bjon","id":280413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDQxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon","html_url":"https://github.com/bjon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7251722625,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c5QXCiVzwAAAAGwPIGB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7251722625","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-24T14:50:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7251722638,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5QXCiVzwAAAAGwPIGO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7251722638","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-24T14:50:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"CaptainCodeman","id":304910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDkxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/304910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaptainCodeman","html_url":"https://github.com/CaptainCodeman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaptainCodeman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaptainCodeman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaptainCodeman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaptainCodeman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaptainCodeman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaptainCodeman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaptainCodeman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaptainCodeman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaptainCodeman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-25T18:42:49Z","updated_at":"2022-08-25T18:42:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6286","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6286/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sve

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts.

Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI find it weird that the `url` object inside `handle` in `hooks.server.ts` differs from the `url` object passed to the route files.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the `/__data.json` information from the route is just for the `resolve` function to distinguish what it should return.\r\n\r\nUse-cases I see problematic with the current approach:\r\n - redirecting in case of an unauthenticated request and saving the current information as a \"redirectTo\" parameter\r\n   This works fine as long as you directly access `/dashboard/project1` in the browser, but if you would get redirected via a client-side navigation, the \"redirectTo\" parameter will be `/dashboard/project1/__data.json`\r\n - logging: when I want to track how many requests were made to `/dashboard/project1` I would also need to look for `/dashboard/project1/__data.json` entries (assuming I log all accesses with its url from within `hooks.server.ts`)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to make a workaround for those usecases and manually remove the `/data.json` at the end of the url, but you first have to discover that this \"issue\" exists. I see this as a hurdle for new or inexperienced users.\r\n\r\nAnd I also see it problematic if e.g. for some reasons `__data.json` gets renamed to `__data.json5` or `__data.xml`  in the future to support other content formats. Then the workarounds will no longer work.\r\n\r\n> Here is a small project demonstrating a problematic logging issue: https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-sllc4q?file=src/hooks.server.ts\r\n> 1. Click on the \"page 1\" link\r\n> 2. Reload the page\r\n> 3. See that both requests resulted in different log outputs\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nUse the same `url` object within `hooks.server.ts` (without `/data.json` at the end) and add a new attribute to the `event` object to distinguish between regular requests and data requests.\r\n\r\nThis would mean a breaking change, but the migration process should be fairly simple.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nLeave it as it is\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7926/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
