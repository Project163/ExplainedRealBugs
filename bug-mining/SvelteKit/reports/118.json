Not sure if it was intended or not, but it would be nice if we could use `transformPage` in all handles, regardless of order.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-wg5zme?file=src%2Fhooks.js&terminal=dev\r\n\r\nYou can see in the reproduction that the html `lang` attribute is not changed. If we swap the two handle functions so that the one that uses `transformPage` comes last, the html is changed.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.22000\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz\r\n    Memory: 19.88 GB / 39.76 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.13.1 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    npm: 8.4.1 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Edge: Spartan (44.22000.120.0), Chromium (98.0.1108.43)\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.22000.120\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-vercel: 1.0.0-next.43 => 1.0.0-next.43\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.0.0-next.278 => 1.0.0-next.278\r\n    svelte: ^3.46.4 => 3.46.4\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4051/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4051/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
