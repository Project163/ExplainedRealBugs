In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts.

Describe the problem\n\nWhen doing a client-side `__data.json` request, errors thrown with the `error` helper function inside `hooks.server.ts` , will not return the correct error object.\r\n\r\nIt works as expected when `error` gets thrown inside a `+server.*` file.\r\n\r\nHere is a demonstration of the issue; https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-djcepj?file=src/hooks.server.ts\r\n\r\n1. start the application\r\n2. click on the \"test hooks.server.ts\" link\r\n3. a 401 error gets thrown inside `hooks.servert.ts`\r\n4. the page shows a 500 error\r\n5. reload the page\r\n6. the 401 error gets correctly shown\r\n\r\nrelated: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7609\r\nThe issue was already described as a sidenote there.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\n`SvelteKit` should support throwing `error` objects also for `__data.json` requests inside `hooks.server.ts`.\r\nThis makes the usage of the `error` helper function more consistent.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nLeave it as it is\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No
