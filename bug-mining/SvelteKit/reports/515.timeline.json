Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13334/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/2597691245","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/13331#issuecomment-2597691245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13331","id":2597691245,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c6a1Z9t","user":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-17T08:30:00Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T08:30:00Z","body":"I've

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nRunning Vite-related tools (e.g. Vitest) in a monorepo may mess up SvelteKit's generated`.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json`.\r\n\r\nLooks like the Vite plugin currently uses `process.cwd()` in async functions. However, due to a race condition, it's not guaranteed that `process.cwd()` still points to SvelteKit's package dir by the time the `configureServer` Vite plugin hook is invoked.\r\n\r\nMore context from a previous discovery is available in [this issue](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vscode/issues/359#issuecomment-2066243509).\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltekit-vitest-tsconfig-hijack?file=README.md\r\n\r\nRunning e.g. `vitest` or `vite build` from within `packages/my-app` will generate `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, running `vitest` from the root monorepo dir can cause `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` to be generated with unexpected relative paths pointing to other packages. If SvelteKit `dev` is running at the same time, that'll also bust the dev preview.\r\n\r\nNotable repro logs:\r\n\r\nWhen running e.g. `vitest`, you'll see the Vite plugin log different values for `process.cmd()` vs `config.root`:\r\n```\r\n[cwd-vs-config-root] process.cwd: /home/projects/sveltekit-vitest-tsconfig-hijack/packages/z-another-app\r\n[cwd-vs-config-root] config.root: /home/projects/sveltekit-vitest-tsconfig-hijack/packages/my-app\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfterwards, `.sveltekit/tsconfig.json` is still expected to contain:\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"$myAlias\": [\"../src/myAlias\"],\r\n      \"$myAlias/*\": [\"../src/myAlias/*\"],\r\n      // ...\r\n    },\r\n    \"rootDirs\": [\"..\", \"./types\"],\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, the actual contents are:\r\n```jsonc\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"$myAlias\": [\"../../z-another-app/src/myAlias\"],\r\n      \"$myAlias/*\": [\"../../z-another-app/src/myAlias/*\"],\r\n      // ...\r\n    },\r\n    \"rootDirs\": [\"../../z-another-app\", \"./types\"],\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(This is just a stub; other paths in `\"include\"` and `\"exclude\"` are also affected.)\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n_(should be irrelevant - below from the Stackblitz repro)_\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.0 undefined\r\n    CPU: (6) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 0 Bytes / 0 Bytes\r\n    Shell: 1.0 - /bin/jsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.18.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 10.2.3 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n    pnpm: 8.15.3 - /usr/local/bin/pnpm\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nserious, but I can work around it\r\n\r\nCurrent workarounds:\r\n- Never run Vitest at the same time as SvelteKit's `dev` (also disable the Vitest VSCode extension!)\r\n   or\r\n- Omit the global `vitest.workspace.js` file for now\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nA Vitest contributor suggested to use `vite_config.root` instead of `process.cmd()`\r\n- [Comment](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vscode/issues/359#issuecomment-2065508835)\r\n- [Source Code](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/e7489aa558244ff0a356b07c62199f25e7afb025/packages/kit/src/core/sync/write_tsconfig.js#L36-L47)\r\n\r\nThe Vite config root is available e.g. via `server.config.root` in the `configureServer` Vite plugin hook, which could then be passed down as an argument (or some kind of context object).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12140/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
