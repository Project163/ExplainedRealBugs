Describe the problem\n\nCaching is great, it makes things fast. But using a cached page after an app deploy means all the script references are wrong and \"bad things\". So some form of \"app version\" needs to be part of any cache key.\r\n\r\nThere is a generated version string, used for the update checks. That could be read from `build/client/_app/version.json`except ... it won't be there during the build if pre-rendering.\r\n\r\nSo you have to check if running in `dev` or `prerendering` mode before reading the file.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nI would like to be able to access the version string from `$app/environment`\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nMaybe it's already exposed from '$service-worker'?\r\n\r\nBut I don't know if that only works if using a service-worker, and it feels odd importing it from there when it isn't _really_ anything todo with a service-worker.\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7694/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7831654635,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5TOjQ3zwAAAAHSzZDr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7831654635","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-17T08:59:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7831654869,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5TOjQ3zwAAAAHSzZHV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7831654869","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d3a5db37cb9cc00cd0e39935c164801343112e81","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/d3a5db37cb9cc00cd0e39935c164801343112e81","created_at":"2022-11-17T08:59:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
