Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n\r\n### Fixes #7496  \r\n\r\nThis PR splits the `get_aliases` function into two. One that returns aliases that are consumer-configurable, another that returns the 'stock' aliases (`__GENERATED__` and `$app`).\r\n\r\nWith this refactor, this PR also involves the config aliases in service worker builds, meaning service workers can import modules using custom aliases defined in
