In fact, I believe such sentence was there in the previous docs. And it would make a connection with the SPA definition which almost stands alone in the Annex (except for one mention in Adapter Static - but that is not enough to make it a SPA). \r\n\r\nThe previous doc mentioned, if you add `some code related to ssr` to hook.ts and use adapter static, you make it a SPA - I believe.\r\n\r\nI know SPA is not the preferred way to go in kit, but for some cases usefull (like wrapped in Cordova/Capacitor/Electron) or inevitable (when using SSR-incompatible libraries). \r\n\r\nHappy to do a PR on the doc with the sentence on at least two places - Page Options & Page Options|Static Sites.
