For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6678/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7355691788,"node_id":"RTE_lADOEiPr8c5RhVhgzwAAAAG2bvMM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7355691788","actor":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-09T11:42:44Z","rename":{"from":"Form `enhance` does not work when action is a different route","to":"Form `enhance` does not work when `action` points to a different route"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1241907206","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6695#issuecomment-1241907206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6695","id":1241907206,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5KBgAG","user":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-09T12:17:52Z","updated_at":"2022-09-09T12:17:52Z","body":"It's there by design.

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6776/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6776/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7382960282,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5RhVhgzwAAAAG4Dwia","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7382960282","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"d2db7edff6a969ea79c1a1ba6576b489d38ed92d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/d2db7edff6a969ea79c1a1ba6576b489d38ed92d","created_at":"2022-09-14T07:28:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1247311736","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6695#issuecomment-1247311736","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6695","id":1247311736,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5KWHd4","user":{"login":"danawoodman","id":157695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danawoodman","html_url":"https://github.com/danawoodman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danawoodman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danawoodman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danawoodman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danawoodman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danawoodman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danawoodman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danawoodman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danawoodman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danawoodman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-14T21:17:07Z","updated_at":"2022-09-14T21:41:15Z","body":"Does `use:enhance` not work at all if action is different than the current path? \r\n\r\nI'm trying to do a simple action that throws a `redirect` but it doesn't do anything. \r\n\r\nIs that expected or is it a bug?
