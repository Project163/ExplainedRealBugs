At runtime, it doesn't update the html file with the new values of process.env.\r\n\r\nThis works if `export const prerender = false` is set.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-9cnqal?file=src/lib/Vars.svelte\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.0 undefined\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 0 Bytes / 0 Bytes\r\n    Shell: 1.0 - /bin/jsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.2 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 7.17.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: ^1.2.0 => 1.2.0 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.5.0 => 1.9.2 \r\n    svelte: ^3.54.0 => 3.55.1 \r\n    vite: ^4.0.0 => 4.1.4\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9275/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9275/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
