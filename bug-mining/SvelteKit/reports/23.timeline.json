Describe the problem\r\n\r\nCould have sworn we already had an issue for this. Anyway. Custom aliases are a tiny bit confusing at the moment, because you have to declare them in both the Vite config and the TypeScript config, using very different approaches:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst config = {\r\n  kit: {\r\n    vite: {\r\n      resolve: {\r\n        alias: {\r\n          $utils: path.resolve('src/utils')\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"$utils\": [\"src/utils\"],\r\n      \"$utils/*\": [\"src/utils/*\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd because of the tsconfig merging logic, as soon as you declare custom aliases you have to take care to _also_ declare the `$lib` alias...\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n+      \"$lib\": [\"src/lib\"],\r\n+      \"$lib/*\": [\"src/lib/*\"],\r\n      \"$utils\": [\"src/utils\"],\r\n      \"$utils/*\": [\"src/utils/*\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...even if you're not using it, which [annoys some people](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4218).\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst config = {\r\n  kit: {\r\n    alias: {\r\n      $utils: 'src/utils'\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor Vite, we add `[key]: path.resolve(project_root, value)`.\r\n\r\nFor TypeScript, we add `[key]: value, [key + '/*']: value + '/*'`.\r\n\r\nPeople still have the ability to use the more complex options if they so choose, but this takes care of common cases.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nNot doing this, on the grounds that overusing aliases is problematic.\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nnice to have\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4734/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4734/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6506128924,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5FIuCUzwAAAAGDy6Yc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6506128924","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-27T11:17:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6506129044,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5FIuCUzwAAAAGDy6aU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6506129044","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"791c90c6697164384ea64e4b00229fa54c979ac1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/791c90c6697164384ea64e4b00229fa54c979ac1","created_at":"2022-04-27T11:17:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
