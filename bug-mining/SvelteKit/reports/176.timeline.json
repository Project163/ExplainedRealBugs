Describe the problem\n\nIn response to #7163, commit f8a8428e35459e38bf93d5cd3d8b7a0e02a89c8c was made, which automatically resets a progressively-enhanced form if the result type was `success`. Love it.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a redirect back to the same page, though, the form does not get reset. \r\n\r\nI have to add code to manually check for a `redirect` result if I want this behavior:\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n  <form\r\n    action=\"?/askQuestion\"\r\n    method=\"post\"\r\n    use:enhance={({ formElement }) => {\r\n      return ({ result, update }) => {\r\n        if (['success', 'redirect'].includes(result.type)) {\r\n          formElement.reset();\r\n        }\r\n        update();\r\n      };\r\n    }}\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nI'd like to request that the form also reset when the result type is `redirect`. (When either `use:enhance` was called with no arguments or when `update` was called.)\r\n\r\nThe reason: [Redirect after post](https://www.theserverside.com/news/1365146/Redirect-After-Post) is a common pattern, and after a successful form post I like to `redirect(303, url.pathname)` in order to remove the `?/actionName` queryparam from the URL.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering it.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11694/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11694/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
