Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWhen we call `fetch` to an internal endpoint the request is not initialized the same way it would be in the browser or using `undici`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/0d4596340389233031588a77e478f9fb34a26d4e/packages/kit/src/runtime/server/fetch.js#L131\r\n\r\nHere's the spec: https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetching\r\n\r\nIn particular, I noticed that we're not setting the `Accept` header, but it looks like there's other stuff we're not doing either like setting `Accept-Language`.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nCall a `+server.js` from a `load` function in a `+page.js`\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/sveltejs/sites/pull/398\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No
