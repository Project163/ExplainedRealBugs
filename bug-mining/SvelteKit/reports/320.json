Click on \"Page 1\" link in nav. The input on the destination page is automatically focused since it has `autofocus`.\r\n2. Click back to \"Home\". You'll see that the autofocus input is still the active element, even though it is not currently on the page. Depending on the browser and what is on the new page, your focus may start midway down the page when tabbing instead of starting at the top.\r\n\r\nIf you click between \"Home\" and \"Page 2\" instead (which does not have an `autofocus` attribute), focus is reset to the body as expected.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.0 undefined\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 0 Bytes / 0 Bytes\r\n    Shell: 1.0 - /bin/jsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.2 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 7.17.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^1.0.0 => 1.0.0 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.0.0 => 1.0.10 \r\n    svelte: ^3.54.0 => 3.55.0 \r\n    vite: ^4.0.0 => 4.0.4\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8438/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
