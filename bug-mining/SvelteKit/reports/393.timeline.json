It activates whenever we click on  a `div` which contains `data-sveltekit-replacestate`. It will return `options.replace_state` as `true` This is working as expected.\r\n\r\nBut we have a problem, because whever we click, the logic of only updating the hash will update.That will trigger the `pushHistory` Which is the following\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/5191e165b75f5616bd6b4aadf9d8a6c52e75c562/packages/kit/src/runtime/client/client.js#L1564-L1592\r\n\r\nEven if `options.replace_state` is `true`, it will always enter this `if` condition and `push` the `store` because of the `stores.page.set`. It will never reach the expected `navigate` function which has the logic of triggering the `replaceHistory`. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the function that is expected to replace the state with replaceState\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/5191e165b75f5616bd6b4aadf9d8a6c52e75c562/packages/kit/src/runtime/client/client.js#L1580-L1593\r\n\r\nOne way of dealing with this is to check in the `if` condition the options.replace_state:\r\n```javascript\r\nif (\r\n      hash !== undefined &&\r\n      nonhash === location.href.split('#')[0] &&\r\n      !options.replace_state\r\n    ) \r\n``` \r\n\r\nIn that way we can assure that if we trigger the `data-sveltekit-replacestate`  the store will never push. It will reach the navigate function which is in charge of the logic of replacing the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1487959921/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vicentematus","id":38754555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzU0NTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38754555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus","html_url":"https://github.com/vicentematus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"vicentematus","id":38754555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzU0NTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38754555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus","html_url":"https://github.com/vicentematus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-29T21:17:39Z","updated_at":"2023-03-29T21:17:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9548","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9548/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9548/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9548/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9548","id":1644425813,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c5NGBN3","number":9548,"title":"fix:

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`.
