Changing the types may be a breaking change. I *think* it'd be preferred just to change the docs, but am not a TypeScript expert\n\n### Reproduction\n\n`npm create svelte@latest myapp`. Create `src/hooks.server.js` containing the example code from the docs\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nlatest\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7867/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7867/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
