Essentially, this...\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a href=\"/\" data-sveltekit-reload>\r\n  Homepage\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\n...results in the following markup in your Next app (note the `=\"true\"`):\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a href=\"/\" data-sveltekit-reload=\"true\">\r\n  Homepage\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn HTML, an attribute without an explicit value defaults to the empty string.

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts.

Describe the problem\n\nI had a follow-up thought about https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6914. In cases where people are using SvelteKit to generate embeds that sit in a larger application, it's necessary to come up with elaborate workarounds to prevent clicks in the main app nav (for example) being handled by SvelteKit's router.\r\n\r\nIf we instead only listened for click events coming from inside the part of the app SvelteKit controls, it would be very easy to embed SvelteKit apps elsewhere.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nI'm pretty sure we would just need to replace https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/93712f09e955c1d9c8d8d7f838fa56d98290251a/packages/kit/src/runtime/client/client.js#L1393 and other calls to `addEventListener(...)` with `target.addEventListener(...)`.\r\n\r\nThe only downside I can see is that links inside `src/app.html` outside `%sveltekit.body%` wouldn't trigger the client-side router, but a) you can work around it if you really need to with `goto`, and b) i would be astonished if anyone was doing that. Technically a breaking change, of course, so we should do this quickly if we intend to do it at all.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7763/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7763/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1434617478","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6914#issuecomment-1434617478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6914","id":1434617478,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5VgoaG","user":{"login":"mandrasch","id":777278,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NzI3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/777278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandrasch","html_url":"https://github.com/mandrasch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandrasch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandrasch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandrasch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandrasch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandrasch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandrasch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandrasch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandrasch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mandrasch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-17T12:59:41Z","updated_at":"2023-02-17T13:01:19Z","body":"For anyone finding this via search engine (like myself), the option is documented is here: [Routing](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/glossary#routing) and [Link options: data-sveltekit-reload](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/link-options#data-sveltekit-reload).

Describe the problem\n\nI noticed while writing https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13444 that you can't super easily build an MPA with SvelteKit today. One use case I have for this is a site where I have only a single page and so the router is unnecessary overhead. When I mentioned the option in another thread, @theetrain @khromov and @paoloricciuti expressed that it would be useful/cool option to have\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nA `router` option\n\nI think disabling the router would also disable functionality associated with the router such as the before and after navigate callbacks. This is much simpler than creating a separate MPA implementation that provides those. That could always be done down the road if there is demand, but I don't think as many people are going to want those and it doesn't need to block the feature.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNote that we already have 'csr` for client-side rendering so we should avoid using that acronym for client-side routing\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13445/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":5},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13445/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
