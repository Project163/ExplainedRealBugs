The error happens very early on in the experience, so it felt somewhat overwhelming, and like a possible indication that maybe it was just too early to be working in the static side of Svelte. This feeling might affect others with the issue, as well.\r\n\r\nAs for making it more obvious... here’s my two cents:\r\n\r\nPart of what confused me is that the suggested solution acted as if the file were _already there,_ which it wasn’t. I had to add `layout.js` to `src/routes/+layout.js` with the prerender setting. \r\n\r\n>  - add `export const prerender = true` to your root `+layout.js/.ts` or `+layout.server.js/.ts` file. This will try to prerender all pages.\r\n\r\nBecause there wasn’t yet a file there – but the suggestion acted as if it were, and the filename was so similar to a file that did exist – I thought it must be referring to the existing file, `+layout.svelte`.\r\n\r\nPotentially, the build could check whether `+layout.js` exists yet, and suggest adding it if it doesn’t. Short of that, the docs for adapter-static could perhaps suggest this.\r\n\r\nFurther, I was initially confused by the specific way the error refers to `+layout.js/.ts` in the context of the full error traceback. I think my brain interpreted this as possibly meaning that the file might also have a `.svelte` extension, though in hindsight, that seems silly.\r\n\r\n> As mentioned in the issue template, please provide a clonable repo, not a list of instructions to follow.\r\n\r\nSorry! I meant to do this, but had a meeting coming up, but I had to file this issue to figure this out today... and my mind went a bit fuzzy. I will be sure to do this next time around.\r\n\r\nTo make this more obvious, the headline for that section could perhaps be \"Reproduction Repo.\" But, yes, that was my bad.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for the help, everyone! I love Svelte, and I really appreciate the thoughtful design of its developer experience.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1294152254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"arrowtype","id":45946693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTQ2Njkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45946693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype","html_url":"https://github.com/arrowtype","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7686173938,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c5VAQvFzwAAAAHKIbTy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7686173938","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-27T22:09:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7686173945,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5VAQvFzwAAAAHKIbT5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7686173945","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-27T22:09:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1294199227","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7411#issuecomment-1294199227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7411","id":1294199227,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5NI-m7","user":{"login":"arrowtype","id":45946693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTQ2Njkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45946693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype","html_url":"https://github.com/arrowtype","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arrowtype/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-27T22:37:44Z","updated_at":"2022-10-27T22:37:59Z","body":"Update:

I feel overall that the docs are generally geared towards using dynamic content from a server, so often will not be explicit with requirements for a static site which needs multiple routes. I also feel that pages like Routing could use images and diagrams to explain the process for visual learners. \r\n\r\nAnother close read of that page on Routing, for example doesn't discuss the differences between JS in`<script>` or `<script type=\"module\">` in a `+page.svelte` file and JS in a corresponding `+page.js`. It mentions that the `onLoad` \"runs on the server during server-side rendering and in the browser during client-side navigation\", but that you need to \"rename +page.js to +page.server.js\" if \"your load function can only run on the server\" which makes it further confusing. \r\n\r\nAfter looking across the web for better discussions I found this documentation on [script](https://kit-docs-demo.vercel.app/docs/component-format/script) and [script module](https://kit-docs-demo.vercel.app/docs/component-format/module) which was helpful, but again does not mention the `.js` files. \r\n\r\nIn my case, I found this issue because I had placed `export const prerender = true;` inside `+layout.svelte` and the warning `export const prerender will be ignored — move it to +layout(.server).js/ts instead.` was confusing. Why would I use a server side script if I was building for SSG? If the `+layout.js` is not a server side script, and code I put inside the `.svelte` file isn't the right place, then what exactly is this file? I recall visiting this [Project structure](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/project-structure) page several times trying to find an answer to this question. The warning could be more clear if it was explicit that I had options like: `move it to +layout.js/ts or +layout.server.js/ts` instead, and the Project structure page could include a section that discussed (perhaps visually?) what the specific locations for JS/TS mean and yield. I am comparing Astro to SvelteKit at the moment, which has an entire page dedicated to the structure and effects of [Components](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1877161460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"omundy","id":279945,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTk0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/279945?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omundy","html_url":"https://github.com/omundy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omundy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omundy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omundy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omundy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omundy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omundy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omundy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omundy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omundy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11390443398,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c5VAQvFzwAAAAKm7F-G","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/11390443398","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-04T14:15:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11390443417,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5VAQvFzwAAAAKm7F-Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/11390443417","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-04T14:15:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
