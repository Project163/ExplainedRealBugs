The Problem\r\n\r\nThe current SvelteKit Reroute functionality doesn't support dynamic rerouting for localization where settings are stored in a database.\r\n\r\n## The solution?\r\n\r\nModify the Reroute function to return `MaybePromise<void | string>` and update its implementation in `server/response.js` and `client/client.js`. \r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport type { Reroute } from '@sveltejs/kit';\r\n\r\nexport const reroute: Reroute = async ({ url }) => {\r\n    if (url.pathname.startsWith('/api')) {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    const response = await

Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13186/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15695927476,"node_id":"COE_lADOEiPr8c6jgjGfzwAAAAOnjNi0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/15695927476","actor":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-18T01:58:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16196511060,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c6jgjGfzwAAAAPFYyVU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/16196511060","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6071077e607fc7bc4e0a88109fb02fed15ff2907","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/6071077e607fc7bc4e0a88109fb02fed15ff2907","created_at":"2025-02-05T15:22:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-05T15:22:32Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T15:22:32Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13422","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13422/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13422/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13422/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/13422","id":2833255707,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c6KKEsf","number":13422,"title":"feat:
