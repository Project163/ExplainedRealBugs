SPA is not the recommended route, but for some people like me - I have to use SPA given some library.\r\n\r\nI believe Kit can potentially get more adoption from developers from frameworks like Angular (and maybe React, Vue) who don't use meta-frameworks - so drilled in SPA working -  but want to use the great DX from Svelte nevertheless. \r\n\r\nGoing into Kit, while coming from such SPA thinking is a bit steeper learning curve. So, maybe good to spend a bit of time describing SPA setup and common pitfuls working with SPA in Kit (like sometimes needing to import libraries in onMount).\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nI would like to see page https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/edit/master/documentation/docs/13-page-options.md - or some other page - containing a comprehensive description on how to setup SPA in svelte. Previous documentation did mention it a bit better.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if the maintainers also wish to provide some specific guidance for people moving from other frameworks. And if not, a SPA guide may help bloggers/vloggers to write some. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nPosting Q&A's on Reddit, asking questions on Twitter, including tagging Svelte team members.\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7269/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
