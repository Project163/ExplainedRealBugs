https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/9982\r\n\r\nThis PR reinforces the behaviour of always redirecting `/base` to `/base/` in https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9343 by:\r\n\r\n* fixing the client-side trailing slash redirect incorrectly redirecting from `/base/` to `/base` (because no trailing slash option is set).\r\n* when running `vite preview` and visiting the prerendered root page without the trailing slash `/base`, correctly redirect to the trailing slash path `/base/`.\r\n* keep search params intact for `vite preview` trailing slash redirect\r\n\r\nDebating adding a test for this because it would require setting up another test project just to test the behaviour of prerendering a root page with paths.base set.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`.
