I get `undefined` when I $inspect `params` and the server 500s when I try to access a param.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. `sv create test`\n   - Choose minimal option\n   - Choose typescript option\n   - Skip add-ons\n   - Use pnpm\n2. Create a `src/routes/[x]/+page.svelte` file with the following content\n\n```\n<script>\n\tlet { params } = $props();\n</script>\n\n<p>x: {params.x}</p>\n```\n\n3. Run `pnpm dev`\n4. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/test\n5. Notice the server gives a 500 error `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')`\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\n\n```\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\n    OS: Linux 6.6 Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS 24.04.2 LTS (Noble Numbat)\n    CPU: (12) x64 AMD Ryzen 5 5600X 6-Core Processor\n    Memory: 22.29 GB / 31.31 GB\n    Container: Yes\n    Shell: 5.9 - /usr/bin/zsh\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 22.17.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.1/bin/node\n    Yarn: 1.22.22 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.1/bin/yarn\n    npm: 10.9.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.1/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 10.13.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.1/bin/pnpm\n  npmPackages:\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^6.0.0 => 6.0.1\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^2.22.0 => 2.25.0\n    @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte: ^6.0.0 => 6.1.0\n    svelte: ^5.0.0 => 5.36.7\n    vite: ^7.0.4 => 7.0.5\n```\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14011/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
