Describe the bug\r\n\r\nAccording to [docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$app-navigation-beforenavigate) \r\n> \"When navigating to an external URL, navigation.to will be null.\"\r\n\r\nHowever this is not the case as far as I can see. First `beforeNavigate` is called twice, which is confusing as mentioned [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6726#issue-1368751977) and when type is `link` then `navigation.to` is rather an object `{params: null, routeId: null, url: URL, …}` when navigating to an external url. This might be the intended behaviour (having the external URL there, but having routeid being null makes sense?) but it is not what the docs say. Or am I reading it wrong?\r\n\r\nAlso. For debugging purposes I tried to run `JSON.stringify(args)` and got `Uncaught Error: The navigation shape changed - from.toJSON should now be from.url.toJSON`. Don't know if it's me who am doing something illegal but it felt weird. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-sk29dg?file=src/routes/+layout.svelte\r\n\r\n1. Go to link\r\n2. Open browser log\r\n3. Click on link `visit kit.svelte.dev to learn SvelteKit`\r\n4.

preference).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1247106719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7388201559,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c5RlX9pzwAAAAG4XwJX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7388201559","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-14T17:47:58Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7388201924,"node_id":"MIE_lADOEiPr8c5RlX9pzwAAAAG4XwPE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7388201924","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-14T17:48:01Z","milestone":{"title":"1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7388847867,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5RlX9pzwAAAAG4aN77","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7388847867","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4dd0664ff8e4e22595c500953f62f1e2342eb339","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltej

What would be wrong with that?!\r\n\r\n> In both these cases the navigation has to do its first steps in order to determine that it shouldn't do a client side navigation. Question is if we defer calling beforeNavigate and updating $navigating until after that, or if we treat these as internal navigations and don't call beforeNavigate in beforeunload again (the latter is probably my preference).\r\n\r\nWhat I personally prefer is actually for `beforeNavigate` and `afterNavigate` to just be specific to client-side navigation, and if anyone wants to also listen for `load` and `unload` they could very easily do so by registering event handlers for the said events on `window`. I never really liked the idea of `beforeNavigate` and `afterNavigate` also firing for native browser navigations — and I have voiced this in the past — when there's already built-in events for that. Currently, in most cases you just have to do an annoying `if (type == 'unload') return;` or whatever in your handlers all the time.\r\n\r\nBut if that's a non-starter for you, then at the very least this all should be refined before 1.0. I think the approach I proposed (that is, having `unload`/`load` as separate boolean flags alongside `type`) is more sensible than the current one.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1247969023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aradalvand","id":26527405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTI3NDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26527405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand","html_url":"https://github.com/aradalvand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aradalvand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7394043166,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c5RlX9pzwAAAAG4uCUe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7394043166","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-15T11:24:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7394043171,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5RlX9pzwAAAAG4uCUj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7394043171","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-15T11:24:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7743405211,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5RlX9pzwAAAAHNivyb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7743405211","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-04T19:25:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7743405243,"node_id":"REFE_lADO
