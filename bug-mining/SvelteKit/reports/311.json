Reason: The generated `tsconfig.json` contains `\"baseUrl\": \".\"`. In the eyes of TS this is a correct import path due to the base path alias, in the eyes of Vite it's not because we don't define such an alias (only `$lib` by default).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure of the best solution here. Maybe we should always add an alias to Vite that resolves `src/..` to `real/path/to/src`.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:                                                    \r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.19044                                \r\n    CPU: (12) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9850H CPU @ 2.60GHz   \r\n    Memory: 13.04 GB / 31.79 GB                              \r\n  Binaries:                                                  \r\n    Node: 16.15.1 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE         \r\n    npm: 8.13.2 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD            \r\n  Browsers:                                                  \r\n    Chrome: 103.0.5060.66                                    \r\n    Edge: Spartan (44.19041.1266.0), Chromium (103.0.1264.44)\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.19041.1566                       \r\n  npmPackages:                                               \r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: 1.0.0-next.78 => 1.0.0-next.78   \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.0.0-next.357 => 1.0.0-next.357          \r\n    svelte: 3.48.0 => 3.48.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
