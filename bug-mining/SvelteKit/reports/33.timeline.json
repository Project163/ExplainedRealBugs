E.g. a SvelteKit user recently reported that they cannot have a URL path of `tests` because the static serving will attempt to serve the `tests` directory (https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4353).\r\n\r\nIt's also caused quite a bit of confusion with the [`publicDir`](https://vitejs.dev/config/#publicdir) and [`base`](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#base) options because files end up being available via multiple URLs. E.g. if you have `public/image.png` you could access it from both `image.png` and `/public/image.png` which has caused a number of users to be confused in the past\r\n\r\nHaving the source in the root directory has caused us issues because the root directory is then watched by Chokidar. The output is placed in a sub-directory within the root directory and having the output file being watched caused problems that were extremely difficult to track down and diagnose. It would be nice if the source lived within a subdirectory (SvelteKit projects use the `src` directory)\r\n\r\nFinally, this has caused a number of people to have security concerns. A lot of people have sensitive files like `.env` in their root project directory. I think we may be special casing `.env` now, but a number of people have also been surprised to find that their files are being served. We've attempted to mitigated this with `server.fs.allow`, but have not yet found that to be a suitable solution. It is currently broken for many SvelteKit projects - though it may be fixed after 2.9 is released (https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/6518). It's also been quite complicated to configure correctly.\r\n\r\n### Suggested solution\r\n\r\nStop serving the root directory. Check that we still correctly serve source maps\r\n\r\n### Alternative\r\n\r\nWe could utilize the `server.fs.allow` config to make certain files unservable. Right now if you take `package.json` off the allow list you will get a 403 and it's impossible to create a middleware that will serve a URL like http://localhost:5173/package.json. But we could remove the 403 message and just continue on or we could serve allowed files, run the other middlewares, and then add a new 403 middleware after `postHooks`. I would recommend also changing the `server.fs.allow` default from the package root to something a bit safer like `['src', publicDir]` and only watching those directories vs the whole project root\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n@patak-dev and @aleclarson both indicated that they found the current behavior strange as well\r\n\r\n### Validations\r\n\r\n- [X] Follow our [Code of
