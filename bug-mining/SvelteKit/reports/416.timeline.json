#9776.\r\n\r\nAdds a new config option, `config.kit.env.privatePrefix`, for setting a private prefix on environment variables. This defaults to `''`.\r\n\r\nTo prevent super-weird and unexpected behaviors, the logic is:\r\n- private: does not begin with public prefix, does begin with private prefix\r\n- public: does begin with public prefix, does not begin with private prefix\r\n\r\nThis has the side benefit of not allowing the two prefixes to be the same.\r\n\r\nNote: Had to create `env.js` utils file so that the utils could be imported into `server/index` -- putting them pretty much anywhere else ended up causing a transitive dependency on some node package somewhere that wasn't compatible with Node 16.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9996/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9665218727,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5kebHWzwAAAAJAF4in","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/9665218727","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-28T14:04:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9665219008,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5kebHWzwAAAAJAF4nA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/9665219008","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"47d8048d3a4fa1562d0917cb23cfae40149cf1b8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/47d8048d3a4fa1562d0917cb23cfae40149cf1b8","created_at":"2023-06-28T14:04:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15943163295,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5kebHWzwAAAAO2SV2f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/15943163295","actor":{"login":"gndzkrkc","id":3319717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTk3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3319717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gndzkrkc","html_url":"https://github.com/gndzkrkc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gndzkrkc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gndzkrkc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gndzkrkc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gndzkrkc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gndzkrkc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gndzkrkc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gndzkrkc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gndzkrkc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gndzkrkc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-15T15:50:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
