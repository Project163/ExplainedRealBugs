what I've been trying: the `hashchange` event emits an special event called [HashChangeEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HashChangeEvent) which contails `newURL` and `oldURL` properties. Whenever we detect a change in the hash, we compare if there has been a change (maybe this is redundant).\r\n\r\nBut whenever i try to update the `store.page` inside the `svelte:hashchange` acts kinda weird. Like there is some kinda race or something.\r\n\r\nLets say we update the page with the new hash on the `hashchange` event:\r\n```javascript\r\naddEventListener('hashchange', (event) => {\r\n    const new_url = new URL(event.newURL);\r\n    const old_url = new URL(event.oldURL);\r\n    // if the hashchange happened as a result of clicking on a link,\r\n    // code here...\r\n\r\n    // If the hash is the only thing that changed via user input, update the hash on the store\r\n    if (new_url.hash != old_url.hash) {\r\n\tstores.page.set({ ...page, url: { ...page.url, hash: new_url.hash } });\r\n\tstores.page.notify();\r\n\treturn;\r\n    }\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAnd this is the  code for `+page.svelte`\r\n```svelte\r\n<script>\r\n\timport { page } from '$app/stores';\r\n\r\n\t$: console.log('Store', $page.url.hash);\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<svelte:window\r\n\ton:hashchange={() => {\r\n\t        console.log($page.url.hash, 'store');\r\n\t\tconsole.log(window.location.hash, 'location');\r\n\t\t\r\n\t}}\r\n/>\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIf we replace `#1` with `#2` in the address bar, **the expected output is `2`**. This is the scenario:\r\n1.  ❗  The `console.log` of $page.url.hash will print: `1`\r\n2. ✅ `console.log` of `window.location.hash` will print: `2`\r\n3. ✅ the reactive `$page.url.hash`  outside of the `hashchange` event will print the correct output: `2`. \r\n\r\nIt's like `hashchange` event is not aware of the store changes? just after the first update of the store it will recognize it.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1486206387/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vicentematus","id":38754555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzU0NTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38754555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus","html_url":"https://github.com/vicentematus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentematus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"GabrielBarbosaGV","id":29243693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MjQzNjkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29243693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBarbosaGV","html_url":"https://github.com/GabrielBarbosaGV","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBarbosaGV/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBarbosaGV/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBarbosaGV/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBarbosaGV/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBarbosaGV/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBarbosaGV/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBarbosaGV/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBarbosaGV/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GabrielBarbosaGV/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-28T17:58:01Z","updated_at":"2023-03-28T17:58:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9548","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9548/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9548/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9548/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9548","id":1644425813,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c5NGBN3","number":9548,"title":"fix:

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI have a component that subscribes to $page.url. On that page, I change some app config that gets saved to the URL search params using `goto` from `$app/navigation` . This all works great. But I'm trying to render other components using that data from the url and they don't update on changes. It seems subscriptions (auto and manual) are broken with the `$page` store, or at least `$page.url`. \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n[Svelte Lab
