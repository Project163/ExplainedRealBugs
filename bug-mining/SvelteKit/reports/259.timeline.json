There are valid use cases for this that don't involve side effects.\r\n\r\nFor context, I'm using [Superforms](https://superforms.rocks/) to create a progressively enhanced HTML form that uses a schema validation library (like zod) for both client-side and server-side validation. To do this, I need to use that library's own `enhance` function:\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<script>\r\n    const { form, enhance } = superForm(form, {\r\n\tvalidators: zod(schema),\r\n\tvalidationMethod: 'onblur',\r\n    });\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<form method=\"GET\" use:enhance></form>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, because Svelte does not support `use:enhance` on `GET` forms, the library doesn't support it either. But I have a legitimate use case for this: My GET form needs to redirect the user to another route on submit (if JS is disabled) and serialize the data in the URL for easy link sharing. A POST request doesn't really make sense in my app and loses out on this native form-serializing behavior.\r\n\r\nWhat's strange is that, as far as I could tell, this POST-only restriction doesn't actually change how Svelte or Superforms work. It seems to be more of a library preference rather than a safeguard against runtime errors. For example, if I edit the DOM by hand and force the form to be GET after my app mounts as an initial POST form, the app works fine and doesn't error.\r\n\r\nAm I perhaps missing an obvious workaround to this?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/2118880911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AleksandrHovhannisyan","id":19352442,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzUyNDQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19352442?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AleksandrHovhannisyan","html_url":"https://github.com/AleksandrHovhannisyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AleksandrHovhannisyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AleksandrHovhannisyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AleksandrHovhannisyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AleksandrHovhannisyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AleksandrHovhannisyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AleksandrHovhannisyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AleksandrHovhannisyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AleksandrHovhannisyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AleksandrHovhannisyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
