2022-07-14T15:41:04Z","body":"I looked into this one a bit today. Essentially this is happening because of a circular dependency in Monaco, and the `traverse` function not adding the dynamic import from the circular dependency to the `imports` Set. For example here is my test component:\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<script>\r\n  import { onMount } from 'svelte';\r\n\r\n  onMount(async () => {\r\n    await import('monaco-editor/esm/vs/language/typescript/monaco.contribution.js');\r\n  });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is my corresponding `.svelte-kit/output/client/_app/manifest.json` file (truncated a bit to make it more clear):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"src/routes/index.svelte\": {\r\n    \"file\": \"immutable/pages/index.svelte-93e06e99.js\",\r\n    \"src\": \"src/routes/index.svelte\",\r\n    \"isEntry\": true,\r\n    \"isDynamicEntry\": true,\r\n    \"imports\": [\r\n      \"_preload-helper-96c8edfa.js\",\r\n      \"_index-06f608d5.js\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"dynamicImports\": [\r\n      \"_monaco.contribution-0af8d1ea.js\"\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"_index-06f608d5.js\": {\r\n    \"file\": \"immutable/chunks/index-06f608d5.js\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"_preload-helper-96c8edfa.js\": {\r\n    \"file\": \"immutable/chunks/preload-helper-96c8edfa.js\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"_monaco.contribution-0af8d1ea.js\": {\r\n    \"file\": \"immutable/chunks/monaco.contribution-0af8d1ea.js\",\r\n    \"isDynamicEntry\": true,\r\n    \"imports\": [\r\n      \"_preload-helper-96c8edfa.js\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"dynamicImports\": [\r\n      \"node_modules/.pnpm/monaco-editor@0.33.0/node_modules/monaco-editor/esm/vs/language/typescript/tsMode.js\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"css\": [\r\n      \"immutable/assets/monaco.contribution-9deb5b7b.css\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"assets\": [\r\n      \"immutable/assets/codicon-c99115f8.ttf\"\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"node_modules/.pnpm/monaco-editor@0.33.0/node_modules/monaco-editor/esm/vs/language/typescript/tsMode.js\": {\r\n    \"file\": \"immutable/chunks/tsMode-d0fba56e.js\",\r\n    \"src\": \"node_modules/.pnpm/monaco-editor@0.33.0/node_modules/monaco-editor/esm/vs/language/typescript/tsMode.js\",\r\n    \"isDynamicEntry\": true,\r\n    \"imports\": [\r\n      \"_monaco.contribution-0af8d1ea.js\",\r\n      \"_preload-helper-96c8edfa.js\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the `traverse` call stack (paths simplified to make it more clear) :\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntraverse('src/routes/index.svelte', true);\r\n  traverse('_monaco.contribution.js', false); // Dynamic, not added to imports Set\r\n    traverse('tsMode.js', false); // Dynamic, not added to imports Set\r\n      traverse('_monaco.contribution.js', false); // Non-dynamic but not added to imports Set because add_js is false\r\n        traverse('tsMode.js', false); // Dynamic, not added to imports Set\r\n           traverse('_monaco.contribution.js', false); // Non-dynamic but not added to imports Set because add_js is false\r\n             traverse('tsMode.js', false); // Dynamic, not added to imports Set\r\n                ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince `tsMode.js` is always dynamically imported from `_monaco.contribution.js` it never gets added to the `imports` Set and thus recurses until the overflow. A quick fix would be modifying `traverse`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// add_js is true at first so the dynamic import is added to the imports Set for all recursive calls\r\nchunk.dynamicImports.forEach((file) => traverse(file, add_js));\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I don't know if we want to add dynamic imports to the `imports` Set like this. @Rich-Harris Any ideas on this? Happy to work on a PR for this with some direction.
