Migration instructions\r\n\r\nMost of the things explained below are migrated automatically using `npx svelte-migrate package`\r\n\r\n### No more generated `package.json`\r\n\r\n`@sveltejs/package` version 2 no longer generates a `package.json` inside the output directory. Instead, you should define the exports manually, as you know best what's the entry points to your library are.\r\n\r\nThe migration script will help you by runing the same logic the previous major version `@sveltejs/package` ran and output an exports map into your root `package.json`. It might look something like this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"your-package-name\".\r\n   ..,\r\n+ \"exports\": {\r\n+     \".\": \"./package/index.js\",\r\n+     \"./package.json\": \"./package.json\",\r\n+     \"./SomeComponent.svelte\": \"./package/SomeComponent.svelte\"\r\n+  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to review the exports map carefully and familiarize yourself with how it works in general (more on that in the [documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/packaging)). You also might want to clean up the exports map and for example only provide one entry point, the root - probably a good fit for most packages. Note that this would be a breaking change, so if you do this, make sure you do that in a major version release.\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep copying your `package.json` over, you can do this through a simple custom script that you would invoke after `svelte-package`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport fs from 'fs';\r\n\r\n// read file into JSON\r\nconst pkg = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('package.json', 'utf-8'));\r\n\r\n// adjust pkg json however you like ..\r\n\r\n// write it to your output directory\r\nfs.writeFileSync(\r\n  './package/package.json', // path to your output directory may vary\r\n  JSON.stringify(pkg, null, 2)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `typesVersions`\r\n\r\nYou'll probably notice a new `typesVersions` field in your `package.json`. It's needed so TypeScript knows where to find deep imports like `your-library/deep/import`. You can read more about it [in the docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/packaging#typescript).\r\n\r\n### Output directory changed to `dist`\r\n\r\nPreviously, the output was written to `package` by default. It's now written to `dist` by default. You can adjust this behavior through the CLI flag `-o`/`--output`. Example: `svelte-package -o package`.\r\n\r\nThe migration script will adjust any `svelte-package` invocations in your `package.json`'s script so it's written to your current output directory (`package` by default). Consider adjusting your setup so the output is written to `dist` instead.\r\n\r\n### No more configuration options through `svelte.config.js`\r\n\r\nThe configuration options from `svelte.config.js` were removed in favor of CLI flags from the `svelte-package` command.\r\n\r\n- `package.source` is now `-i`/`--input`\r\n- `package.dir` is now `-o`/`--output`\r\n- `package.emitTypes` is now `-t`/`--types`\r\n- `package.exports` is removed in favor of manually authoring the exports map (also see section above)\r\n- `package.files` is removed. If you don't want some files to appear in the package, add an `.npmignore` file\r\n\r\nThe migration script will remove it from your `svelte.config.js` automatically. If you have scripts elsewhere that make use of some the options (like input or output), you need to adjust them manually.\r\n\r\n## PR description\r\n\r\n#8825. Very WIP.\r\n\r\n- closes #6864 \r\n- closes #7258 \r\n- closes #6824\r\n- closes #4828 \r\n\r\n* [x] get tests passing\r\n* [ ] add package validation (ensure that `pkg.exports` points at files inside the output directory, and that there's a `svelte` condition present so that vite-plugin-svelte is able to automatically `noExternal` Svelte libraries\r\n* [x] docs\r\n* [x] migration script\r\n* [x] list all the issues and PRs that will be closed by this\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8922/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8922/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1435482089","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/9097#issuecomment-1435482089","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9097","id":1435482089,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5Vj7fp","user":{"login":"braebo","id":55504972,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTA0OTcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55504972?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/braebo","html_url":"https://github.com/braebo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braebo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braebo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braebo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braebo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braebo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braebo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braebo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braebo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/braebo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-18T04:41:58Z","updated_at":"2023-02-18T04:41:58Z","body":"Technically, it makes sense that this:\r\n> Add a `svelte` condition to your `exports`\r\n\r\nWould mean `exports.svelte`.

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`.
