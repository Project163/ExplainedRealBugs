My `ìndex.svelte` is a pretty basic file that has a redirect in it, redirecting to the first page of my website (which in my case is `/introduction/welcome`): \r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<script context=\"module\" lang=\"ts\">\r\n  import type { LoadInput, LoadOutput } from '@sveltejs/kit'\r\n\r\n  export function load({ stuff }: LoadInput): LoadOutput {\r\n    return {\r\n      status: 302,\r\n      redirect: '/introduction/welcome',\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn version `next.227`, my website could be successfully built and all the html files were built. Starting from `next.228`, the build step no longer takes the redirect from `index.svelte`  and doesn't render the rest of the website. I am almost certain it is linked to [this commit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4761/files), but I am not entirely sure. \r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n- I use `svelte-static` adapter\r\n- I have a customized `paths.base` configuration\r\n- `index.svelte` redirects to another page \r\n   -  in my case, the rest of my website is based on dynamic paths. Since the redirect is not handled, my website html files are not generated at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nI've made a minimal reproduction example: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pelletier197/sveltekit-bug-reproduction\r\n\r\nIn case it may be useful, my full project is public and available [here](https://github.com/magidoc-org/magidoc/tree/main/packages/starters/carbon-multi-page).\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.17 Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS\r\n    CPU: (12) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\n    Memory: 19.35 GB / 31.00 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /usr/bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.14.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.17 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.1.4 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 96.1.33.106\r\n    Chrome: 101.0.4951.41\r\n    Firefox: 100.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-static: 1.0.0-next.30 => 1.0.0-next.30 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.0.0-next.330 => 1.0.0-next.330 \r\n    svelte: ^3.48.0 => 3.48.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nblocking an upgrade\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4927/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4927/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
