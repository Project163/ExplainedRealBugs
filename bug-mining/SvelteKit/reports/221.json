The build doesn't fail, so it's not a critical bug, but I wonder why this happens. I was able to reproduce it but I didn't have time to pinpoint the version where this started to happen.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/f-elix/sveltejs-kit-template-default-t2lbx4\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-t2lbx4?file=src%2Froutes%2Fabout%2F%2Bpage.js,src%2Fhooks.server.ts,package.json&terminal=dev\r\n\r\n(See `hooks.server.ts` where I `console.log(event.url.searchParams)`).\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.6\r\n    CPU: (12) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\n    Memory: 290.99 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.17.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.17.0/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.15.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.17.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 106.0.5249.119\r\n    Firefox: 79.0\r\n    Safari: 16.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-vercel: 1.0.0-next.81 => 1.0.0-next.81 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.0.0-next.529 => 1.0.0-next.529 \r\n    svelte: 3.52.0 => 3.52.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7458/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
