Describe the problem\n\nI use sveltekit in a micro-frontend like usage, injecting html and js generated by svelte-kit in another website.\r\nI used `router=false` option to avoid sveltekit to interfere with the router of the receiving site but keep hydration to activate some js interaction.\r\n\r\nSince [this PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/6446) was merged I should use this to keep same usage:\r\n\r\n> old: router = false / hydrate = true -> new: csr = true + set data-sveltekit-reload if you want native navigations\r\n\r\nUnfortunately receiving site links like `<a href=\"/\">Homepage</a>` are still caught by sveltekit router even if I set `data-sveltekit-reload` in `<html>` tag of the receiving site.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nBring back another configuration field `router` set to true by default. \r\nAs `csr` and `ssr` fields add a way to configure this new field in `page.js` or `layout.js`\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\ni cannot use SvelteKit without it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI don't have all the history of the changes of `router` field, I hope this issue was not already studied. \r\nIt was a very convenient feature for me, I hope I can find a solution.\r\nI can make the PR with proposed solution if needed.","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6914/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6914/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
