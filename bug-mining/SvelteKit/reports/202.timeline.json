Describe the bug\r\n\r\nAttempting to `fetch` from +page.ts fails. The original error I came across said `Failed to get the 'credentials' property on 'Request': the property is not implemented.`\r\n\r\nI posted about this in the Cloudflare Discord and the finger was pointed at https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5116/files.\r\n\r\nIn the [original issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5109) it was stated \"At the time this hack was added, the workers runtime didn't support the credentials header set on a request - this looks to be support now\" but the Cloudflare people on the Discord don't agree with this.\r\n\r\nI made a minimal test repo, although in this case the error is different: `Failed to get the 'mode' property on 'Request': the property is not implemented.`\r\n\r\nI haven't tested this when publishing via Wrangler, but they share the same runtime so I would expect it to be broken in that case too.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n**tl;dr**: Publish https://github.com/Deebster/sveltekit-broken-fetch on Cloudflare Pages.\r\n\r\n### Full steps\r\n\r\nIn Github:\r\n* Fork https://github.com/Deebster/sveltekit-broken-fetch\r\n\r\nIn Cloudflare:\r\n* Go to Pages\r\n* Create a project > Connect to Git\r\n* Select repo\r\n* In \"Build settings\":\r\n  * Set \"Framework preset\" to \"SvelteKit\"\r\n  * Add Environment variable `NODE_VERSION` with value `16`\r\n* Click \"Save and Deploy\"\r\n\r\nIn browser:\r\n* View [webpage](https://sveltekit-broken-fetch.pages.dev/).\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nError: Failed to get the 'mode' property on 'Request': the property is not implemented.\r\n    at fetch

Describe the bug\n\nI'm hosting a project on Cloudflare Pages, and in some endpoints, I'm using multipart requests to send files to the server. Behaviour is not the same locally and in production, so I decided to simulate Cloudflare environment with wrangler.\r\n\r\nWhat I found was that the file sent is processed differently in both environments. Locally it is a normal File, however, in production, it is a string. Below I'll attach both outputs from `console.log`\r\n\r\nLocal:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  profilePic: File {},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nProduction:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n  profilePic: '�PNG\\r\\n' +\r\n    '\\x1A\\n' +\r\n    '\\x00\\x00\\x00\\rIHDR\\x00\\x00\\x00�\\x00\\x00\\x00�\\b\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00$`\\x0F�\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x19tEXtSoftware\\x00Adobe ImageReadyq�e<\\x00\\x00\\x1E�IDATx��]\\tx\\x14E�drN\\x12\\x12B\\x12��\\b\\x04�p]\\x0E�C��\\x14\\br�? ����!\\x1E(\"*����*,\\b\\b\\x02�\\n' + ...\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-blmugs?file=package.json\r\n\r\nSome problems when requesting the endpoint but the point is there.\r\nThe best way to reproduce this is to run this project twice, one with `npm run dev` and other with `wrangler` (after running `npm run build` with `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare`) with this command: `wrangler pages dev --port 3002 .svelte-kit/cloudflare/`\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.6\r\n    CPU: (12) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\n    Memory: 326.18 MB / 16.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 3.5.1 - /usr/local/bin/fish\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.9.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.19.1 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 105.0.5195.125\r\n    Safari: 15.6.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.80 \r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare: ^1.0.0-next.38 => 1.0.0-next.38 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.0.0-next.450 => 1.0.0-next.450 \r\n    svelte: ^3.50.1 => 3.50.1 \r\n    vite: ^3.1.6 => 3.1.6\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI'm using version 450 because of #6739 which makes it impossible for me to use the latest version of SvelteKit. It would be interesting to test this with the latest version of SvelteKit to see if it is still a current problem or was already fixed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7186/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7186/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7548720765,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5RmnSgzwAAAAHB8FZ9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7548720765","actor":{"login":"The-Noah","id":35819660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODE5NjYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35819660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah","html_url":"https://github.com/The-Noah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"adaffd429775db77f6e483a61e553cf9e30fb4f2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/The-Noah/sveltekit/commits/adaffd429775db77f6e483a61e553cf9e30fb4f2","created_at":"2022-10-09T01:50:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"The-Noah","id":35819660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODE5NjYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35819660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah","html_url":"https://github.com/The-Noah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/The-Noah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-09T01:57:49Z","updated_at":"2022-10-09T01:57:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7192","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7192/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7192/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7192/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/7192","id":1402118537,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c5AcQo5","number":7192,"title":"[fix]

Describe the bug\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not sure who to raise this issue with. Cloudflare's `Request` object does not implement the `mode` specification which is being leveraged by the fetch implementation that is passed to the `handleFetch` hook.\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Failed to get the 'mode' property on 'Request': the property is not implemented.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis obviously makes this hook completely unusable on cloudflare workers, and therefore, i'm assuming the same is the case on vercel edge functions.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nImplement the `handleFetch` server hook.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.3.1\r\n
