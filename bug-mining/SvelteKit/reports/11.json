The current behavior is to check if the port is free and if not, provide some info for tracking down the app which is using it.\r\nYou can also provide a \r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nCommands that use a port should gracefully handle cases where it's occupied.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a user runs the `dev` command with no arguments the default port of `3000` is selected. Using a library like `get-port` SvelteKit can check if port `3000` is available. If it's not available then it can try `3001`, `3002` and so on. If none of those ports are free after 10 or so attempts it can fall back to just picking a random port.\r\n\r\nThis change would then allow the `check_port()` function to be unnecessary since there will never be a case where every port on the system is occupied.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI think the general idea for implementing this will stay the same, although there are a number of ways you could tweak the implementation. For example, erroring if a port can't be found in 10 tries, printing a warning if the desired port was occupied, etc.\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to implement this change if you maintainers think it would be helpful for DX.","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4018/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
