If it's a history traversal, it's also useful to know the delta (or at least whether we're going forward or back).\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nSince the types are mutually exclusive, it probably makes sense to be an enum, rather than\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ load: true, goto: false, ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nor something of that nature. Delta can be reported in a separate property that would only apply in the `popstate` case:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nbeforeNavigate(({ from, to, type, delta }) => {\r\n  if (delta) {\r\n    console.log(`travelling ${delta < 0 ? 'backwards' : 'forwards'} through time`);\r\n  } else switch (type) {\r\n    case 'unload': console.log('bye for now'); break;\r\n    case 'click': console.log('clickety clack'); break;\r\n    case 'goto': console.log('as you wish'); break;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`load` isn't pictured because it would never be fired in the `beforeNavigate` case, just like `unload` would never appear in `afterNavigate`.)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6517/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6517/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
