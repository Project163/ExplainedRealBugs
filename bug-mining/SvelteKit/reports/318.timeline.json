Describe the problem\n\nFrom what I've seen and tested (please correct me), sites deployed via Cloudflare Pages still process prerendered pages (`export const prerender = true;`) and static assets through `_worker.js`. This means that even requests to static resources contribute to the host's \"function calls\" budget.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\n[This recently updated Cloudflare doc](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/billing/#will-requests-to-assets-be-charged) indicates that `_routes.json` can be used to bypass `_worker.js`, which typically handles all requests. By restructuring the build output folder (to serve static assets as they are normally routed in-app), we could take advantage of this feature. This would make adapter-cloudflare infinitely more viable for high traffic sites.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- Using adapter-static, but that only works if *all* of your site is prerendered.\r\n- Stricter rate limiting, but that's not scalable, reliable, or customizable (4 rules max on Cloudflare).\r\n- Maybe surprise outages are OK ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n\n### Importance\n\ni cannot use SvelteKit without it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI understand that traditionally, the contents of the build output folder is not meant to be exposed, and that `_worker.js` is meant to handle *every* request, even for static assets. However, I think that falling back onto Cloudflare Page's built-in file routing would be well worth it if it meant saving *actual* money on hosting costs (or in my case, having my site stay live for the whole day).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7298/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7298/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7825513551,"node_id":"DEME_lADOEiPr8c5WTMJSzwAAAAHSb9xP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7825513551","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-16T15:58:15Z","milestone":{"title":"1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7825513559,"node_id":"MIE_lADOEiPr8c5WTMJSzwAAAAHSb9xX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7825513559","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-16T15:58:15Z","milestone":{"title":"whenever"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1320855573","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7640#issuecomment-1320855573","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7640","id":1320855573,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5OuqgV","user":{"login":"Neicul123","id":7229394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjkzOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7229394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neicul123","html_url":"https://github.com/Neicul123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neicul123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neicul123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neicul123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neicul123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neicul123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neicul123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neicul123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neicul123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Neicul123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-19T10:36:07Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T10:36:07Z","body":"Am I correct in assuming this would also fix the version.json calls from counting towards the quota on CF?
