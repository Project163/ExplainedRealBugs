(Correct ones even though stackblitz can't show them).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure of the issue but what I'm noticing is that the `proxy+page.server.ts` file doesn't not get updated if there isn't a destructured property.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.15 Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa)\r\n    CPU: (16) x64 AMD Ryzen 7 2700X Eight-Core Processor\r\n    Memory: 19.68 GB / 31.28 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.0.17 - /bin/bash\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.16.0 - /usr/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.15 - /usr/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.11.0 - /usr/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 103.0.5060.134\r\n    Chromium: 104.0.5112.79\r\n    Firefox: 103.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.64 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.410 \r\n    svelte: ^3.46.0 => 3.49.0 \r\n    vite: ^3.0.0 => 3.0.8\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5927/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
