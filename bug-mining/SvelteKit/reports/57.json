If the `getSession` hook is intended exclusively for user session data, this combination could easily be misused and is a potential security issue, thus probably shouldn't be possible.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nWhere `maxage` is used, and `getSession` returns anything other than `void`, `cache-control` should be set to `private`.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n`cache-control` could be forced to `private` when any `getSession` hook is implemented. Is there a case for conditionally returning session data only for some routes though? This would allow implementations where some pages could be cached publicly while still using `getSession` for session data on others.\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4268/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
