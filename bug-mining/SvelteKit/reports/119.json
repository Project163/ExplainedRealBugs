As of #6197, these can be set in `+layout[.server].js` files as well as `+page[.server].js` files, which allows us to get rid of the corresponding config options.\r\n\r\n`router` is an anomaly, however. It's the only option that has a meaning after the initial render — if you navigate to a page with `router = false`, it will disable the client-side router altogether. There's no getting around it: this is a deeply weird option that basically no-one needs (to understand why it was introduced in the first place, see https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/6197#issuecomment-1225726404).\r\n\r\nAs of https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/790#issuecomment-1231052222, we'll have a much more sensible approach for disabling the router — `data-sveltekit-reload` applied to a top-level element. This would mean we can get rid of the `router` page option altogether.\r\n\r\nThis does leave a gap though — right now, if `hydrate` and `router` are both `false`, we don't send any JavaScript with the page at all.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nWe merge `hydrate` and `router` into a single `csr` option that controls whether client-side rendering/routing takes place. (It's convenient that the acronym works for both.) If `csr` is `false`, no JS is sent with the page.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, this is less flexible than what we have now, but having one-but-not-both be `true` is both kinda useless and currently buggy. This approach would be much simpler, both in implementation and communication — `prerender`, `ssr` and `csr` are a much more logical trio.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nKeep the current semantics of `hydrate` and always include the client-side router.\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI'm raising this here as an issue rather than a discussion because I expect approximately three people to be affected by this change.","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6436/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6436/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
