this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8046881539,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5ZPwoVzwAAAAHfoasD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8046881539","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-15T12:40:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8046881784,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5ZPwoVzwAAAAHfoav4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8046881784","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3f7af7ac72e390ffa1f59d780a41e5cf71dff852","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/3f7af7ac72e390ffa1f59d780a41e5cf71dff852","created_at":"2022-12-15T12:40:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8080364952,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5ZPwoVzwAAAAHhoJWY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8080364952","actor":{"login":"robBowes","id":32183505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTgzNTA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32183505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robBowes","html_url":"https://github.com/robBowes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robBowes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robBowes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robBowes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robBowes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robBowes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robBowes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robBowes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robBowes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robBowes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"abdbbb0f13dd353db9a183fd167c97c700ca75ba","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robBowes/kit/commits/abdbbb0f13dd353db9a183fd167c97c700ca75ba","created_at":"2022-12-20T17:13:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
