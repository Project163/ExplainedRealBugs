What about rendering the page if `text/html` is accepted, and falling back to `+server.js` in all other cases?\r\n\r\nPending the outcome of https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/5875, what happens if `+page.server.js` specifies `POST` (or `PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`) and these methods are also defined in `+server.js`? Is it the same — use the `+page.server.js` if `text/html` is accepted, and `+server.js` otherwise?

I used `application/json` as it's likely going to be the most common / 90-99% use-case.\r\n\r\nThe overlap between `+page.server.js` and `+server.js` POST / PUT etc... methods is a little confusing, I'm still going through the docs and trying things out but the initial feel is that things overlap and it's not entirely clear why I would want to use one vs the other. But I take it this might already be subject to change with the form / action stuff.\r\n\r\nTaking that into account, I would prefer that `+server.js` be the fallback and it would make more sense if the `+page.actions.js` / `+server.actions.js` (?) is really going to map to a different hidden URL anyway so there wouldn't be any conflict at that

In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts.

With the initial pageload the user gets the first part and then, within the client the user can request further parts without the need to reload the page. Both use the exact same API and DB call.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice to just use the same `+page.server.ts` for this, e.g. with a `{ headers: { accept: 'application/json' } }`. I get super fast initial loads because the API request is preloaded and my code stays clean.\r\n\r\nWhy not `+server.ts`? Then, I'd need another dedicated `+page.ts` with a load function. Before, shadow endpoints gave you the highest flexibility with the least LOC and redundancy.\r\n\r\nNot sure if I miss something and/or this would align well with

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6773/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7415255089,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5P2G-EzwAAAAG5-9Ax","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7415255089","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-19T16:35:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7415255169,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5P2G-EzwAAAAG5-9CB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7415255169","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9ef548a1d26e5d7381592c8a179669d735cbfebd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/9ef548a1d26e5d7381592c8a179669d735cbfebd","created_at":"2022-09-19T16:35:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
