checked my Vercel function logs with the `console.log` deployed and I don't see it, and the font links aren't there as well. I'm not sure why you see your font preload links when deployed, but I don't believe this issue has been fixed yet.

(Such a behaviour is undoubtedly opinionated and would certainly have to be documented)\r\n\r\nSo in your example, while the last handler will likely know whether it wants to preload based on the type, `auth` could add to it that it needs to preload some specific asset like `chunk/public-key.js`, while another imaginary `locale()` handler could add `chunk/translations-es.js`, regardless of whether or not the last handler wants to include `js` assets.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1402216917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"allezxandre","id":5808474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MDg0NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5808474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allezxandre","html_url":"https://github.com/allezxandre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allezxandre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allezxandre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allezxandre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allezxandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allezxandre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allezxandre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allezxandre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allezxandre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allezxandre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1451707022","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/8061#issuecomment-1451707022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8061","id":1451707022,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5Wh0qO","user":{"login":"half2me","id":6759894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTk4OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6759894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/half2me","html_url":"https://github.com/half2me","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/half2me/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/half2me/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/half2me/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/half2me/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/half2me/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/half2me/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/half2me/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/half2me/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/half2me/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-02T11:18:28Z","updated_at":"2023-03-02T11:18:28Z","body":"I

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9741/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9162166992,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5Yuoc8zwAAAAIiG5LQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/9162166992","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-04T02:49:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9162167034,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5Yuoc8zwAAAAIiG5L6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/9162167034","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d8ec10dd517ab31528a64bf63ebb85a0a241d756","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/d8ec10dd517ab31528a64bf63ebb85a0a241d756","created_at":"2023-05-04T02:49:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
