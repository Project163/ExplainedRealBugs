I tried to use vite's `import.meta.env` but that didn't have the required information either unfortunately.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nYou can test this with a `console.log(process.env.NODE_ENV)` in `svelte.config.js`. The bug is that it's `undefined` whereas before it was `development` when run with `npm run dev`.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.6\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-1000NG4 CPU @ 1.10GHz\r\n    Memory: 163.72 MB / 8.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 3.2.57 - /bin/bash\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 17.5.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.17 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.4.1 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 90.1.24.82\r\n    Chrome: 106.0.5249.119\r\n    Edge: 107.0.1418.24\r\n    Firefox: 105.0.3\r\n    Safari: 16.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.85\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-static: ^1.0.0-next.46 => 1.0.0-next.46\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.526\r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.52.0\r\n    vite: ^3.1.0 => 3.2.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nblocked\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7417/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
