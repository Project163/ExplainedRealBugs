Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10558/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10167913154,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5uCUhLzwAAAAJeDgrC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/10167913154","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-08-23T09:40:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10167913409,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5uCUhLzwAAAAJeDgvB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/10167913409","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7c37a2fb3bff0f47f817bc8049b454abe591b8a0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/7c37a2fb3bff0f47f817bc8049b454abe591b8a0","created_at":"2023-08-23T09:40:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1721272008","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/10528#issuecomment-1721272008","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10528","id":1721272008,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5mmIbI","user":{"login":"205g0","id":74575852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTc1ODUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74575852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/205g0","html_url":"https://github.com/205g0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/205g0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/205g0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/205g0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/205g0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/205g0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/205g0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/205g0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/205g0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/205g0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-15T13:19:41Z","updated_at":"2023-09-15T13:20:07Z","body":"Would

I just want that my app breaks as much as possible if my SQL schema (=Drizzle TS schema) changes. And I want to know ofc where it broke. I achieved this already with almost everything which is entity- and/or route-related, e.g.. depends, invalidate, goto, fetch, action, href, etc. This is the beauty with TS, you can easily change a table name with Drizzle, let TS refactor and where it can't, it will break at least.\r\n\r\nIf the routes/folder names break too (or emit an error on the console), you would have a complete \"picture\" where to refactor yourself and can do complex refactors in minutes you couldn't do with any other framework in weeks.\r\n\r\nAtm, I just check against an enum type of all SQL entities, so no hierarchy or relations are checked but this is already a huge win.
