Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI've been thinking a lot about the `beforeNavigate` interface, as you can see by my recent issues:\r\n\r\n- #8605\r\n- #8597\r\n- #8482\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose breaking `beforeNavigate` up into two methods: `beforeUnload` and `beforeNavigate`. This would help simplify the documentation and make it explicit in how to deal with the different behaviours.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nHere's what the documentation could look like (and thus, influence the logic)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### beforeUnload\r\n\r\nA navigation interceptor that triggers before SvelteKit unloads. Calling `navigation.confirm()` will trigger the native browser unload confirmation dialog.\r\n\r\n`beforeUnload` must be called during a component initialization. It remains active as long as the component is mounted.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nbeforeUnload((navigation: BeforeUnload) => {\r\n  navigation.confirm();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### beforeNavigate\r\n\r\nA navigation interceptor that triggers when navigating to a new URL handled by SvelteKit. Navigation can be resolved or rejected, allowing you to prompt the user for confirmation.\r\n\r\n`beforeNavigate` must be called during a component initialization. It remains active as long as the component is mounted.\r\n\r\n#### Basic example using window.confirm\r\n\r\n```js\r\nbeforeNavigate((navigation: BeforeNavigate) => {\r\n\tif(window.confirm('Are you sure?')){\r\n\t\tnavigation.resolve();\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tnavigation.reject();\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Using a custom interface\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script lang=\"ts\">\r\n\tlet attemptedNavigation: BeforeNavigate | undefined;\r\n\tbeforeNavigate((navigation: BeforeNavigate) => {\r\n\t\tattemptedNavigation = navigation;\r\n\t});\r\n\tconst cancel = () => {\r\n\t\tattemptedNavigation.reject();\r\n\t\tattemptedNavigation = undefined;\r\n\t}\r\n\tconst confirm = () => {\r\n\t\tattemptedNavigation.resolve();\r\n\t\tattemptedNavigation = undefined;\r\n\t}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n{#if attemptedNavigation}\r\n\t<div>\r\n\t\t<p>Are you sure?</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t<button on:click={cancel}>Cancel</button>\r\n\t\t\t<button on:click={confirm}>Confirm</button>\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</div>\r\n{/if}\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI've purposefully chosen different methods than `navigation.cancel()` so that we can be clear in the change of behaviour.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8625/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8625/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1790317352","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/8482#issuecomment-1790317352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8482","id":1790317352,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5qthMo","user":{"login":"AbstractFruitFactory","id":6748212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDgyMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6748212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbstractFruitFactory","html_url":"https://github.com/AbstractFruitFactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbstractFruitFactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbstractFruitFactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbstractFruitFactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbstractFruitFactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbstractFruitFactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbstractFruitFactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbstractFruitFactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbstractFruitFactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AbstractFruitFactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-02T08:57:36Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T08:57:36Z","body":"Hi, I actually really want this to work for `target=_blank` links.
