Describe the bug\r\n\r\nFor a number of reasons related to platform integration, nytimes wraps sveltekit html output in a template that will occasionally hoist script tags into the `body` tag:\r\n\r\nsrc/hooks.js\r\n```javascript\r\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle} */\r\nexport async function handle({ event, resolve }) {\r\n\treturn resolve(event, {\r\n\t\ttransformPage: ({ html }) => {\r\n                          // wraps the output in the nytimes renderer, which sometimes \r\n                          // hoists script tags contained in html out of the generated component html and into the <body> tag.\r\n\t\t\treturn render_page_in_template(html);\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince [kit now assumes that the mount script is always an immediate child of the root mount node](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/28139749c4bf056d1e04f55e7f955da33770750d/packages/kit/src/runtime/server/page/render.js#L161), this means that kit will mount the `body` node instead of the parentNode defined in app.html template. \r\n\r\nIn practice this means that if we wanted to embed a component generated by kit into the NYTs homepage (which hoists scripts), we're at risk of that component blowing out the entire DOM. \r\n\r\nI really like the ergonomics introduced in https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/3674, but I wonder if instead setting `data-hydrate` on `<script  data-hydrate=\"foo\" />` we set it on a tag that's not vulnerable to hoisting `<div  data-hydrate=\"foo\" />`\r\n\r\nThanks so much for all the amazing work y'all have done so far. And thanks in advance for your wisdom on this. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nIn src/hooks.js write a small script that hoists kit script tags out of their default parent node. \r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.3.1\r\n    CPU: (10) x64 Apple M1 Max\r\n    Memory: 2.44 GB / 64.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 14.18.3 - ~/bin/nvm/versions/node/v14.18.3/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.17 - /opt/homebrew/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.14.15 - ~/bin/nvm/versions/node/v14.18.3/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 100.0.4896.127\r\n    Firefox: 99.0\r\n    Safari: 15.4\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-static: 1.0.0-next.29 => 1.0.0-next.29 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.0.0-next.305 => 1.0.0-next.305 \r\n    @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte: 1.0.0-next.41 => 1.0.0-next.41 \r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.46.4 \r\n    vite: ^2.6.10 => 2.8.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nblocking an upgrade\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4685/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
