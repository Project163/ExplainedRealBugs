To my observation, it only impacts the aliases built by `npx svelte-kit sync` and output to `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json`. This helps with import intellisense and ESLint checks, but Vite apparently is not made aware of the aliases.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Go to https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltekit-alias?file=svelte.config.js&terminal=dev\r\n2. Observe configs in **svelte.config.js**\r\n3. Run `npm run dev` (should start automatically) and note the error\n\n### Logs\n\n```shell\nCannot find module '$components/Hello.svelte' imported from '/home/projects/sveltekit-alias/src/routes/+page.svelte'\n```\n\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.0 undefined\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 0 Bytes / 0 Bytes\r\n    Shell: 1.0 - /bin/jsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.2 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.10 - /bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 7.17.0 - /bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.64 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.413 \r\n    svelte: ^3.46.0 => 3.49.0 \r\n    vite: ^3.0.0 => 3.0.8\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nBy applying aliases in both `svelte.config.js@kit.alias` and `vite.config.js@resolve.alias` I am able to have Typescript and Vite acknowledge my aliases. \r\n\r\nHere is the workaround applied: https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltekit-alias-workaround?file=svelte.config.js,vite.config.js&terminal=dev\r\n\r\nConvenience link to Vite docs: https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#resolve-alias","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5962/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
