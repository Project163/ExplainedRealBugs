In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or

Describe the problem\n\nIn `load` functions, if an error occurs, the nearest `+error.svelte` is rendered.\n\nIn components, however, if an error occurs, the root `+error.svelte` is rendered.\n\nI find this behavior unintuitive and disabling in designing the user experience, having the root business concern \"leak\" into a specialized subconcern of an app.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nI assume there is no reason why the nearest `+error.svelte` could and should not be rendered – the route is known, and therefore the nearest error boundary is known as well.\n\nIf an error in the `load` function of a layout or page will render the nearest error boundary, one in the layout or page component ought to as well.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nA workaround in https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7875#issuecomment-1330615223 is available for 404 errors, but not applicable to other errors.\n\n### Importance\n\ni cannot use SvelteKit without it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nIn lieu of a fix for this behavior, is there a recommended way of rendering the nearest error boundary on rendering errors?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
