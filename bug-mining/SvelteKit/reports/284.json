I had a number of integration tests I had written in `vitest` that are now breaking with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFAIL  tests/integration/hooks.test.ts [ tests/integration/hooks.test.ts ]\r\nError: Cannot import $env/dynamic/private into client-side code\r\n ❯ Context.load node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/exports/vite/index.js:304:12\r\n ❯ Object.load node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-67e7f8ab.js:40201:46\r\n ❯ loadAndTransform node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-67e7f8ab.js:36553:24\r\n```\r\nMy integration tests import a number of back-end modules (eg. database access code, etc...).\r\n\r\nI am surprised by the fact that the integration tests are being treated as client code that is tripping up the server-client serialization safety mechanism.\r\n\r\nI am at a loss as to what to do here. Any recommendations on how to address this issue? Is there any way I can turn off this safety mechanism for my integration tests? Is there something entirely different I should be doing to do database integration tests?\r\n\r\nPS. My reproduction project is using the stock configuration that comes from a new project. It calls the `vitest` tests *unit* tests. I am not sure if I should be reading too much into that. If `vitest` is not the right place for writing these types of tests, what alternatives should I look into?\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe reproduction test illustrates the problem when importing a class that makes a reference to `$env/dynamic/private`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kyllerss/sveltekit-issue-8180\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.15 KDE neon 5.26 5.26\r\n    CPU: (16) x64 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 9.68 GB / 15.34 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.1.16 - /bin/bash\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.18.0 - ~/apps/node-v16.18.0-linux-x64/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.19.2 - ~/apps/node-v16.18.0-linux-x64/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 108.1.46.144\r\n    Chrome: 108.0.5359.124\r\n    Firefox: 108.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^1.0.0 => 1.0.0 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.0.0 => 1.0.0 \r\n    svelte: ^3.54.0 => 3.55.0 \r\n    vite: ^4.0.0 => 4.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nserious, but I can work around it\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8180/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8180/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
