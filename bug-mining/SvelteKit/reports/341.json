Enter `npm run build && node build` in the terminal.\r\n2. Open the preview window in a new tab by clicking `Open in New Tab` in the top-right corner to avoid StackBlitz's automatic reload.\r\n3. Navigate to any other page in the built website.\r\n4. End the current node server instance by entering `ctrl + c` into the terminal.\r\n5. Modify the HTML content in `src/routes/+page.svelte`.\r\n6. Enter `npm run build && node build` into the terminal again.\r\n7. Navigate to the Home page `/` in the website.\r\n\r\n#### Expected\r\n\r\nA native navigation to the home page and the version number at the bottom of the page changes.\r\n\r\n#### Actual\r\n\r\nThe website still displays the old home page until you manually refresh the page.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.0 undefined\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 0 Bytes / 0 Bytes\r\n    Shell: 1.0 - /bin/jsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.2 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 7.17.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: ^1.1.4 => 1.1.4 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.2.6 => 1.2.6 \r\n    svelte: ^3.54.0 => 3.55.1 \r\n    vite: ^4.0.0 => 4.0.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n> Client-side navigation can be buggy if you deploy a new version of your app while people are using it. If the code for the new page is already loaded, it may have stale content; if it isn't, the app's route manifest may point to a JavaScript file that no longer exists. SvelteKit solves this problem by falling back to traditional full-page navigation if it detects that a new version has been deployed, using the name specified here (which defaults to a timestamp of the build).\r\n\r\nhttps://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#version","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8697/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
