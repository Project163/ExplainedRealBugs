Describe the problem\n\nIt is better to use [`aria-current`](aria-current=\"page\") on the main page menu for accessibility, to specify what page is the current one (and the one that is the current, should be with `aria-current=\"page\"`).\r\n\r\nA good side effect is that we can use the `aria-current=\"page\"` as a CSS selector to style the currently active page item.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nUse `aria-current`.\r\n\r\nIn Sapper demo, everything I have just said is implemented in the [old `Nav` component](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template/blob/master/src/components/Nav.svelte), but why not in SvelteKit demos?\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNot doing this :-(\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No
