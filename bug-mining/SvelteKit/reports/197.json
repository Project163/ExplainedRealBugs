Describe the problem\n\nPer https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/7259 — if someone does this...\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { json } from '@sveltejs/kit';\r\n\r\nexport function load() {\r\n  return json({ answer: 42 });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...they will get a cryptic error:\r\n\r\n> DevalueError: Cannot stringify arbitrary non-POJOs\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nIt would be easy to catch this case and provide a more specific error:\r\n\r\n> `load` must return a plain object rather than a `Response`\r\n\r\nFor bonus points, it should identify the `load` function in question.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No
