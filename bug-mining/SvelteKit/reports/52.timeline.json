Describe the problem\n\nSvelteKit doesn't do anything special with environment variables; it delegates to Vite. This is good for the sorts of environment variables Vite deals in — `VITE_` prefixed values that are replaced at build time — but less good for other kinds.\r\n\r\nEnvironment variables can be **static** (known at build time) or **dynamic** (not known until run time), and **private** (only accessible to code that runs on the server) or **public** (accessible to code that runs on the server or the client):\r\n\r\n|                        | static               | dynamic                                  |\r\n|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\r\n| public | ✅ import.meta.env.VITE_* | ❌ (1)                                         |\r\n| private  | ⚠️ can be done with plugins (2)                     | ⚠️ process.env.* (3) |\r\n\r\n1. To be fair, I'm not sure what sorts of things would go in this quadrant, though I would be eager to hear examples\r\n2. You can add something like [plugin-replace](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/replace#readme) to selectively replace things at build time, but this is ad hoc, undiscoverable, and involves duplication between `.env` files and config\r\n3. `process.env` is only available in Node-based environments (e.g. `adapter-node`, `adapter-netlify` and `adapter-vercel` — though once the Vercel adapter starts building Edge Functions that will no longer be the case)\r\n\r\nIt would be great if we had a consistent and idiomatic way of dealing with all of these.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nI don't actually have any proposals to make, I just didn't want https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4293#issuecomment-1065300764 to get lost. Whatever solution we land on should\r\n\r\n* work with `.env`/`.env.*` files\r\n* enable dead code elimination etc at build time\r\n* allow autocompletion/auto-imports (e.g. we could generate typings from your `.env` file)\r\n* feel consistent across the four quadrants, but with clearly understandable distinctions between them (e.g. `$app/env/public` vs `$app/env/private` or whatever)\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4296/reactions","total_count":19,"+1":19,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
