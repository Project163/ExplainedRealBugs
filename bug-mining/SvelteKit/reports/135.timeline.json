#6630. This makes two breaking changes to the `enhance` action:\r\n\r\n1. the input `form` is now `element`, and refers to the element the action was added to. To type that, the function and the SubmissionFunction interface now both take three generic params instead of two.\r\n2. The returned callback is a `({ element, form, data, result }) => {...}` function instead of just `(result) => {...}`. This makes it easier to do things like `use:enhance={() => whatever}`, where `whatever` is a function that (for example) calls `form.reset()`.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7338201590,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5RULrPzwAAAAG1ZBH2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7338201590","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-07T11:54:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7338201811,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5RULrPzwAAAAG1ZBLT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7338201811","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c82d136fe97694f18808332d94c35ee09103fbcd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/c82d136fe97694f18808332d94c35ee09103fbcd","created_at":"2022-09-07T11:54:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"PatrickG","id":196478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjQ3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG","html_url":"https://github.com/PatrickG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-08T00:31:19Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T00:31:19Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6660","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6660/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6660/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6660/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6660","id":1365314920,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c5RYQ1o","number":6660,"title":"`use:enhance`
