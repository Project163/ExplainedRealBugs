I see this as a hurdle for new or inexperienced users.\r\n\r\nAnd I also see it problematic if e.g. for some reasons `__data.json` gets renamed to `__data.json5` or `__data.xml`  in the future to support other content formats. Then the workarounds will no longer work.\r\n\r\n> Here is a small project demonstrating a problematic logging issue: https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-sllc4q?file=src/hooks.server.ts\r\n> 1. Click on the \"page 1\" link\r\n> 2. Reload the page\r\n> 3. See that both requests resulted in different log outputs\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nUse the same `url` object within `hooks.server.ts` (without `/data.json` at the end) and add a new attribute to the `event` object to distinguish between regular requests and data requests.\r\n\r\nThis would mean a breaking change, but the migration process should be fairly simple.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nLeave it as it is\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7926/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
