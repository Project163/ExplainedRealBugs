some additional testing:\r\n\r\n1. The prerendered pages are missing from the output after build, hence the error. (check `/.svelte-kit/output/prerendered/`)\r\n2. Using the prerender option in `+page.ts` and `+layout.ts` instead of `+layout.server.ts` doesn't change anything.\r\n3. Adding a static route to prerender causes the build to properly prerender the dynamic routes as well.\r\nSee [this repo](https://github.com/s3812497/layout-prerender-bug) for the reproduction.\r\n\r\nSomehow the compiler is skipping the dynamic routes for prerender (although there are links referencing them).\r\n\r\nA workaround for @StephenGunn in the mean time is to explicitly specify the dynamic route for prerender via the `svelte.config.js` `prerender` option:\r\n```\r\nimport adapter from \"@sveltejs/adapter-auto\";\r\nimport preprocess from \"svelte-preprocess\";\r\n\r\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */\r\nconst config = {\r\n  // Consult https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess\r\n  // for more information about

:"2022-09-04T22:09:49Z","body":"Thanks for digging around @s3812497, I don't think that solution will work for me. I'll explain why:\r\n\r\nHere is an episode page from the project that lead me to find this bug: https://craftroulette.live/episodes/episode-127\r\n\r\nThe version you're looking at is pre-route migration so everything is working. The layout file for the episode runs a couple of queries against the DB to get the gallery count, guest count, process video count, and extras gallery count and display them in the sidebar. I pre-render the layout on build so that site doesn't have to make those queries every time the episode is loaded.\r\n\r\nHere is the catch, I need to keep some of the sub routes dynamic. So, the Contribution Gallery, Process Videos, and Extras Gallery pages are all dynamic because they allow people to submit to them and I don't want to have to rebuild the entire project after every submission. The numbers on the menu do get out of sync until the next build but that's not a big deal.\r\n\r\nSo as far as I know, I can't just specify the episode to be static because I have dynamic sub-pages.\r\n\r\nI have the site ready to publish with the routing migration done and everything else up-to-date.. but the prerender = true was breaking the sub-routes on that page. It took me a few days to figure out what was going on, and that's when I build the tester project to make sure.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1236423178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"StephenGunn","id":7240548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDA1NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7240548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn","html_url":"https://github.com/StephenGunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7318989955,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5RItu4zwAAAAG0PuyD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7318989955","actor":{"login":"StephenGunn","id":7240548,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDA1NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7240548?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn","html_url":"https://github.com/StephenGunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StephenGunn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-04T22:04:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7318989963,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c5RItu4zwAAAAG0PuyL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7318989963","actor":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-04T22:04:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7318989965,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5RItu4zwAAAAG0PuyN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7318989965","actor":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-04T22:04:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7318990003,"node_id":"REE_lADOEiPr8c5RItu4zwAAAAG0Puyz","url":"https://a
