When using a framework to build interactive tooltips like [popper](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/), we started to see weird behavior.\r\n\r\n We are trying to fix this, by making sure popper attaches \"inside\" the app, instead of doing `document.body.appendChild(...`. Mostly leaving it here, if other people should encounter a similar issue 😎

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nIf a form is rendered outside of SvelteKit's content, and triggers a navigation, the entire page reloads.\r\n\r\nThis might seem like an absurd thing to care about, but a search form inside of a modal, rendered in a portal is a reasonably common occurrence, and exactly how I discovered this. \r\n\r\nIncidentally, form *actions* appear to work fine.
