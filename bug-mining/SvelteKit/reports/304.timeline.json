#8268\r\n\r\nTheoretically someone could have relied on us auto-loading the ambient types previously, but I doubt it because it means that `adapter-cloudflare` would have been imported somewhere where our `tsconfig.json`'s `include` includes it (the `svelte.config.js` isn't), _and_ you'd need to access cloudflare-specific things outside of `platform`. Getting the behavior back as a user is as easy as slapping `/// <reference types=\"@cloudflare/workers-types\" />` at the top of `src/app.d.ts`.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`.
