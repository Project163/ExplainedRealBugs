Current behavior is that the client makes a fetch call to the exposed endpoint during hydration.\n\nCurrently my workaround is to make the query take an argument of v.object({}), and just ignore it. This does require me to call the query everywhere with an argument of {}, but that's only a minor annoyance.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-yk4grqnj?file=src%2Froutes%2Fremote.remote.ts\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\n\n```\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\n    OS: Linux 6.14 Ubuntu 25.04 25.04 (Plucky Puffin)\n    CPU: (12) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10750H CPU @ 2.60GHz\n    Memory: 23.19 GB / 30.59 GB\n    Container: Yes\n    Shell: 5.9 - /usr/bin/zsh\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 24.5.0 - ~/.volta/tools/image/node/24.5.0/bin/node\n    npm: 11.5.1 - ~/.volta/tools/image/node/24.5.0/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 10.14.0 - ~/.volta/bin/pnpm\n    bun: 1.2.2 - ~/.bun/bin/bun\n```\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14562/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
