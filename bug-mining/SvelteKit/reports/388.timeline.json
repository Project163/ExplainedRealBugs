#9341.\r\n\r\nIn #9220, we changed the logic for resolving asset paths to accommodate the `relative: true` option, and included [special handling](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9220/files#r1120243235) for the case where you're rendering the root page when `base` is set — if the base path is `/a/b/c` and you render `/a/b/c`, then the relative path (somewhat counter-intuitively) needs to be `./c` for links to work.\r\n\r\nTurns out that was a mistake, because the root should always end with a trailing slash — if you prerender that page, it will be output as `<output>/index.html`, and relative paths will thus be incorrectly converted to `<output>/c/...`.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to remove the special case handling, and ensure that `/a/b/c` always redirects to `/a/b/c/`. This is much simpler and more correct. It arguably falls into the semver gray zone where someone somewhere might be relying on the buggy behaviour, but I think it's vanishingly unlikely, and in any case the worst that will happen is a URL that used to render something gets turned into a redirect.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9604/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1499321362","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/9341#issuecomment-1499321362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9341","id":1499321362,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5ZXdQS","user":{"login":"mdi22","id":12232700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjMyNzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12232700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdi22","html_url":"https://github.com/mdi22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdi22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdi22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdi22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdi22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdi22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdi22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdi22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdi22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdi22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-06T16:22:48Z","updated_at":"2023-04-06T16:22:48Z","body":">

Describe the bug\n\nThis is what I expect:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110659061/224484868-b59c3c28-2e5a-41a5-b6c7-7810cef0b4ba.png)\r\n\r\nBut when I upload it to [Github pages](https://universallyleo.github.io/testapp/), the index page has no CSS applied to it:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110659061/224484932-93be9f18-23c2-4669-b8d9-994704141059.png)\r\n\r\nThe strange thing is that CSS get applies correctly on other pages, only the index page (i.e. from ` src/+page.svelte`) has this problem.  Even stranger is if I click a link to go to another page, and then click a link coming back to the index page, the CSS will be applied!  You can see this on my [demo pages](https://universallyleo.github.io/testapp/).  Can anyone explains why this is happening?\r\n\r\nThe build produce no error of course.  It is the final result that is the problem.\r\n\r\nThere was no such problem before on my old project (built around the time when SvelteKit1.0 comes out).  But when I update my npm packages everything breaks.  So I start afresh and checked that I really doesn't show the way I expect.  If any of my steps is wrong, perhaps some clarification in the documentation will be very helpful.  Perhaps some clarification on the correct steps to how to update the svelte packages in the documentation will be helpful too.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n[Link](https://github.com/universallyleo/testapp) to the repo containing the demo. \r\n\r\nThis is how I come to it:\r\n1. `npm create svelte@latest testapp`\r\n2. `npm install`\r\n3. `npm i @sveltejs/adapter-static`\r\n4. change `svelte.config.js` as follows\r\n```\r\nimport adapter from \"@sveltejs/adapter-static\";\r\n\r\nconst dev = process.argv.includes(\"dev\");\r\n\r\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */\r\nconst config = {\r\n    kit: {\r\n        // adapter-auto only supports some environments, see https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-auto for a list.\r\n        // If your environment is not supported or you settled on a specific environment, switch out the adapter.\r\n        // See https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters for more information about adapters.\r\n        adapter: adapter({\r\n            pages: \"docs\",\r\n            assets: \"docs\",\r\n        }),\r\n        paths: {\r\n            base: dev ? \"\" : \"/testapp\",\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default config;\r\n```\r\n5. Add `export const prerender=true` to `+layout.js`\r\n6. Add `+layout.svelte` and style it (this is where the CSS are set).\r\n7. Add another page `about/+page.svelte` to demonstrate that the CSS get applies correctly on the non-index page\r\n8. Add a blank `.nojekyll` to static folder\r\n9. `npm run dev` checked it is producing the result I wanted\r\n10. `npm run build` to built to docs folder\r\n11. Upload to repo to Github and have Github Page points to docs \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110659061/224485240-b16c1097-5cf8-4102-b46c-184c0d2c8ba8.png)\r\n12.
