Describe the bug\n\nIn a simple project where theres a `+layout.server.ts` file and a `+page.svelte`, calling `invalidate()` doesn't re-trigger fetching the page data from `+layout.server.ts` again. \r\n\r\nIf an \"empty\" `+page.server.ts` file is added, then the data does get re-fetched when invalidated, including the data from `+layout.server.ts`. \r\n\r\nI was able to determine that this was a regression in sveltekit 432 (https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/6174) \n\n### Reproduction\n\nReproduction example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-voqrk9?file=src/routes/+page.svelte \r\n\r\nThe date shown in the example comes from `+layout.server.ts`. Every time invalidate button is clicked, it should show a new date, and re-fetch `__data.json`, but data is never fetched and the date doesn't update.\r\n\r\nIf a `+page.server.ts` file is added returning an empty object, then it does fetch new data when invalidated.\r\n\r\nChanging the version of sveltekit to 431 in the example above solves the issues.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n###

#6269\r\nfixes #6258 \r\nfixes #6276 \r\nfixes #6257\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, the logic for determining whether a given route uses server data (and therefore needs to hit `__data.json` on invalidation/navigation) was faulty if the only server data comes from a sibling `+layout.server.js`.\r\n\r\nThe test is a bit of a sleight-of-hand because there's already a parent `+layout.server.js`, so it was already being picked up. But I've tested this fix in a repro and it works correctly.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6275/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6275/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7261474170,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5Qh818zwAAAAGw0U16","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7261474170","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-25T17:24:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7261474325,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5Qh818zwAAAAGw0U4V","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7261474325","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"574f3b84e8db342d9c7b53284c3a1382e74398f8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/574f3b84e8db342d9c7b53284c3a1382e74398f8","created_at":"2022-08-25T17:24:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
