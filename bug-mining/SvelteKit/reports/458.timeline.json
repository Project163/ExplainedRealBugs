I have a modal I want to open on initial page load, so I have something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nonMount(() => {\r\n  pushState('', { modalOpen: true });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis initially seems to work, the modal appears on page load, but then the `+layout.svelte` load promise settles, which seems to reset the `$page.state` variable. I added some logging, and the order of events is\r\n```\r\npage mounted\r\n\r\nmodal opens\r\n\r\nlayout.load settles\r\n\r\nmodal closes\r\n```","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1891182965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jessecoleman","id":5025783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjU3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5025783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessecoleman","html_url":"https://github.com/jessecoleman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessecoleman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessecoleman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessecoleman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessecoleman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessecoleman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessecoleman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessecoleman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessecoleman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessecoleman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"PatrickG","id":196478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjQ3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/196478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG","html_url":"https://github.com/PatrickG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PatrickG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-31T10:00:42Z","updated_at":"2024-01-31T10:00:42Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11765","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11765/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11765/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11765/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/11765","id":2109720204,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c5ljO-B","number":11765,"title":"Fix:

@jessecoleman You should probably use `afterNavigate` instead of `onMount`.\r\n\r\nThanks. I think I figured out my issue, which was maybe unrelated to this bug. When calling `invalidate` on a page, the `$page.state` gets reset. I found a workaround but I still don't know if this is a bug. I came up with a minimum reproduction if you want to look into this further: https://github.com/jessecoleman/sveltekit-shallow-routing-bug-report\r\n\r\nThe crux:\r\n```<script>\r\n  import { invalidateAll, pushState } from \"$app/navigation\";\r\n  import { page } from \"$app/stores\";\r\n  import { onMount } from \"svelte\";\r\n\r\n  onMount(async () => {\r\n    await new Promise(resolve => \r\n      // some latency in network before state changes\r\n      setTimeout(() => {\r\n        pushState('', { id: 123 })\r\n        resolve(null);\r\n      }, 1000)\r\n    )\r\n    // some more latency in network before calling invalidateAll\r\n    await new Promise(resolve => \r\n      setTimeout(() => {\r\n        invalidateAll();\r\n        resolve(null);\r\n      }, 1000)\r\n    );\r\n  });\r\n\r\n</script>```\r\nAfter the second promise settles and the `layout.server` `load()` reruns, the original `$page.state` is not set.
