This was not an issue in 1.0.0-next.405.\r\n\r\nWhen client-side navigating, the app crashes and completely stops responding.\r\n\r\nThis is the error in the console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclient.js:919 Unhandled Promise Rejection: TypeError: navigation_result.state.branch.at is not a function. (In 'navigation_result.state.branch.at(-1)', 'navigation_result.state.branch.at' is undefined)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn production, the code shows up in the start.js file where the array function .at() is used.\r\n\r\nThis function is not supported in iOS 14 and only has 88% browser support according to caniuse: https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_array_at\n\n### Reproduction\n\nOpen a site running the latest version of SvelteKit in iOS14. I used Browserstack for this.\n\n### Logs\n\n```shell\nUnhandled Promise Rejection: TypeError: navigation_result.state.branch.at is not a function.
