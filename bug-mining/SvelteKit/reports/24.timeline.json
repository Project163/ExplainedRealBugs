was described as a breaking change and I wasn't lying. Didn't expect it to break _quite_ this badly though.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #4758 by skipping naive path normalization during prerendering, and relying on `server.respond` to apply normalization with knowledge of whether a route is a page or an endpoint. With that, we can handle 3xx responses normally during prerendering, but only writing redirects to disk if they're _not_ just normalizations. (I guess we could write them to disk as well? But that would be a change from previous behaviour, so I figured I'd do it this way for now.)\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpx changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4761/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":3},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4761/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1116560889","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4758#issuecomment-1116560889","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4758","id":1116560889,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5CjV35","user":{"login":"Masstronaut","id":9017393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTczOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9017393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masstronaut","html_url":"https://github.com/Masstronaut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masstronaut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masstronaut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masstronaut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masstronaut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masstronaut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masstronaut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masstronaut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masstronaut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Masstronaut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-03T20:25:14Z","updated_at":"2022-05-03T20:25:14Z","body":"`@sveltejs/kit:
