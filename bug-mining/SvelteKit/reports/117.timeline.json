Sometimes I want to have implemented endpoints with post/patch/delete or hooks and other dynamic server stuff, and use `adapter-static` for example if you want to implement website (using node resp. `adapter-node` or some server-less one), but at the same time use same source codes to generate static assets for for example electron/neutralino app, or nativescript mobile app. Then I have two adapters in config, and two build commands that build for website or app based on for example `process.env`.

If you say all three features generally should work, I will dig deeper and eventually open an issue to sort it out._ ","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1151470371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Spenhouet","id":7819068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTkwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7819068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet","html_url":"https://github.com/Spenhouet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1151531791","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4287#issuecomment-1151531791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4287","id":1151531791,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5EovsP","user":{"login":"Spenhouet","id":7819068,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTkwNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7819068?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet","html_url":"https://github.com/Spenhouet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spenhouet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-09T19:27:14Z","updated_at":"2022-06-09T20:51:18Z","body":"Okay, I can give some answers to that myself.

How to migrate\r\n\r\n## browser.hydrate / browser.router / prerender.default\r\n\r\n`hydrate` and `router` have been replaced with [`csr`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options#csr). See #6446 for more info.\r\n\r\nRemove these options from your `svelte.config.js` and export them from your root `+layout.js` or `+layout.server.js` instead:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nconst config = {\r\n\tkit: {\r\n-\t\tbrowser: { hydrate: false, router: false },\r\n-\t\tprerender: { default: true }\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// src/routes/+layout.js\r\nexport const csr = false;\r\nexport const prerender = true;\r\n```\r\n\r\n(For now, you will need a `+layout.svelte` alongside your `+layout[.server].js` — this [will be fixed soon](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5967).)\r\n\r\nYou can also set these options at lower layouts or inside pages if you want.\r\n\r\nFor other changes around `prerender` see this PR: #6392\r\n\r\n## handle: resolve(event, { ssr: ... })\r\n\r\nThe `ssr` option was removed from the `resolve` function that is passed into the `handle` hook. Set it at the appropriate `+layout.js` or `+layout.server.js` or `+page.js` or `+page.server.js`. The following example shows how to turn off SSR for all admin pages:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nexport function handle({ event, resolve }) {\r\n   return resolve(event, { \r\n-      ssr: !event.url.pathname.startsWith('/admin')\r\n   });\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// src/routes/admin/+layout.js\r\nexport const ssr = false;\r\n```\r\n\r\n# PR description\r\n\r\nCloses #6356\r\n\r\nCan't believe how little code the actual change is 😄 \r\n\r\nDuring implementing this, I realized a shortcoming of the current implementation: If `+page.js` accesses a browser global, for example\r\n```js\r\ndocument;\r\nexport function load() {}\r\n```\r\n..then this will fail on the server with an error, even if you did set `ssr` in `handle`. To change this behavior we would need to lazy-load `shared` just like we do with `component` already - should we make this change?

Describe the problem\n\nThere's a few improvements that need to happen to prerendering that, while separate, are probably best tackled in one go. The broader context for this is #6197, in which it will be possible to set `export const prerender` in a layout — e.g. the root layout — such that it will be inherited by all pages within.\r\n\r\n* Instead of being a boolean, `prerender` should be an enum so that we can distinguish between pages that _can_ be prerendered from those that _must_ be prerendered. The latter can safely be excluded from the SSR manifest, whereas presently we can only exclude prerendered pages without dynamic parameters\r\n* `+server.js` files should be able to declare their prerenderability (or otherwise) as well. `+server.js` files with `POST` etc cannot be prerendered.\r\n* https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4287\r\n\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nMust-prerender pages could be declared with\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const prerender = 'always';\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what a great name is for the current `prerender = true` (i.e. can-prerender). One suggestion was this...\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const prerender = 'maybe';\r\n```\r\n\r\n...though I would be interested in alternative suggestions. (This isn't something you'd use often — only in cases where, for example, you want to prerender your 1,000 most popular blog posts or whatever and let the long tail be SSR'd, though #661 would be a better solution in the longer term.)\r\n\r\nSince `+server.js` files are standalone — i.e. they don't have a `+layout` to inherit from — the naive approach would be to make it necessary to declare the setting for every file individually, which is a pain. Instead, I think `+server.js` files should inherit their prerenderability from the pages that request them during prerendering (i.e. if an endpoint is only fetched by a must-prerender page, it can be excluded; if it is fetched by a can-prerender page or isn't fetched at all, it must be included). If necessary, it can be made explicit with `export const prerender = value`.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6356/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7286327339,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5FdcOzzwAAAAGyTIgr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7286327339","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"863a5465179b7f163bca16bf035fcc2706e5f517","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/863a5465179b7f163bca16bf035fcc2706e5f517","created_at":"2022-08-30T10:47:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
