The behaviour is also naturally different on client-side and server-side rendering, where SSR `fetch()` does not suffer from CORS issues.\r\n\r\n- A CORS error does not return a response in `fetch()` but throws an exception. Developers relying on `response.ok` pattern to check the validity of the `fetch` result are caught off guard.\r\n- This is a tough nut to crack, because it is rooted deeply in the web browser security model.\r\n- The behaviour is unexpected because you need to work around using `try ... catch` instead of `response.ok` attribute to check the error.\r\n- Although something must \"have gone wrong before\" this occurs, the unexpected behaviour is common, because many times HTTP 404 or HTTP 500 responses lack CORS headers on them. If a developer naively checks for `response.status === 404` the check might fail in a web browser, assuming a low quality third party API. This can happen if a developer is using `fetch()` in `load()`, `get()` or similar with third-party APIs. This is especially bad, when SSR renders different pages (w/working error handling) than the client-side router.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThis issue cannot be demostrated on StackBlitz (node.new) because it is related to low-level network primitives.\r\n\r\nHere is an example one can throw in their `load()` function:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n\r\n            try {\r\n                // causes CORS error because lack of CORS headers in 404\r\n                resp = await fetch(\"https://example.com/random\");\r\n            } catch(e) {\r\n                // A web browser throws TypeError: Failed to fetch\r\n                // but happens only on client-side.\r\n                // The exception is hard to distinguish from\r\n                // any other exception, because it lacks metadata\r\n                // (class name, attributes).\r\n                console.error(\"Received\", e)\r\n                // Temporary workaround\r\n                resp = {ok: false, statusText: e.message};\r\n            }\r\n\r\n\tlet error, meta;\r\n\tif (resp.ok) {\r\n\t\tmeta = await resp.json();\r\n\t\terror = null;\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tmeta = {};\r\n\t\terror = resp.statusText;\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\nYou will see this in the web developer console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAccess to fetch at 'https://example.com/random' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever I am not sure if this information is accessible within client-side JavaScript.\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.3.1\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max\r\n    Memory: 902.50 MB / 64.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /opt/homebrew/bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.14.2/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.15 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.14.2/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.7.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.14.2/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 101.0.4951.64\r\n    Firefox: 100.0.2\r\n    Safari: 15.4\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.34 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.308 \r\n    svelte: ^3.46.0 => 3.46.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI am not sure what would be the best way to address the issue. \r\n\r\nIf this issue is not fixable on a framework level, I suggest this issue is highlighted in\r\n- tutorial\r\n- examples\r\n- documentation\r\n- etc. \r\n\r\nand developers are educated that `fetch()` may throw an exception, besides returning error responses.\r\n\r\nThere are likely to be other similar low-level network issues in a web browser that needs to be handled via catch in a `fetch()` caller.
