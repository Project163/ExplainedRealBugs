instead you have to call `preloadData`/`preloadCode` within an `on:click` call before your `goto` call\r\n  - if you want the preload call to happen on hover/tap instead, you need more handlers on top\r\n- easier a11y compliance -> instead should manually describe the role/purpose of the button (or whatever component is being used)\r\n- any automatic link scraping that you might have set up for SEO/sitemap generation/whatever else\r\n\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nAn additional `data-sveltekit-replace` option on top of the [existing options](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/link-options#data-sveltekit-preload-data).\r\n\r\nThis would turn something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button\r\n  on:click={() => goto('/my-path/123', { replaceState: true })}\r\n  on:touchstart={() => preloadData('/my-path/123')}\r\n  on:mousedown={() => preloadData('/my-path/123')}\r\n>\r\n  Go to page\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\ninto this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a href=\"/my-path/123\" data-sveltekit-replace data-sveltekit-preload-data=\"tap\">\r\n  Go to page\r\n</a>\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nUsing `goto` as described above.\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\nA related comment was made in another somewhat related issue [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/969#issuecomment-1156381881).\r\n\r\nI tried looking for other discussions on this feature and couldn't find any -
