Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [X] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [X] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`.

Describe the bug\n\nWhen navigating between a route and the same route with hash link, sometimes navigation breaks.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-ysligc\r\n\r\nWhen alternating TEST (/test) and ONE (/test#one) links, navigating to ONE (#one) stops working eventually.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me as if some of the time SvelteKit thinks it's still on /test#one after navigating to /test.\r\n\r\nYou can unstuck navigation by navigating either once more to /test or navigating to another hash (any except #one).\r\n\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\nNo errors in browser logs.\n```\n\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.0 undefined\r\n    CPU: (8)

Describe the bug\n\nI have a layout conditionnally showing a dialog depending on `$page.url.hash`.\r\nUsing `<a href=\"#dialog\">` to show it and `<a href=\"/\">`  to hide it works fine. The first time.\r\n\r\nAfter navigating to `/#dialog`, followed by `/`, the next click on the `#dialog` link won't trigger a navigation and `$page.url.hash` isn't updated (unless i navigate to another

Describe the bug\n\nIf you click on a link of a #hash, and then go to a new page, and then press back to go back to that page, nothing happens.\r\n\r\nThis only seems to happen if the link includes data-sveltekit-reload. Without that, everything works fine. \r\n\r\nTaking out data-sveltekit-reload isn't a solution because there's *another* (less bad) bug: if your current path is already #hash, when you click on a link to #hash, scroll moves to the linked-to element (great) but it is not focused at all (nooo).\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-nyxdxa?file=src%2Froutes%2Fa%2F%2Bpage.svelte\r\n\r\n1. Click on link A, going to a new page.\r\n2. Click on link B, uses hash to focus on input.\r\n3. Click on link C, going to a new page.\r\n4. Press ← on browser to go back (or with side mouse button if you have that)—won't work, page stays put.\r\n\r\nNote that it doesn't matter what the hash points to, it can be anything, I just used an input because it's clearer because the input becomes focused as a clear indication the hash is working.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nI mean, it happens on Stackblitz.

Couldn't find any other issues mentioning a similar bug either.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12188/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"dolsup","id":8360934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjA5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8360934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolsup","html_url":"https://github.com/dolsup","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolsup/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolsup/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolsup/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolsup/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolsup/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolsup/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolsup/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolsup/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dolsup/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-05T10:54:55Z","updated_at":"2024-08-05T10:54:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/penxle/readable/issues/203","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/penxle/readable","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/penxle/readable/issues/203/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/penxle/readable/issues/203/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/penxle/readable/issues/203/events","html_url":"https://github.com/penxle/readable/pull/203","id":2448246719,"node_id":"PR_kwDOMX9vsM53bhuo","number":203,"title":"모달

https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/10234\r\n\r\nBy avoiding preloading pages where the URL pathname and search params (the load ID) are unchanged, we also avoid mistakenly caching navigation results for hash URLs. Currently, these are ID'd the same as URLs without hashes, causing navigation to lose track of the current URL (hence the original issue).\r\n\r\nThis should be a good solution because:\r\n1. if we're on already on the page we don't need new load results for it.\r\n2. even if the load results are suppose to be different for the same URL, clicking on a link that leads to the exact same URL already does nothing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked.
