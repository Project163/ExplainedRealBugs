Here is an example:\r\n```js\r\nimport DB from '$lib/db\r\nconst db = new DB(...)\r\nconst setup = db.connect() // returns a promise\r\n\r\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').[Handle](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/types#sveltejs-kit-handle)} */\r\nexport const handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {\r\n    await setup\r\n    event.locals.db = db\r\n    return await resolve(event)\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const cleanup = async () => {\r\n    await db.disconnect()\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nNot Applicable\n\n### Importance\n\ni cannot use SvelteKit without it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI chose the \"i cannot use SvelteKit without it\" because releasing resources is very important in any server application.","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6841/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
