This only happens to any `<a>` elements on the page with the `target=_blank` attribute.\r\n\r\nAfter some dismantling, I've tracked down the issue to [this line of CSS](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/154ee7440fe9bad408b454e5dbf77d016f882874/sites/kit.svelte.dev/src/routes/home/Features.svelte#L60) (yes, I'm also confused.).\r\nRemoving it seems to fix the problem.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly why it's causing this behaviour and why it's not reproducible anywhere else but iOS (tested on iOS 12 and 16).\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://kit.svelte.dev on an iOS device in Safari.\r\n2. Click on a website link in the showcase section at the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\niOS Version 16.1.1\r\niPhone 13 mini\r\n\r\niOS Version 12.5.5\r\niPhone 5s\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8025/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8025/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
