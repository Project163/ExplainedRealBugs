Describe the problem\n\n`adapter-static` is a source of confusion for people who believe that it allows you to _somehow_ publish an app with dynamic server rendering and/or endpoints with POST/PATCH/DELETE/etc handlers to GitHub pages.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nI haven't thought deeply about the implementation, beyond this:\r\n\r\n* If pages are left unprerendered, `adapter-static` should throw an error unless `fallback` was specified.\r\n* If an endpoint has non-GET handlers, `adapter-static` should throw an error regardless of whether `fallback` was specified.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nMore complete documentation, and spending more time dealing with issues\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No
