Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9846/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1535248083","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/9843#issuecomment-1535248083","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9843","id":1535248083,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5bggbT","user":{"login":"multiplehats","id":24393137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzkzMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24393137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/multiplehats","html_url":"https://github.com/multiplehats","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multiplehats/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multiplehats/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multiplehats/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multiplehats/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multiplehats/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multiplehats/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multiplehats/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multiplehats/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/multiplehats/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-04T18:50:19Z","updated_at":"2023-05-04T18:51:06Z","body":"I
