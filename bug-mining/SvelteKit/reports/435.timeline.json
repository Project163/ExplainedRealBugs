Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11032/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11032/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10945643636,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c52rL7EzwAAAAKMaUR0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/10945643636","actor":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-13T18:48:29Z","label":{"name":"p1-important","color":"2C3488"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10951965902,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c52rL7EzwAAAAKMybzO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/10951965902","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-14T09:31:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10951966079,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c52rL7EzwAAAAKMyb1_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/10951966079","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"aeaf164064ddffcff18132fa85f58f2a94ffaa80","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/aeaf164064ddffcff18132fa85f58f2a94ffaa80","created_at":"2023-11-14T09:31:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"austerj","id":37388465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Mzg4NDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37388465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/austerj","html_url":"https://github.com/austerj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/austerj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/austerj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/austerj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/austerj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/austerj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/austerj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/austerj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/austerj/events{/privacy}

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nI'm working on a PWA that prerenders the root page endpoint located inside an `(app)` layout group (so the service worker has access to the app shell) with a `fetch` in `(app)/+layout.ts` (which is NOT prerendered) that authenticates the user and redirects to a sign-in page at run-time.\r\n\r\nThis somewhat hacky setup was producing the desired behavior until version 1.27.4 - namely a prerendered `index.html` app shell that attempts authentication (along with fetching various cacheable assets) only at run-time and makes related data from the parent `(app)` layout load function accessible to subsequent load functions inside the group.\r\n\r\nAfter version 1.27.4, the build process errors out because it now seems to attempt to authenticate (and redirect) at build time:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode:internal/event_target:1033\r\n  process.nextTick(() => { throw err; });\r\n                           ^\r\nError: 404 /api/validate (fetched from /)\r\nTo suppress or handle this error, implement `handleHttpError` in https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#prerender\r\n```\r\n\r\nReviewing the build output, the `index.html` is now referencing the sign-in page redirected to on failed auth attempts. If I explicitly add `export const prerender = false` to this endpoint, the error instead becomes\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: /api/(auth)/validate is not prerenderable\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe errors looks similar to https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/11031 and likewise seems related to the changes introduced [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/10988) - the issue started in version 1.27.4 and downgrading to 1.27.3 fixes it. It still persists in version 1.27.6 after related issues with fully-static sites seems to have been closed.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUnfortunately a simple reproduction is not feasible due to the dependencies on auth etc.; hopefully the info provided + related issues are enough for a start. If I manage to narrow things down to where a reproduction is feasible I'll post an update.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n  OS: Linux 6.2 Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS 22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)\r\n  CPU: (32) x64 AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor\r\n  Memory: 14.34 GB / 62.71 GB\r\n  Container: Yes\r\n  Shell: 5.1.16 - /bin/bash\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 18.18.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v18.18.0/bin/node\r\n  npm: 9.8.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v18.18.0/bin/npm\r\n  pnpm: 8.9.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v18.18.0/bin/pnpm\r\nnpmPackages:\r\n  @sveltejs/adapter-vercel: ^3.0.3 => 3.0.3 \r\n  @sveltejs/kit: ^1.27.6 => 1.27.6 \r\n  svelte: ^4.2.3 => 4.2.3 \r\n  vite: ^4.5.0 => 4.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nblocking an upgrade\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11083/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11083/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
