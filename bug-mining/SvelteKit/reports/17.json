The most brute-force method would be to just hard-code the allowance of `__tests__` directories.\r\n\r\nEdit [line 28](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/src/core/sync/create_manifest_data/index.js#L28) to be:\r\n\r\n`const specials = new Set(['__layout', '__layout.reset', '__error', '__tests__']);`\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nStructuring my code like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/index.svelte\r\nsrc/index.test.svelte\r\n```\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/index.svelte\r\nsrc/_tests_/index.svelte\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe former gets very cluttered, and the latter just doesn't match the conventions used by my team on other projects so will be another tiny little speed-bump in adoption.\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI'm happy to submit a PR, but didn't want to bother if it was just going to be closed.","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4435/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
