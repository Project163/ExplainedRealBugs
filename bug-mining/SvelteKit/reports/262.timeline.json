I'm aware of the `$env` namespace, but I don't currently have the time to migrate over - we're up against the wire trying to upgrade to the RC of SvelteKit and just 'make things work'. The single workaround above (disabling our hooks when `building` is `true`) works for the time being, and I'll reference this ticket to see if anything more elegant appears in the codebase in future.\r\n\r\nI want to reiterate my thanks to you both (@Rich-Harris and @dummdidumm) and the wider team.

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time.

We still have a lot of legacy code in our app that uses Angular 1 (aka AngularJS), and just importing `angular` uses `window`. We're using adapter-static and `entries: []` to disable prerendering as much as possible.\r\n\r\nUntil version 573, this worked fine since the prerendering code was surrounded with try/catch which would basically ignore any errors. But at https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/7878/files#diff-640bb06029f8b528408cb17e6b0a88cd9d68924246d520db4a616a8a2fe7d4f9L384 this try/catch was removed, and so our app no longer builds.\r\n\r\nI confirmed that editing the file to add back that try/catch does allow the app to build, but of course that's not a proper solution since in the \"normal\" case you do want to throw those errors.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a rather different cause from OP's problem, since we're not doing anything with hooks -- it's the pages themselves and their dependencies that import `angular`. But I believe that a way to totally disable prerendering would also fix this issue.

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8013/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8013/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1343813859","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7899#issuecomment-1343813859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7899","id":1343813859,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5QGPjj","user":{"login":"dimfeld","id":1369558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjk1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1369558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/dimfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-09T03:58:55Z","updated_at":"2022-12-09T04:00:37Z","body":"We're running a \"SPA-mode\" setup. Prerendering disabled as much as we can with `prerender.entries = []`, a fallback page to run the app, nginx set up to set the fallback page in the normal way for such things, and whatever else is necessary to make that work. I think the `angular` import errors were still there before; they just didn't matter because the try/catch statement was swallowing them.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think the details are moot for now, since I just confirmed that it does work to deep-import the specific files that we need so that `angular` doesn't get imported from the `.js` files. I think I'm good now.  Thanks!\r\n\r\nIt's been a long process getting Angular slowly stripped out of our 8-year-old app, can't wait to get it finished and be 100% on SvelteKit
