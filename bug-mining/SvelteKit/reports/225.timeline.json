Describe the bug\n\nIn src/service-worker.ts I have the sole line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { relayPool } from 'nostr-tools'\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut the bundle (build/service-worker.js) contains:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default Fl();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same happens if I `import nostr from 'nostr-tools'` (or probably anything other nostr-tools.\r\n\r\nMy bundle is free of exports when importing `Dexie from 'dexie'` or a bunch of other imports.\r\n\r\nI tried to figure out in the vite discord if this \"transient\" export might be a feature of sorts but I'm more and more convinced it is a bug in the bundler.\r\n\r\nThis bug was originally reported [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6654).\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/Giszmo/tmpForBugReport is a blank
