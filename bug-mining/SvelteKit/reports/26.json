Probably something to do with SPA?\n\n### Logs\n\n```shell\nTypeError: 'text/html' is not a valid JavaScript MIME type.\r\nFailed to fetch dynamically imported module: https://<our_page.com>/_app/pages/index.svelte-91a57275.js\n```\n\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.0.1\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8259U CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 31.21 MB / 8.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 14.17.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v14.17.2/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.17 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 7.23.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v14.17.2/bin/npm\r\n    Watchman: 2022.01.03.00 - /usr/local/bin/watchman\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 98.1.35.101\r\n    Chrome: 98.0.4758.102\r\n    Firefox: 97.0\r\n    Safari: 15.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-static: ^1.0.0-next.28 => 1.0.0-next.28\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.0.0-next.266 => 1.0.0-next.266\r\n    svelte: ^3.45.0 => 3.45.0\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3978/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
