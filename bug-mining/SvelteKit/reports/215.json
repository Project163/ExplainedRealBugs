Start up a SvelteKit project.\r\n2. Visit a route that does not exist (404 error).\r\n3. You should see the dev server crash.\r\n\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.15 Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11370H @ 3.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 699.55 MB / 7.65 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.8 - /usr/bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.16.0 - ~/.volta/tools/image/node/16.16.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.17 - ~/.volta/tools/image/yarn/1.22.17/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.18.0 - ~/.volta/tools/image/npm/8.18.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 107.0.5304.68\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: 1.0.0-next.100 => 1.0.0-next.100 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.0.0-next.532 => 1.0.0-next.532 \r\n    svelte: ^3.52.0 => 3.52.0 \r\n    vite: ^3.2.2 => 3.2.2\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7560/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
