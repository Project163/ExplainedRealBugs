It is build in a container to be run in a container. Todays `npm update` killed my build process because `npm run build` started to _execute_ my source code.\r\n\r\nSo far this would build, but with `SvelteKit v1.0.0-next.304` (and its dependencies) build started to fail:\r\n```\r\n// hooks.ts\r\nexport const handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {\r\n\t// simulate crash because DB can not be connected \r\n        // without credentials and access during build process\r\n\tconsole.log('Going to simulate crash')\r\n\tprocess.exit();\r\n\r\n\tconst response = await resolve(event);\r\n\treturn response;\r\n};\r\n```\r\nMy last _good_ `npm update` was 3 days ago.\r\n\r\nNote: The build process always worked, but I had to use `npm ci --production --ignore-scripts` later with the built code.\r\n\r\nThis may have to do with the [pre-rendering](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#prerender), but I have not touched those settings.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-9crzvj?file=src%2Fhooks.js\r\n```\r\nconst config = {\r\n\tkit: {\r\n\t\tprerender: {\r\n\t\t\tenabled: false\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `npm run build` and it will execute the code and exit the process\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nWORKS\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.2.1\r\n    CPU: (8) arm64 Apple M1\r\n    Memory: 105.05 MB / 16.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 14.19.0 - /opt/homebrew/opt/node@14/bin/node\r\n    npm: 6.14.16 - /opt/homebrew/opt/node@14/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 100.0.4896.60\r\n    Firefox: 98.0.2\r\n    Safari: 15.3\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^1.0.0-next.33 => 1.0.0-next.33\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: ^1.0.0-next.73 => 1.0.0-next.73\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.0.0-next.303 => 1.0.0-next.303\r\n    svelte: ^3.46.0 => 3.46.4\r\n\r\nWORKS NOT ANYMORE\r\n\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^1.0.0-next.34 => 1.0.0-next.34\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: ^1.0.0-next.73 => 1.0.0-next.73\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.0.0-next.304 => 1.0.0-next.304\r\n    svelte: ^3.46.6 => 3.46.6\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nblocking an upgrade\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4492/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4492/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
