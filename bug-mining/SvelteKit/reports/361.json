With the cloudflare adapter I can use `platform.context.waitUntil(sendTraceData)` to keep the process alive until the trace data is sent. \n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nHave the FetchEvent (waitUntil) exposed in vercel adapter (in edge mode) to match capabilities of cloudflare adapters.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- block the user response\r\n- fetch and hope the runtime doesn't exit prematurely\r\n- use cloudflare instead\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\nVercel Build Output API (V3) has a link to an example function with an event argument. So I'm guessing it should be possible for svelte kit to expose it. Also Nextjs has it I think\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vercel/examples/blob/f52a98fb2065e2ee75ae9cc59c9c2d3a612e6c07/build-output-api/edge-functions/.vercel/output/functions/index.func/index.js#L1","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8706/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8706/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
