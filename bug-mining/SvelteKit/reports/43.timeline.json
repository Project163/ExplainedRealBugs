#4968. It's impossible to know from outside the `server` whether something is a valid route or not, so we have to move the special `favicon.ico` handling (which prevents unwanted logging) out of the `dev` task and into the server.\r\n\r\nmaybe we should do the same thing for `/service-worker.js` (since that's another file that browsers like to request a lot)\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5046/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6667948042,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5J2AxGzwAAAAGNcNAK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6667948042","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-24T10:43:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6667948323,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5J2AxGzwAAAAGNcNEj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6667948323","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"21ee69419bff94be5ac7ad219a87bd1a533a3e22","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/21ee69419bff94be5ac7ad219a87bd1a533a3e22","created_at":"2022-05-24T10:44:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dominikg","id":611613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMTYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/611613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg","html_url":"https://github.com/dominikg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-02T12:18:18Z","updated_at":"2022-06-02T12:18:18Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5136","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5136/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5136/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5136/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5136","id":1256369107,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c5K4qvT","number":5136,"title":"Endpoints

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nNot 100% sure if i'm doing something wrong but i expect this to be a bug since i can only reproduce it in Chrome and not on any other browser (didn't try Edge).\r\n\r\n**What is going wrong?**\r\nWhile navigating through my project and loading some pages i see endpoints being called that shouldn't be called. This only happens in Chrome and doesn't happen in Firefox or Safari. Easiest way to explain it is via a screen recording that can be found here, https://share.cleanshot.com/CT23BF8lyeiQ1gIJeu7L\r\n\r\nI added a console.log in each endpoint that is called when the endpoint is triggered, while clicking through the site with Chrome you will notice that multiple console.logs are logged to the terminal after a click while clicking through the exact same website with Firefox only 1 console.log is logged to the console.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe exact same code as used in the video can be found here, https://github.com/ReindDooyeweerd/sveltekit-bug\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.4\r\n    CPU: (16) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9980HK CPU @ 2.40GHz\r\n    Memory: 984.67 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.15.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.15.0/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.5.5 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.15.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 102.0.5005.61\r\n    Chrome Canary: 104.0.5096.0\r\n    Edge: 102.0.1245.30\r\n    Firefox: 100.0.1\r\n    Safari: 15.5\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5136/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
