The expected behaviour would to show the `+error.svelte` page when navigating to an unknown route. The expected behaviour works with on a local environment and StackBlitz, but doesn't work when deployed to Vercel.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nMain difference between the default SvelteKit template and this code is the use of `adapter-vercel`.\n\nRepository: https://github.com/David-Hobson/sveltejs-kit-template-default-nfrbl1xj \nStackBlitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-nfrbl1xj\nVercel Deployment: https://sveltejs-kit-template-default-git-2e6258-david-hobsons-projects.vercel.app/\n\nSteps to Reproduce on Vercel: \n\n1. Navigate to https://sveltejs-kit-template-default-git-2e6258-david-hobsons-projects.vercel.app/ and see that a regular SvelteKit application is running in Vercel\n2. Navigate to https://sveltejs-kit-template-default-git-2e6258-david-hobsons-projects.vercel.app/foo and see a 500 error instead of the `+error.svelte`\n\nSteps to Reproduce on StackBlitz\n1. Navigate to https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-nfrbl1xj and see that a regular SvelteKit application is running in StackBlitz\n2. Within StackBlitz navigate to the `/foo` route and see that the `+error.svelte` page does render due to an unknown route.\n\nCloning the repo and running locally has the same behaviour as in StackBlitz, the issue occurs when deployed to Vercel.\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\nLogs within Vercel when navigating to `/foo`\n\nTypeError: manifest._.nodes[0] is not a function\n    at respond_with_error (file:///var/task/.svelte-kit/output/server/index.js:1885:53)\n    at resolve2 (file:///var/task/.svelte-kit/output/server/index.js:3029:22)\n    at resolve (file:///var/task/.svelte-kit/output/server/index.js:2870:34)\n    at init_promise.#options.hooks.handle (file:///var/task/.svelte-kit/output/server/index.js:3114:71)\n    at respond (file:///var/task/.svelte-kit/output/server/index.js:2868:43)\n    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:105:5)\n\n\n\nStackBlitz and Local Logs (expected behaviour)\n\n  VITE v6.2.0  ready in 2381 ms\n\n  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/\n  ➜  Network: use --host to expose\n  ➜  press h + enter to show help\n1:49:37 PM [vite] (client) ✨ new dependencies optimized: clsx\n1:49:37 PM [vite] (client) ✨ optimized dependencies changed. reloading\nSvelteKitError: Not found: /foo\n    at new SvelteKitError (/home/projects/sveltejs-kit-template-default-nfrbl1xj/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/runtime/control.js:10:3)\n    at resolve (/home/projects/sveltejs-kit-template-default-nfrbl1xj/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/runtime/server/respond.js:497:50)\n    at resolve (/home/projects/sveltejs-kit-template-default-nfrbl1xj/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/runtime/server/respond.js:308:23)\n    at Object.eval (/home/projects/sveltejs-kit-template-default-nfrbl1xj/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/runtime/server/index.js:39:34)\n    at respond (/home/projects/sveltejs-kit-template-default-nfrbl1xj/node_modules/@sveltejs/kit/src/runtime/server/respond.js:306:31) {\n  status: 404,\n  text: 'Not Found'\n```\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\n    OS: macOS 14.6\n    CPU: (12) arm64 Apple M3 Pro\n    Memory: 705.89 MB / 36.00 GB\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 22.13.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.13.1/bin/node\n    npm: 10.9.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.13.1/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 9.14.4 - ~/Library/pnpm/pnpm\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 133.0.6943.142\n    Edge: 133.0.3065.82\n    Safari: 17.6\n  npmPackages:\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^4.0.0 => 4.0.0\n    @sveltejs/adapter-vercel: ^5.6.3 => 5.6.3\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^2.16.0 => 2.17.3\n    @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte: ^5.0.0 => 5.0.3\n    svelte: ^5.0.0 => 5.20.5\n    vite: ^6.0.0 => 6.2.0\n```\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI have additionally opened an issue with Vercel to get more information as this could be an error on their end.
