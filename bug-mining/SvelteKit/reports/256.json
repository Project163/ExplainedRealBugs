I opened a PR fixing the specific definition of `ActionData`, but I noticed that, while the `form` property `packages/kit/src/runtime/server/page` is strictly `something | null`, the `form` properties in `packages/kit/src/runtime/client` are _not_, and range between `something | undefined`, `something | undefined | null`, and `something | null`. I just want to reach a consensus on what's going on here before merging my simple PR -- if the types internally are futzed up, we're going to end up accidentally introducing `undefined` as a value for `form` at some point.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-7rhsve?file=src/routes/+page.svelte\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.6\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Pro\r\n    Memory: 226.42 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.2 - ~/Library/Caches/fnm_multishells/13881_1670305350623/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.19.2 - ~/Library/Caches/fnm_multishells/13881_1670305350623/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 107.0.5304.121\r\n    Safari: 15.6.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    svelte: ^3.53.1 => 3.53.1\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7961/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7961/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
