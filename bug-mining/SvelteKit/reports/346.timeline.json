Looking at your error log, it sounds like you eagerly use `fetch` on the server inside your Svelte file, which probably is not what you want since it's not waited on until the response is rendered.\r\n\r\nThat said, the error is confusing since it's not called inside a `load` function.\r\n\r\nCould you please provide the code of your `+layout.svelte` so we can see that code that's actually causing this?

judging from the code snippet this could never have worked, you would have gotten a different error (which is generic and therefore we added a more descriptive error in #8370), but you would have gotten an error.\r\n\r\n@amr3k your case is interesting. Using `{#await ..}` like that on the server does swallow the error, which is why it worked for you before - but probably not the way you expected it. On the server, `{#await ..}` is not actually awaited, instead you fire off a request which is ignored (or in your case, previously errored because the URL is invalid).\r\n\r\nBoth of your use cases sound like you maybe are not interested in server side rendering at all? In this case you can turn your SvelteKit app into an SPA by adding `export const ssr = false` to a root `+layout.js`

thing is running `fetch` eagerly on component render (which also happens if you do `{#await fetch(..)}` in your template) doesn't have the outcome you want. On the server, it will invoke the fetch but will never use that result. Possible fixes:\r\n- put those `fetch` calls inside a `load` function instead and use `event.fetch` from `load`\r\n- guard all eager `fetch` calls with the `browser` boolean to not make them on the server\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1405129413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-26T14:59:17Z","updated_at":"2023-01-26T14:59:17Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8013","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8013/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8013/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8013/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8013","id":1485891658,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c5E28R9","number":8013,"title":"[breaking]
