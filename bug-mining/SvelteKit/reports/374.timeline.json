Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\nFor issue #4714. I couldn't find a clear example of service worker functionality being tested in the existing tests and didn't know if Playwright browser context was the right way to go about things. I did make an example project to verify this functionality is working and it can be found [here](https://github.com/sellenth/expose-paths-in-service-worker). Also my IDE warned me that service workers doesn't have an exported member 'paths'. I assumed this was something that would need to be changed in the LSP project.\r\n\r\nLots of unknowns for me.

closes #4714\r\n* closes #8472\r\n\r\nThis adds a `base` export to `$service-worker`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { base } from '$service-worker';\r\n```\r\n\r\nRather than being hardcoded from the `paths.base` in `svelte.config.js`, this is computed when the service worker boots up. This means that if the app is deployed somewhere where we don't know the base path (IPFS being the classic example), it will continue to work.\r\n\r\nIt also modifies the existing `build`, `files` and `prerendered` exports to use `base` instead of having the hardcoded prefix.\r\n\r\nNote that there's no `assets` here, because you can't use a service worker alongside `assets` (since a service worker can only control requests for the same domain/path prefix, i.e. `https://cdn.example.com/my-app/service-worker.js` can't handle requests for your app).\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9250/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1452455143","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4714#issuecomment-1452455143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4714","id":1452455143,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5WkrTn","user":{"login":"benmccann","id":322311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/322311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/benmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-02T19:45:18Z","updated_at":"2023-03-02T19:45:18Z","body":"I'm not that familiar with service workers.
