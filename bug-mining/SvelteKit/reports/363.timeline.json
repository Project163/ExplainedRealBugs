Many people these days use it to mean something like the SvelteKit default (i.e. server-rendered pages with client-side routing), for example. For some people it implies a single `index.html` shell (your definition would require adapter-static to be installed and configured to use a fallback page, though the name of the fallback page will differ from one webserver to another), but for others it purely describes the rendering and routing approach, and doesn't preclude dynamically rendered API routes (which means you _can't_ use adapter-static).\r\n\r\nSo there's no single definition that would make sense for inclusion in the `create-svelte` template list (and we don't want the list to balloon with lots of increasingly complex options).\r\n\r\nOn top of that, while there _are_ valid reasons to build something without SSR, it's a bad default for the majority of projects, so we want there to be a _little_ bit of friction.\r\n\r\nWe could possibly add a page to the docs explaining all of the above, but I don't see us changing anything in the framework itself.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1398815687/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1398822144","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/8631#issuecomment-1398822144","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8631","id":1398822144,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5TYFUA","user":{"login":"laoshaw","id":18351761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzUxNzYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18351761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoshaw","html_url":"https://github.com/laoshaw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoshaw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoshaw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoshaw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoshaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoshaw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoshaw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoshaw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoshaw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laoshaw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-20T19:12:11Z","updated_at":"2023-01-20T19:12:11Z","body":"> Ah, the \"SvelteKit demo app\" is not a good choice if you want a SPA.

not indicate/still builds ssr bundle when SSR is disabled globally during build - it still builds and shows \"building SSR bundle for production\" even though generated files from this step are not even used with static

Svelte's historical success with single-page, rich, interactive experiences for data visualization were what originally attracted me to it.
