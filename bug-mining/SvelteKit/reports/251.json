But unfortunately, our error mapper is an asynchronous function. Since it is not possible in JavaScript to synchronously await an asynchronous function (like in C#), it seems we cannot use the handleError hook currently.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nMake the return type of `HandleServerError` and `HandleClientError` a `MaybePromise`, like the handle-hook.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface HandleServerError {\r\n  (input: { error: unknown; event: RequestEvent }): MaybePromise<void | App.Error>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport interface HandleClientError {\r\n  (input: { error: unknown; event: NavigationEvent }): MaybePromise<void | App.Error>;\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nContinue not to use `handleError`.\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7756/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
