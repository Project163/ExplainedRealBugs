And then we could have a counterpart, `afterBeforeNavigate` (mostly kidding)\r\n\r\nBut yes, this would be super helpful for integrating with shared element transitions. [My demo](https://github.com/geoffrich/sveltekit-shared-element-transitions/blob/7de6f37bd07f9dd69af2e0bb59e4285f879d2143/src/lib/page-transition.js#L43-L60) currently starts the transition in `beforeNavigate`, which has the downside of waiting for a network call to complete the transition. It would be better to start the transition after the network call but before the DOM is updated so the page can still be interactive while the network call happens -- once you call `transition.start`, the page is basically a static screenshot.\r\n\r\nFrom [the explainer](https://github.com/WICG/shared-element-transitions/blob/main/developer-guide.md#async-dom-updates): \r\n\r\n> The API supports asynchronous DOM updates, which are common in most frameworks. To make this work, callback should return a promise that resolves once the DOM update is complete. However, remember that the user is left with a non-interactive screenshot between callback being called and its promise resolving, so this should happen as fast as possible. Specifically, avoid things like network activity – do those before creating the transition, like this:\r\n\r\nAs for bikeshedding: if we're going after your previous comment, perhaps `beforeNavigateCommit`?

#5689. This adds an `onNavigate` lifecycle function.\r\n\r\nPresently, there are two navigation lifecycle functions — `beforeNavigate` and `afterNavigate`. `beforeNavigate` fires before any navigation, and gives you the ability to (for example) cancel it, while `afterNavigate` fires once the page has been updated following a navigation (or initial hydration).\r\n\r\nBetween them, most use cases are covered, but there is one major missing piece: between `beforeNavigate` and `afterNavigate` callbacks running, we need to load the code and data for the new route, and that can take a noticeable amount of time. Because of that, we can't use these functions to do some work _immediately_ before a navigation takes effect.\r\n\r\n> Aside: @oodavid has collected some cases where `beforeNavigate` is insufficient, and this will require some design work in the near future. This PR shouldn't conflict with that work.\r\n\r\nWith [View Transitions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/), this is a problem. When you call `document.startViewTransition(callback)`, it takes a screenshot of the current page, and the page is frozen until the promise returned from `callback` resolves. This user experience is untenable.\r\n\r\n`onNavigate` addresses this problem. Callbacks are called immediately before a navigation is applied; if they return functions, those functions are called once the DOM has updated.\r\n\r\nBecause the view transition callback isn't called synchronously, we in fact need to delay DOM updates until the screenshot has been taken. For that reason, `onNavigate` callbacks can return a promise that will delay the navigation from taking effect. **This is a footgun — you could return a promise that resolves slowly or even fails to resolve, breaking your app** — but in practice I don't expect this to be a problem as long as it's well-documented (and we could add dev-time checks to ensure that promises resolve quickly).\r\n\r\nHere's an example — note the sliding nav indicator:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1162160/230094152-64e3a4cc-d808-4d20-918a-b92819955485.mov\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was done by adding the following code to the root layout...\r\n\r\n```js\r\nonNavigate(() => {\r\n  if (!document.startViewTransition) return;\r\n\r\n  return new Promise((fulfil) => {\r\n    document.startViewTransition(() => new Promise(fulfil));\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and the following CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root {\r\n  /* disable document-level crossfade */\r\n  view-transition-name: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\nli[aria-current='page']::before {\r\n  view-transition-name: indicator; /* this name could be anything */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to control the animation, we could do so like this:\r\n\r\n```csc\r\n:root::view-transition-group(indicator) {\r\n  animation-duration: 1s;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Note that we need to add the `:root` selector before the pseudo-element, otherwise Svelte will scope it to the component. We may want to omit `::view-transition-{old,new,group}` from the CSS scoping logic in Svelte 4, so that idiomatic uses of the view transitions API are covered.)\r\n\r\nI'll admit that this code...\r\n\r\n```js\r\nreturn new Promise((fulfil) => {\r\n  document.startViewTransition(() => new Promise(fulfil));\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n...is absolutely brain-breaking. Perhaps there's a nicer way to do this that I'm not seeing, but if not then we may eventually want to add some higher level utilities around this stuff.\r\n\r\ncc @geoffrich who has been investigating the view transitions API more thoroughly than I have, and may have feedback/thoughts.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9605/reactions","total_count":69,"+1":34,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":15,"confused":1,"heart":19,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9605/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1497773725","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5689#issuecomment-1497773725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5689","id":1497773725,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5ZRjad","user":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-05T16:19:39Z","updated_at":"2023-04-05T16:19:39Z","body":"Revisiting this now that the View Transitions API (as it's now called) is in Chrome stable.
