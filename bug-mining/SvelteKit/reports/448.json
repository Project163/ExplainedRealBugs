I've searched this up a lot and couldn't find anything or what I might be doing wrong, so I assume it's a bug? I am not sure though.\r\n\r\nIt is probably fixable by manually going in and changing the paths, but that should not be required.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/mybearworld/svelte-base-path-bug-report\r\n\r\n- Make a new Svelte app with Typescript using `npm create svelte@latest svelte-base-path-bug-report`\r\n- Install dependencies with `npm i`\r\n- Install static adapter with `npm i @sveltejs/adapter-static`\r\n- Change `svelte.config.js` to the file below\r\n- Create `/src/routes/+layout.ts` as `export const prerender = true; export const ssr = false;`\r\n- Build with `npm run build`\r\n- See it fail, while working perfectly fine without config.paths\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport adapter from \"@sveltejs/adapter-static\";\r\n\r\nconst dev = process.argv.includes(\"dev\");\r\n\r\nconst config = {\r\n  kit: {\r\n    adapter: adapter({\r\n      pages: \"build\",\r\n      assets: \"build\",\r\n      fallback: undefined,\r\n      precompress: false,\r\n      strict: true,\r\n    }),\r\n    paths: {\r\n      base: dev ? \"\" : \"/svelte-base-path-bug-report\",\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default config;\r\n```\n\n### Logs\n\n```shell\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)    start.479a71cd.js:1\r\nUncaught (in promise) TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://localhost:4173/_app/immutable/entry/start.479a71cd.js    svelte-base-path-bug-report:1\r\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)   singletons.8af3bb0e.js:1\r\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)   app.71e45c29.js:1\n```\n\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.22621\r\n    CPU: (2) x64 AMD Athlon Silver 3050U with Radeon Graphics\r\n    Memory: 713.66 MB / 5.94 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.16.0 - ~\\Appdata\\Local\\NodeJs\\node.EXE\r\n    Yarn: 3.5.1 - ~\\Appdata\\Local\\NodeJs\\yarn.CMD\r\n    npm: 9.6.6 - ~\\Appdata\\Local\\NodeJs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Edge: Spartan (44.22621.1702.0), Chromium (113.0.1774.42), ChromiumDev (111.0.1660.12)\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.22621.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    svelte: ^3.54.0 => 3.59.1\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9982/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9982/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
