This is demonstrated in the video below of [kit.svelte.dev](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs), which was recorded in Firefox, although the same behaviour occurs (for me) on Chrome. The same is occurring in my own SvelteKit apps, and also in the simple reproduction linked below. Do note that is does not always occur, although I have not been able to find a pattern.\r\n\r\nIt may be related to #2733, although it is a separate problem: the page scroll position *is* always reset to top, but not quickly enough. My apologies if this has been addressed before, or if it is simply a limitation of CSR, as it's my first issue opened here. \r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33397397/221026050-d409cfd5-65ad-4a29-a19a-742055415bf1.mp4\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nNothing complicated here, just two scrollable pages.\r\nhttps://github.com/Coretteket/jagged-scroll-repro\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 11 10.0.22623\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 AMD Ryzen 7 4700U with Radeon Graphics\r\n    Memory: 1000.01 MB / 7.39 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.15.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.17 - ~\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\yarn.CMD\r\n    npm: 8.10.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Edge: Spartan (44.22621.1325.0), Chromium (110.0.1587.46), ChromiumDev (111.0.1660.13)\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.22621.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-vercel: ^2.1.0 => 2.1.0\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.8.3 => 1.8.3\r\n    svelte: ^3.55.1 => 3.55.1\r\n    vite: ^4.1.4 => 4.1.4\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9189/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
