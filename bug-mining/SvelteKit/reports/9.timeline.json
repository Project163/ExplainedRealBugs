#3715 \r\n\r\nWhen a shadow endpoint throws an error (or returns a status code > 400, with an `error` property in the body), it is useful for the `__error.svelte` handler to have access to that error message. This could be obfuscated in non-dev environments, if that's what the maintainers would advise.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we'd find a way to transfer the full error object. This is super useful in local development - in the past I've used https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialize-error to serialize/deserialize the whole error object over JSON so that the `__error.svelte` handler can print the stack trace.\r\n\r\nNB: I haven't written a new test yet, but will do so if this approach is acceptable. \r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpx changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4032/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4032/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6115073171,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5CsnKOzwAAAAFsfJyT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6115073171","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e4d66f06200df9e86badacf3f6601bcb957c321a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/e4d66f06200df9e86badacf3f6601bcb957c321a","created_at":"2022-02-22T03:29:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-22T03:31:12Z","updated_at":"2022-02-22T03:31:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4041","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4041/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4041/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4041/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4041","id":1146413793,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c4zQpM6","number":4041,"title":"prevent

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpx changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit

Describe the bug\n\nWhen running a SvelteLab project in the workspace editor and preview pane, everything runs smoothly. When opening the preview pane in a new tab, Vite throws an error:\r\n\r\n> Error: `line` must be greater than 0 (lines start at line 1)\r\n>   at originalPositionFor$1 (/home/httpswwwsveltelabdev dcnb/node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-df561101.js:10179:19)\r\n\r\nThe only similar issue I could find is here: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3638\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Go to https://www.sveltelab.dev/m9sq9hiyjbk1okq\r\n2. After Vite starts, open preview window in a new tab\r\n3. Observe error\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt should continue to run normally without breaking.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"667\" alt=\"image\"

seems to work well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SvelteLab/SvelteLab/issues/275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SvelteLab/SvelteLab/issues/275/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"kuatroka","id":9093546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwOTM1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9093546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuatroka","html_url":"https://github.com/kuatroka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuatroka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuatroka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuatroka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuatroka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuatroka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuatroka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuatroka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuatroka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kuatroka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-22T22:55:14Z","updated_at":"2023-12-22T22:55:14Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11451","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11451/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11451/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11451/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/11451","id":2054562487,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c56diK3","number":11451,"title":"`line`
