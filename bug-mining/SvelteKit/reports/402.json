This script only defines one CLI arg, `sync`, so it's impossible to actually run the sandbox project.\r\n\r\n#### Building\r\n\r\nAlso from the contribution guide:\r\n\r\n> You must rebuild each time before running the tests if you've made code changes.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm missing something but it's seems unclear how to build the project, as there's is no pnpm build command of any sort. Is the project supposed to be built to a `.dist` folder?\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\n- Update the [sandbox example](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit-sandbox) so it works. \r\n- Provide a command for building the project so tests can run on changed code.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThere are some bugs in Sveltekit I'm trying to fix since they relate to my specific project.","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9800/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
