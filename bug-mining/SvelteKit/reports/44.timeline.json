Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5045/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6670037206,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5KKpoPzwAAAAGNkLDW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6670037206","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-24T15:13:55Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6670037446,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5KKpoPzwAAAAGNkLHG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6670037446","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9b13c61c68ac4fe601e0a95cf958f7b63fa7a754","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/9b13c61c68ac4fe601e0a95cf958f7b63fa7a754","created_at":"2022-05-24T15:13:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"BTMuli","id":72692909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNjkyOTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72692909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BTMuli","html_url":"https://github.com/BTMuli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BTMuli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BTMuli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BTMuli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BTMuli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BTMuli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BTMuli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BTMuli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BTMuli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BTMuli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-25T03:05:22Z","updated_at":"2024-10-25T03:05:22Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/20453","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/20453/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/20453/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/echarts/issues/20453/events","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/echarts/pull/20453","id":2612952608,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAIwqAM5_2EWX","number":20453,"title":"Add
