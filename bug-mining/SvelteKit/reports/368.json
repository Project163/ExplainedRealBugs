Did you mean to set its 'path' to '/' instead?\r\n\r\nIt doesn't happen every time, but it happens often. The `fail-type` cookie is set here...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/9c626a9da8db1627a4de4f68247816ef7ffa7b4c/packages/kit/test/apps/basics/src/routes/errors/error-html/make-root-fail/%2Bserver.js#L4-L7\r\n\r\n...so that it can be read here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/9c626a9da8db1627a4de4f68247816ef7ffa7b4c/packages/kit/test/apps/basics/src/routes/%2Blayout.server.js#L15-L18\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the `path` _is_ set, so it's unclear why this message appears.
