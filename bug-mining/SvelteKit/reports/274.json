In these cases, there's no obvious reason not to prerender the shell page.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nIf a page is rendered with `ssr: false`, don't bail out during prerendering here, unless `export const prerender` is explicitly `false` (to provide an escape hatch when the app is doing something funky in `handle`): https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/b5cf676d30515b2168238064169d754276a7d5bc/packages/kit/src/runtime/server/page/respond.js#L70-L76\r\n\r\n\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe alternative is to continue dynamically server-rendering empty pages.
