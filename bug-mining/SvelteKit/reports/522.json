The `https://example.com/.netlify/identity` path gets a 404 from SvelteKit, but it should be handled by Netlify (or at least I think so).\r\n\r\nUsing the adapter without the Edge Functions enabled doesn't break Netlify Identity.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n[Stackblitz fork](https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-yn2ycz?file=svelte.config.js).\r\n\r\n1. Create a project on Netlify.\r\n2. Enable [Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/) and [Git Gateway](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/git-gateway/).\r\n3. Try to login at /admin (or invite yourself and try to accept the invite)\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nThe Firefox browser console shows `[XHR] GET https://example.com/.netlify/identity/settings [HTTP/2 404 Not Found 31ms]`\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n  OS: macOS 12.4\r\n  CPU: (8) arm64 Apple M1\r\n  Memory: 81.97 MB / 16.00 GB\r\n  Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\nBinaries:\r\n  Node: 16.14.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.14.0/bin/node\r\n  Yarn: 1.22.15 - /opt/homebrew/bin/yarn\r\n  npm: 8.5.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.14.0/bin/npm\r\nBrowsers:\r\n  Chrome: 102.0.5005.115\r\n  Firefox: 101.0.1\r\n  Safari: 15.5\r\n  Safari Technology Preview: 15.4\r\nnpmPackages:\r\n  @sveltejs/adapter-netlify: next => 1.0.0-next.64 \r\n  @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.350 \r\n  svelte: ^3.48.0 => 3.48.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5235/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
