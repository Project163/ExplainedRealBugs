Describe the problem\r\n\r\nThe convenient function `redirect` is really useful to redirect users to another page. It can be used in a lot of different files files, except for the `hooks` file.\r\n\r\nIt is not that unlikely to have a logic inside the `handle` function that checks if the user is authorized and then redirect the user to the login page.\r\n\r\nIn order to do so someone can't throw a `redirect` as everything thrown inside `handle` will result in an 500 error. In order to redirect a proper `Response` object needs to be returned.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nif (!authorized) {\r\n\treturn new Response(null, { status: 302, headers: { Location: '/login' } })\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWriting it like this involves writing a bit of an overhead, but I would really love to use the `redirect` helper function like I do in all other code parts.\r\n\r\nI'm currently using a wrapper to handle this use case where `handleRequest` is the actual implementation of my `handle` functionality:\r\n```ts\r\nexport const handle: Handle = async (input) => handleRequest(input)\r\n\t.catch(error => {\r\n\t\t// can't use instanceof `Redirect` because class get's not exported\r\n\t\tif (error.status && error.location) {\r\n\t\t\treturn new Response(null, {\r\n\t\t\t\tstatus: error.status,\r\n\t\t\t\theaders: { location: error.location }\r\n\t\t\t})\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t// can't use instanceof `HttpError` because class get's not exported\r\n\t\tif (error.status && error.body) {\r\n\t\t\treturn new Response(JSON.stringify(error.body), { status: error.status })\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\treturn new Response(null, { status: 500 })\r\n\t})\r\n```\r\nHere I'm catching `Redirect`s and `HttpError`s and implementing and returning custom `Response`s. But this has a few weak points:\r\n - user code does not have access to `Redirect`, so I have to check it in another way\r\n - when SvelteKit changes the implementation of the `Redirect` class, my code will no longer work\r\n - possible inconsistencies with framework code (I did not take a look what exactly happens when SvelteKit handles `Redirect objects)\r\n - does not handle setting cookies (related to #7611)\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an official solution to this problem.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\n`SvelteKit` should catch errors from the `handle` function and redirect the user if a `Redirect` class gets thrown.\r\n\r\nA similar thing could be done for the `HttpError` class thrown by the `error()` helper function. I guess that is related to this issue: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7272.\r\nAt least SvelteKit could set the correct status code when someone uses the `error` convenient function to throw inside `handle`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nLeave it to users to\r\n1. discover that this functionality it is not supported\r\n2. figure out a way to make redirects happen\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No

Describe the problem\n\nWhen doing a client-side `__data.json` request, errors thrown with the `error` helper function inside `hooks.server.ts` , will not return the correct error object.\r\n\r\nIt works as expected when `error` gets thrown inside a `+server.*` file.\r\n\r\nHere is a demonstration of the issue; https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-djcepj?file=src/hooks.server.ts\r\n\r\n1. start the application\r\n2. click on the \"test hooks.server.ts\" link\r\n3. a 401 error gets thrown inside `hooks.servert.ts`\r\n4. the page shows a 500 error\r\n5. reload the page\r\n6. the 401 error gets correctly shown\r\n\r\nrelated: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7609\r\nThe issue was already described as a sidenote there.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\n`SvelteKit` should support throwing `error` objects also for `__data.json` requests inside `hooks.server.ts`.\r\nThis makes the usage of the `error` helper function more consistent.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nLeave it as it is\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No
