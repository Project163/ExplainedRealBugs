(Basically, insert another URL change between steps 6 and 7, or between steps 7 and 8, and the behavior will probably change).\r\n\r\nI haven't kept up with Svelte-Kit internals recently, so I'm not current on how the URL hash is being handled w/r/t navigations and whether there are plans to change that in the near future. In the meantime, it might be possible to work around this by using something other than the hash to keep track of a modal being opened or not.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1195060614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rmunn","id":90762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn","html_url":"https://github.com/rmunn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmunn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7062731990,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c5ObxHXzwAAAAGk-LzW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7062731990","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-26T08:24:19Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7062731992,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c5ObxHXzwAAAAGk-LzY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7062731992","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-26T08:24:19Z","label":{"name":"router","color":"0052cc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7331279422,"node_id":"MIE_lADOEiPr8c5ObxHXzwAAAAG0-nI-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7331279422","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-06T14:54:32Z","milestone":{"title":"1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7384622474,"node
