https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/12582\r\nfixes https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/12188\r\n\r\n~~Replaces https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/10032 by using `location.replace` to allow the browser to handle hash link behaviour instead https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/10856#issuecomment-2125471544~~\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that clicking on a hash link with the reload option avoids the usual behaviour of thinking the page will reload and instead allows it to be handled as if the option wasn't enabled (hash links on the same page never reload the page).\r\n\r\nIt also fixes a behaviour where an element doesn't get focused when clicking on the hash link more than once.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] fix behaviour where clicking a hash link twice doesn't focus the input\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12866/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12866/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14953170274,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c6TTWS9zwAAAAN7R0Vi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/14953170274","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-28T09:33:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14953170315,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c6TTWS9zwAAAAN7R0WL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/14953170315","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5006435ef30b4057a43e4e143e3422879035629d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/5006435ef30b4057a43e4e143e3422879035629d","created_at":"2024-10-28T09:33:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
