started out with me working on #4051 and immediately wanting to move `packages/kit/src/hooks.js` to `packages/kit/src/hooks/sequence.js` so that we could have a `sequence.spec.js` alongside it, but not wanting to do that because it would make `src` even more raggedy than it currently is.\r\n\r\nAs of this PR, the contents of `src` look like this...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsrc/\r\n├ core/     # the dev/build logic\r\n├ exports/  # stuff exposed as the `@sveltejs/kit` package\r\n├ runtime/  # code that runs when people use a SvelteKit app\r\n├ utils/    # self-explanatory\r\n└ cli.js    # self-explanatory\r\n```\r\n\r\n...which I think makes more sense than `src/vite`, `src/node` etc. There's definitely more that could be done here (the `runtime` directory in particular has become a bit chaotic), but sorting out the top level feels like a good start, and would make me feel calmer when I'm working in the codebase.\r\n\r\nNo changeset because this change should be invisible to users. I used `git mv` to preserve history and minimise the chance of merge conflicts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7282664874,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5EXZxCzwAAAAGyFKWq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7282664874","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7938a3af6eee0052a9e8aeb1c73ae367e2bd759f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/7938a3af6eee0052a9e8aeb1c73ae367e2bd759f","created_at":"2022-08-29T22:54:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-29T22:58:21Z","updated_at":"2022-08-29T22:58:21Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6401","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6401/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6401/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6401/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/6401","id":1354958670,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c4-AVx-","number":6401,"title":"merge
