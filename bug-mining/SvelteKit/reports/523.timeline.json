into this. Turning in `declarationMap` in the `tsconfig.json` is enough to create the `d.ts.map` files, so I don't think we need an extra option here. The URL inside that mapping file is problematic though:\r\n- For Svelte files, it points to a `.svelte.ts` file, but that should be a `.svelte.ts` file. The relative path also goes up one directory too far (should be `../src/` instead of `../../src/`)\r\n- In general, it's a relative path pointing to the source, which isn't available if you only publish the contents of `package`\r\n\r\nThe first one is a proper bug on our side which needs fixing. The second one is a general TypeScript problem, that behavior is not configurable (there's an [open issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/38966) on the TS tracker for it). The question is if we somehow smooth over it by copying over the sources, too, if we detect that the user wants this, or if it's in the hands of the developer to do the right thing there (not publishing the `package` directory, rather the whole project and configure the main `package.json` manually correctly).\r\nI'm leaning towards first fixing the bug on our side and document the behavior.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1410532379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8414802289,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5XL1QizwAAAAH1j7Fx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8414802289","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c8a07949789f11fb0cbf0a784a0455ea68a955a4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/c8a07949789f11fb0cbf0a784a0455ea68a955a4","created_at":"2023-02-01T21:27:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-01T21:28:07Z","updated_at":"2023-02-01T21:28:07Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8843","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8843/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8843/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8843/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/8843","id":1566859417,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c5JDCZf","number":8843,"title":"fix:
