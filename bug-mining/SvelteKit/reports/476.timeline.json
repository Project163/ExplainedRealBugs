[Second-guessing the modern web](https://macwright.com/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html), Tom MacWright makes several good points (I responded [here](https://dev.to/richharris/in-defense-of-the-modern-web-2nia)).\r\n\r\nThe biggest, to me, is this one:\r\n\r\n> User sessions are surprisingly long: someone might have your website open in a tab for weeks at a time. I’ve seen it happen. So if they open the ‘about page’, keep the tab open for a week, and then request the ‘home page’, then the home page that they request is dictated by *the index bundle that they downloaded last week*. This is a deeply weird and under-discussed situation.\r\n\r\nI wrote:\r\n\r\n> It's an excellent point that isn't really being addressed, though (as Tom acknowledges) it's really just exacerbating a problem that was always there. I think there are solutions to it — we can iterate on the 'index bundle' approach, we could include the site version in a cookie and use that to show actionable feedback if there's a mismatch — but we do need to spend time on it.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if there was some mechanism for solving (or at least alleviating) this problem. I think the 'include the site version in a cookie' approach is the most promising, but I haven't thought through any of the details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/87/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":3},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/87/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"jycouet","id":5312607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTI2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5312607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jycouet","html_url":"https://github.com/jycouet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jycouet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jycouet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jycouet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jycouet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jycouet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jycouet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jycouet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jycouet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jycouet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-15T14:31:29Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T14:31:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3957","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3957/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3957/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3957/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3957","id":1140469704,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c5D-i_I","number":3957,"title":"If

Describe the problem\n\nSometimes the changes in the new version are so minor that updating the page and all the resources to apply them is very inefficient.\r\nI suggest creating a dynamic update feature similar to hot reload.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nThe idea is very crude.\r\n\r\nI suggest:\r\n- `plan_dynamic_update` - a function that will schedule `dynamic_update` to run on navigation\r\n- `dynamic_update` - a function that triggers a dynamic update\r\n\r\nDynamic update: \r\n1. a certain manifest is updated\r\n2. it is compared with the current version manifest\r\n3. only the modified parts of the application are updated\r\n    - static assets are being reloaded\r\n    - sw is being updated (https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3667)\r\n    - server side and endpoints with `load` dependencies are updated, live connections are not interrupted\r\n    - components are being updated, other components are not affected and their state does not change\r\n      - for example, the page component has changed, it is being reloaded, but the layout component is not affected, as if normal navigation had occurred\r\n      - for example, a component has changed in the depth of the page, and if the component is usually imported and treated as a constant, now it becomes a reactive variable and restarts the dependent code when updating\r\n\r\nIt seems like it's going to be difficult or impossible.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional

patch adds a function that tries to update the service worker (if it exists), and calls it when sveltekit detects that a new version has been deployed.\r\ni'm not sure if this is the right place to

don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12448/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12448/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14586052221,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5C0_fazwAAAANlZX59","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/14586052221","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-10T07:50:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14586052242,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5C0_fazwAAAANlZX6S","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/14586052242","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"8aa95b4b3431e79f62f580abdcdcb157b4de86cd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/8aa95b4b3431e79f62f580abdcdcb157b4de86cd","created_at":"2024-10-10T07:50:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
