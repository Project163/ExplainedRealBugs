Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts.
