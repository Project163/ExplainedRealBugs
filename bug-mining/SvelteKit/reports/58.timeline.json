And why is there an SSR request anyway?

That `fetch` really belongs in the component's `load` function, but if you really _must_ put it inside the component itself, it should be inside an `onMount` otherwise the `fetch` will happen during SSR but will have no effect (because by the time it resolves, the page has already rendered).\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1124382826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6594186783,"node_id":"MIE_lADOEiPr8c5DEdi-zwAAAAGJC04f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6594186783","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-11T23:32:48Z","milestone":{"title":"1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1125980897","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3748#issuecomment-1125980897","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3748","id":1125980897,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5DHRrh","user":{"login":"fehnomenal","id":9959940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NTk5NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9959940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehnomenal","html_url":"https://github.com/fehnomenal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehnomenal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehnomenal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehnomenal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehnomenal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehnomenal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehnomenal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehnomenal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehnomenal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fehnomenal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-13T11:58:18Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T11:58:18Z","body":"I have a similar \"problem\" (quotes because it does not really break anything but my client wants to get rid of errors in the console).\r\n\r\nI noticed that only Chrome/Chromium loads the favicon on each navigation, on Firefox it is fine.\r\n\r\nThe issue (console errors) happens when the url generated by `%svelte.assets%` (which is relative) is no longer valid when resolving to the url after navigating.

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nNot 100% sure if i'm doing something wrong but i expect this to be a bug since i can only reproduce it in Chrome and not on any other browser (didn't try Edge).\r\n\r\n**What is going wrong?**\r\nWhile navigating through my project and loading some pages i see endpoints being called that shouldn't be called.

I think the reason for this that the link somehow doesn't update and Chrome requests the favicon again. Initially, the link is `./favicon.png` and resolves to `/favicon.png`. When you go to `/a/b` the link is still same (`./favicon.png`) and now resolves to `/a/favicon.png` which is the wrong path and Chrome requests it again.
