The reason for that is that in most environments (Vercel included) there isn't even an opportunity to run SvelteKit if a matching file exists on the filesystem. The 405 you're seeing is coming from Vercel itself, which sees a request for `/bob`, sees that there's a matching `bob/index.html` file already prerendered, then says 'hang on a minute, you can't POST to a prerendered file'.\r\n\r\nSo you'll always need to disable prerendering for these pages. We could probably do a better job of diagnosing this at build time — if a page is shadowed by an endpoint, prerendering should fail. (When we implement #3532, we can change that to 'if a page is shadowed by an endpoint with non-GET handlers'.)","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1021494110/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1021498091","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3410#issuecomment-1021498091","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3410","id":1021498091,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c484tLr","user":{"login":"alexbjorlig","id":9967422,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Njc0MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9967422?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbjorlig","html_url":"https://github.com/alexbjorlig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbjorlig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbjorlig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbjorlig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbjorlig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbjorlig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbjorlig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbjorlig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbjorlig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexbjorlig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-25T18:45:29Z","updated_at":"2022-01-25T18:45:29Z","body":"Hi @Rich-Harris  - thanks for the detailed update, makes total sense.
