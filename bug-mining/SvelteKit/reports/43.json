An endpoint file named /favicon.ico.js does run at all and a 404 is returned instead.  While static assets can be served on the `/favicon.ico` path, the endpoint cannot; this limits `/favicon.ico` severely for anything more than one file (or some file swapping).  \r\n\r\nAdjustments can be made with `rel=\"icon\"` to use a different path, but /favicon.ico is a well known path and should be supported with endpoints.  \n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-rk12yp?file=src/routes/favicon.ico.js\r\nhttps://github.com/bakkerthehacker/sveltejs-kit-template-default-rk12yp (empty, syncing from stackblitz not working)\r\n\r\n/favicon.ico.js and /favicon2.ico.js both have 302 redirects to /todos\r\n\r\nlocalhost:3000/favicon2.ico -> 302 redirects to /todos as expected\r\n\r\nlocalhost:3000/favicon.ico -> 404\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nenvinfo doesnt run with `--system` on stackblitz\r\n\r\n❯ npx envinfo --binaries --browsers --npmPackages \"{svelte,@sveltejs/*,vite}\"\r\nsuccess Install finished in 0.399s\r\n\r\n\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.2 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.10 - /bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 7.17.0 - /bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.42 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.330 \r\n    svelte: ^3.46.0 => 3.48.0\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nSee this comment on the previous favicon.ico PR: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/3559#issuecomment-1123965927","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4968/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4968/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
