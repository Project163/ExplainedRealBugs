Describe the problem\r\n\r\nThe module=context \"load function\" fetches data twice, once on the server and once on the client. \r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nIdeally, there should

Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI've been using SvelteKit for a while now and only today I learned that depending on whether I pass `fetch` as a param in the load function, I get a \"special fetch\" or

It looks really good, almost magical.....a little too magical. Unless you read the documentation very thoroughly before you begin (or you learn the hard way as I did) it's easy to miss that the fetch is special.\r\n\r\nI don't care what the special fetch is called, be it `specialFetch`, `svelteFetch`, `magicLoad` or whatever else - but calling it `fetch` is too confusing, imho.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nRename `fetch` passed to the `load` function to something more distinct. \r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nAlternatively - overwrite all fetch calls to be special fetch calls, at least that'll be consistent monkey patching.\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4193/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1059435343","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3731#issuecomment-1059435343","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3731","id":1059435343,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c4_JbNP","user":{"login":"newlegendmedia","id":540520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDUyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/540520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newlegendmedia","html_url":"https://github.com/newlegendmedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newlegendmedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newlegendmedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newlegendmedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newlegendmedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newlegendmedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newlegendmedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newlegendmedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newlegendmedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newlegendmedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-04T19:01:52Z","updated_at":"2022-03-04T19:01:52Z","body":"To clarify, this issue seems to be saying that a fetch in the load function could/would be called in the browser if it's not the load special fetch?

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4958/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6618979728,"node_id":"MIE_lADOEiPr8c5DBYAZzwAAAAGKhZ2Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6618979728","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-16T19:53:04Z","milestone":{"title":"1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6651831509,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5DBYAZzwAAAAGMeuTV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6651831509","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"84a41ab5fad3f9b5fd593d7580479a643f1d3da2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/84a41ab5fad3f9b5fd593d7580479a643f1d3da2","created_at":"2022-05-20T15:55:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6652270560,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5DBYAZzwAAAAGMgZfg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6652270560","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-20T17:01:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6652270705,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5DBYAZzwAAAAGMgZhx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6652270705","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscript
