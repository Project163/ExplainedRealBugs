clicking a link like `<a href=\"/foo\">` will fail if `/foo` doesn't 'belong' to the app — it will result in the error page being rendered with a synthetic 404. In cases where `/foo` is a real resource (handled by a separate app on the same domain, or a file in `static`, etc) we need to add `rel=\"external\"` to trick the router into ignoring it in order to avoid that unwanted behaviour.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, if a link doesn't match a route in the manifest, we fall back to a full page navigation instead, allowing the browser to access the resource. In the case where the link doesn't go anywhere, Kit will still respond with a 404, it'll just be from the server instead of the client-side router.\r\n\r\nCloses #3935.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpx changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit

Describe the bug\n\ni had a bug reported here: https://twitter.com/clearhunch/status/1494317555275677696?s=21\r\n\r\nthat essentially came from me using a prefetch link (`<a svelte:prefetch href=“/LIP”>`) for a url that only exists as a serverside redirect (in netlify). in a normal a href context that would work. but sveltekit is being too smart, or not smart enough, here. it checks its cache for a page called “LIP”, and not finding it, returns a 404 and end of story. i think it should deopt from clientside navigation and go actually check the network, and let the 404 handling happen there (again via sveltekit).\r\n\r\nsee what i mean? basically the only reason we do clientside nav is to make it fast, but we dont have to be fast for 404’s.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nthe diff i made https://github.com/sw-yx/swyxdotio/commit/4f16ef636cf4e98961fa03cf63e5ad5f25a60a4b\r\n\r\n\r\nits really obvious but it is an abstraction leak, and yes i know i could just remove prefetch but why make me check \n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nn/a\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No
