I propose to draw a clearer distinction between `+server.ts` and the other +files.\r\n\r\nFor example, an auth guard placed in `routes/(app)/+layout.server.ts` does not protect `routes/(app)/api/+server.ts`. ([relevant discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/457912077277855764/1254872342182760449))\r\n\r\nAn inverse example showing the other +files are highly connected is when using `+page@.svelte`. In this case, it also affects which `+page(.server).ts` gets loaded.\r\n\r\nThe above shows that of the 4 +files, `+server.ts` is logically distinct. Aside from using the same file system to determine its route, it has nothing to do with the other 3 +files and doesn't inherit from any of them.\r\n\r\nBut the docs seem to imply that `+server.ts` is a part of the family in the way that it is presented:\r\n- [`+layout and +error files apply to subdirectories as well as the directory they live in`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing)\r\n- ![image](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/assets/2974920/539e553d-a18b-43c4-84cc-e60906c4f956)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\n.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12401/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
