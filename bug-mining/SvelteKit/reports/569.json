Simplified usage example:\n\n`page.svelte`\n```svelte\n<Form issues={remoteForm.fields.allIssues()} {...} />\n```\n`form.svelte`\n```svelte\n<script>\n  let { issues = [], fields, ... } = $props() \n\n  const fieldErrors = $derived(Object.groupBy(issues, (i) => i.path[0]))\n</script>\n\n{#each fields as field (field.name)}\n  <label for={field.name}>{field.title}</label>\n  {#if field.type === 'text'}\n     <input name={field.name} />\n  {/if}\n  {#each fieldErrors.get(field.name) as error}\n    <p>{error.message}</p>\n  {/each}\n{/each}\n```\nNOTE: This is not a SvelteKit-specific component, so using `remoteFunction.fields.fieldName.issues()` is not suitable.\n\nThis property could also be useful for implementing the [Error summary](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/) pattern — specifically for generating links to the fields containing errors.\n\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nExpose the `issue.path` property\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14688/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14688/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
