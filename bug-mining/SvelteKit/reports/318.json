Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThe adapter should include any assets inside the `client` output folder instead `_app` only (`kit.appDir`).\r\n\r\nLatest changes in kit allow plugins to emit/generate assets in the client folder: `@vite-pwa/sveltekit`, `sitemap`...\r\n\r\nThe problem is here: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/adapter-cloudflare/index.js#L42 (should include the client folder)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n~~no, sorry, just reported from Discord here:
