Just a failing test for now (have to run, will implement later if time allows).~~\r\n\r\nBasic strategy:\r\n\r\n* Track, in `load_server_data`, what gets used (`url`, `params.foo`, `parent`)\r\n* Send that information to the client alongside `data`\r\n* On navigation, when requesting `__data.json`, specify (probably in a custom header) which nodes have been invalidated (i.e. if a node uses `url`, it will always be invalid if the URL has changed; if it uses `params.foo`, it is only invalid if `params.foo` has changed; if it uses `parent` then it will be invalid if any parent is invalid)\r\n* On the server, only run the invalid nodes, return a value like `-1` for everything that remains valid. If an invalid node _unexpectedly_ calls `await parent`, run everything upstream as well\r\n* On the server, fill in the `-1` values from memory\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6056/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":6,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6056/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7242580927,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5P70_AzwAAAAGvsQO_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7242580927","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"2e9487ed08f48e10eeb576ac2a31f5db89fdecb9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/2e9487ed08f48e10eeb576ac2a31f5db89fdecb9","created_at":"2022-08-23T14:29:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
