However inside `resolve_entry` we check if it's a directory and if it's a directory we resolve index on that directory\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/78404dfe1eb346723eefc183278b85f25485b419/packages/kit/src/utils/filesystem.js#L169-L191\r\n\r\nWhat we should do is probably check also for the file and if there's a file AND a directory give precedence to the file.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. go [here](https://www.sveltelab.dev/pia98ep9vdjyeyz)\r\n2. check that only the `hooks.server.ts` handle function is logging to the terminal\r\n3. delete the `hooks` folder\r\n4. check that now also the `reroute` function is logging to the console\r\n5. optionally create a folder named `hooks.server` (you need to refresh the page for it to take fully effect...bug in sveltelab sorry 😅)\r\n6. check that now no hook is logged\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.0 undefined\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 0 Bytes / 0 Bytes\r\n    Shell: 1.0 - /bin/jsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.20.3 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 10.2.3 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n    pnpm: 8.15.6 - /usr/local/bin/pnpm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^3.0.0 => 3.3.1 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^2.5.27 => 2.9.0 \r\n    @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte: ^4.0.0 => 4.0.2 \r\n    svelte: ^5.0.0 => 5.4.0 \r\n    vite: ^5.4.4 => 5.4.11\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThis can be very hard to debug.","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13100/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
