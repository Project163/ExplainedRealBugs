For me, a person that knows both syntaxes well, this might be a small problem.\r\n\r\nBut I already saw a few people struggle because they were new to JSDoc comments and didn't know how the equivalent should look in TypeScript code. Having a proper TypeScript example would help them a lot.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nA toggle could be provided somewhere on the docs page that allows to globally choose between `JSDoc` and `TypeScript`\r\n\r\nSimilar to the [Vue.js documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) that allows to toggle between API styles.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nJSDoc only examples\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4452/reactions","total_count":22,"+1":22,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4452/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
