Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpx changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4230/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6189885362,"node_id":"MIE_lADOEiPr8c5E98m9zwAAAAFw8iey","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6189885362","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-05T21:32:11Z","milestone":{"title":"whenever"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"aolose","id":7620293,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjAyOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7620293?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aolose","html_url":"https://github.com/aolose","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aolose/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aolose/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aolose/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aolose/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aolose/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aolose/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aolose/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aolose/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aolose/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-06T14:09:34Z","updated_at":"2022-03-06T14:09:34Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4246","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4246/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4246/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4246/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4246","id":1160620524,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c40AMTj","number":4246,"title":"SearchBox
