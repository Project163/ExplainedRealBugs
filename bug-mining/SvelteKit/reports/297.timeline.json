I use mysql connection pools and on shutdown need to call pool.end() otherwise I have found the database can hang. The cases it would usually hang are definitely due to bugs in my app, but shutting down gracefully makes sure my bugs don't hang the database.\r\n\r\nBefore migrating to sveltekit I would wait for the http server to close before calling pool.end(). e.g.,\r\n```process.on('SIGINT', () => server.close(() => pool.end()));```  Using adapter-node, I have not figured out a way to achieve the same thing. \r\n\r\nIt might be safe for me to call pool.end() with out waiting for the server to close. The app is shutting down anyway, so a potential brief window of the server running but the pool being closed is probably not an issue.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1275194455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tsmigiel","id":8260153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjAxNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8260153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel","html_url":"https://github.com/tsmigiel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1279622636","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6841#issuecomment-1279622636","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6841","id":1279622636,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5MRX3s","user":{"login":"tsmigiel","id":8260153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjAxNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8260153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel","html_url":"https://github.com/tsmigiel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsmigiel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-15T01:16:55Z","updated_at":"2022-10-15T01:16:55Z","body":"To follow up on my example.

That's what my entry.js listens for and when containers are told to stop they send a SIGTERM to your process, if the application does not shutdown it gets killed (signal = SIGKILL) and has no chance to do cleanup, it just dies. When using docker/podman your process receives a SIGTERM and has 10 seconds to shutdown by default, after that it will be killed with SIGKILL.\r\n\r\nIf you don't need a container you may just use the entry.js for graceful shutodwn, but I assume you'd rather see this officially supported which makes sense to me, too.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1330851668/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"konstantinblaesi","id":5871169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzExNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5871169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/konstantinblaesi","html_url":"https://github.com/konstantinblaesi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konstantinblaesi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konstantinblaesi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konstantinblaesi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konstantinblaesi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konstantinblaesi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konstantinblaesi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konstantinblaesi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konstantinblaesi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konstantinblaesi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7913921745,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c5R9XFCzwAAAAHXtNzR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7913921745","actor":null,"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-29T15:45:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7913921758,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5R9XFCzwAAAAHXtNze","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7913921758","actor":null,"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-29T15:45:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1331272656","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6841#issuecomment-1331272656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6841","id":1331272656,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5PWZvQ","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-29T20:40:38Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T20:40:38Z","body":"> @IRod22 sorry to disappoint you but your development setup is not my concern, . . .\r\nI know that, @konstantinblaesi.
