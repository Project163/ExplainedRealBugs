Netlify and Vercel deployments are succeeding as well. As soon as I launch the page though, I am running into a completely useless \"500 internal error\" without any further logs or information about what the problem is. \r\n\r\nI encounter these errors on all pages which load blog posts with code like `const allPosts = await fetch('/blog.json')`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI can offer to set my project temporarily to be public so that the code can be inspected.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.15 Manjaro Linux\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz\r\n    Memory: 6.96 GB / 15.61 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.12.1 - ~/.volta/tools/image/node/18.12.1/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - ~/.volta/tools/image/yarn/1.22.19/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.16.0 - ~/.volta/tools/image/npm/8.16.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 108.1.46.140\r\n    Firefox: 107.0.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-netlify: 1.0.0-next.85 => 1.0.0-next.85 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.0.0-next.579 => 1.0.0-next.579 \r\n    svelte: ^3.54.0 => 3.54.0 \r\n    vite: ^4.0.0 => 4.0.0\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nblocking all usage of SvelteKit\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8039/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
