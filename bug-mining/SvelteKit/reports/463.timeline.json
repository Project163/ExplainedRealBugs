this was an accidental breaking change as part of #10994, strictly speaking.

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11727/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11727/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12024575068,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c588iQ0zwAAAALMuHRc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/12024575068","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-06T08:55:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12024575217,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c588iQ0zwAAAALMuHTx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/12024575217","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"30c78f223a4f9e6c4547d087338a8b8cc477ba55","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/30c78f223a4f9e6c4547d087338a8b8cc477ba55","created_at":"2024-03-06T08:55:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jasonlyu123","id":36730922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzMwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36730922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlyu123","html_url":"https://github.com/jasonlyu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlyu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlyu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlyu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlyu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlyu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlyu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlyu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlyu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasonlyu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-06T09:03:50Z","updated_at":"2024-03-06T09:03:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/2306","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/language-tools","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/2306/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/2306/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/2306/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools/issues/2306","id":2163186753,"node_id":"I_kwDODsEpNs6A75xB","number":2306,"title":"False

Describe the bug\n\nUsing `URLSearchParams` in a .svelte file brings up a diagnostic message:  \"missing property\"  and therefore courses the highlighting of the following methods:\r\n\r\n- keys\r\n- values\r\n- entries\r\n\r\nWhereas all the other methods (append, delete, get, getAll, has, set, sort, toString, forEach) seem to be supported by the repo just fine.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n```\r\n<script lang=\"ts\">\r\n  new URLSearchParams(...).keys();\r\n  new URLSearchParams(...).values();\r\n  new URLSearchParams(...).entries();\r\n\r\n</script>\r\n```\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nSince the above mentioned Class methods are well supported in modern browsers, they should not cause a diagnostic message in .svelte files saying \"missing property\".\n\n### System Info\n\n- OS: [e.g. Windows]\r\n- IDE: [e.g. VSCode, Atom]\r\n\n\n### Which package is the issue about?\n\nSvelte for VS Code extension\n\n### Additional Information, eg. Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"475\" alt=\"Bildschirmfoto 2024-03-01 um 11 21 51\"

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked.
