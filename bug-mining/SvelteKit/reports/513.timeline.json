new to SvelteKit and had the same issue with CRUD delete. I currently work around it with:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nawait goto(parentLocation)\r\ninvalidateAll() // presumably will work also for specific invalidations\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I didn't know about the [goto](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$app-navigation-goto) `invalidateAll` param so I can try that now obviously.)\r\n\r\nThis seems to correctly cause the invalidation after the goto, so it doesn't hit the 404 between the delete and goto parent. The GET/read then doesn't need to have a default redirect to parent on not found (I'd prefer we get proper 404 when an ID doesn't exist).\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is idiomatic and feels potentially brittle? But working. If relevant, it's currently executing in an onResult callback in [superforms](https://superforms.rocks/), I'm unsure exactly how that might affect the page lifecycle so YMMV.\r\n\r\nAlso wasn't exactly sure what you meant by:\r\n> goto(invalidateAll) won't really work if you have unrelated parametrized load functions in previous segments of the URL (ie if you're using depends anywhere).\r\n\r\nSo apologies if that makes this workaround not

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [ ] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked.
