However, when I click the cancel button it still tries to post to the current route, and I got an error because I didn't have any actions set up for the current route (the formaction on the submit button was posting to a different route). I tried removing `method=\"post\"` from the form element, but I got an error saying that `use:enhance` only works on form elements using `method=\"post\"`. Since `formmethod=\"dialog\"` doesn't actually send a request and just closes the modal, I expected this to work.\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<dialog>\r\n  <form\r\n    method=\"post\"\r\n    use:enhance\r\n  >\r\n    ...other form stuff\r\n\r\n    <button type=\"submit\" formmethod=\"dialog\"> Cancel </button>\r\n    <button type=\"submit\" formaction=\"/another-page?/submitSomething\"> Submit </button>\r\n  </form>\r\n</dialog>\r\n```\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nIt would be awesome if `use:enhance` could be modified to accommodate `formmethod=\"dialog\"`.\r\nMaybe when `use:enhance` is handling the submission, it could check to see if the button that submitted the form has `formmethod=\"dialog\"` set, and if so it could just bail out since nothing actually needs to be submitted.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe workaround isn't too bad, but it does require JavaScript since the button has to specify an on:click event to call the `dialog.close()` function. `formmethod=\"dialog\"` is just a really slick way of handling modals, especially since it doesn't require JavaScript to work.\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<script>\r\n  let dialog\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<dialog bind:this={dialog}>\r\n  <form\r\n    method=\"post\"\r\n    use:enhance\r\n  >\r\n    ...other form stuff\r\n\r\n    <button type=\"button\" on:click={() => dialog.close()}> Cancel </button>\r\n    <button type=\"submit\" formaction=\"/another-page?/submitSomething\"> Submit </button>\r\n  </form>\r\n</dialog>\r\n```\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10092/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
