Setting `cors: true` isn't a solution and is explicitly [recommended against](https://vite.dev/config/server-options#server-cors) in the Vite docs. This seems to be a SvelteKit-specific issue, like sapphi-red explained, and isn't related to their recent CORS changes.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/2661142266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stephenlrandall","id":41397226,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzk3MjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41397226?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenlrandall","html_url":"https://github.com/stephenlrandall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenlrandall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenlrandall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenlrandall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenlrandall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenlrandall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenlrandall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenlrandall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenlrandall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephenlrandall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16322796300,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c6nEnq_zwAAAAPM6hsM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/16322796300","actor":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-15T23:14:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16322796306,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c6nEnq_zwAAAAPM6hsS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/16322796306","actor":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-15T23:14:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16326864606,"node_id":"REE_lADOEiPr8c6nEnq_zwAAAAPNKC7e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/16326864606","actor":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-17T03:41:14Z","state_reason":"reopened","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16326869606,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked.

Describe the bug\n\nA follow-up to #13362. When using `import.meta.glob` and then fetching the resulting files, any non-inlined assets in the built application have `/_app/immutable/...` paths. When deployed (https://stephenlrandall.github.io/kit-preview-issue/), this works fine. But during `preview`, \"Not found\" errors are produced.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/stephenlrandall/kit-preview-issue\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\nrequesting resource: /_app/immutable/assets/sample.lmZegr8j.json\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token 'N', \"Not found\" is not valid JSON\n    at JSON.parse (<anonymous>)\n    at Proxy.<anonymous> (file:///Users/randasl1/Desktop/kit-cors-issue/.svelte-kit/output/server/index.js:1324:25)\n    at async load (file:///Users/randasl1/Desktop/kit-cors-issue/.svelte-kit/output/server/entries/pages/_page.js:8:16)\n    at async load_data (file:///Users/randasl1/Desktop/kit-cors-issue/.svelte-kit/output/server/index.js:1231:18)\n    at async file:///Users/randasl1/Desktop/kit-cors-issue/.svelte-kit/output/server/index.js:2794:18\n```\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\n    OS: macOS 15.3.1\n    CPU: (16) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\n    Memory: 47.19 MB / 16.00 GB\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 20.8.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\n    npm: 10.1.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 10.4.1 - /usr/local/bin/pnpm\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 133.0.6943.127\n    Edge: 133.0.3065.82\n    Safari: 18.3\n  npmPackages:\n    @sveltejs/adapter-static: ^3.0.8 => 3.0.8 \n    @sveltejs/kit: ^2.17.3 => 2.17.3 \n    @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte: ^4.0.4 => 4.0.4 \n    svelte: ^5.20.4 => 5.20.4 \n    vite: ^5.4.14 => 5.4.14\n```\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThe workaround is to just not use `preview`, which isn't the end of the world but isn't really a workaround either.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13503/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
