I tried experimenting with this on my Windows machine and the only way I succeeded to reliably get no errors in the tests was to lower the workers count (in the playwright config), and I guess the reason for it is that Windows is worse at dealing with CPU and RAM than the Linux/MacOS are. \r\nRecommended and the default amount of workers for playwright test is the half of the amount of CPU cores on the machine (source: https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/512a245f135e7c2430aebc698b65a299fe07dac6/packages/playwright-test/types/test.d.ts#L628 ) and the number of the CPU cores on the Github Actions Windows machines is 2 (source: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources ) \r\nI have a laptop with i5 processor with 4 CPU cores and 8GB of RAM (not bad, not great obviously) and still when I run the test with 8 workers I get error and the machine slows down a bit, so no wonder the Windows VM fails.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1025163835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PH4NTOMiki","id":35368241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY4MjQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35368241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PH4NTOMiki","html_url":"https://github.com/PH4NTOMiki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PH4NTOMiki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PH4NTOMiki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PH4NTOMiki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PH4NTOMiki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PH4NTOMiki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PH4NTOMiki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PH4NTOMiki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PH4NTOMiki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PH4NTOMiki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5976436742,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c5Ce66ZzwAAAAFkOTAG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/5976436742","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-30T15:11:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5976436743,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5Ce66ZzwAAAAFkOTAH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/5976436743","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-30T15:11:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1025164839","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3552#issuecomment-1025164839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3552","id":1025164839,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c49GsYn","user":{"login":"bluwy","id":34116392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTE2Mzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34116392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluwy","html_url":"https://github.com/bluwy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluwy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluwy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluwy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluwy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluwy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluwy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluwy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluwy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluwy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-30T15:16:17Z","updated_at":"2022-01-30T15:16:17Z","body":"That's

Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpx changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttempting to resolve #3552\r\n\r\nFirst, the obligatory \"it works on my machine\"...\r\n\r\nIn attempting to address this issue, I encountered the following underlying difficulties:\r\n 1) Addressing \"prefetches programmatically\" test race by waiting for playwright network event\r\n 2) Handling environment dependent network requests issued by \"prefetches programmatically\" test\r\n 3) Addressing visibility issues by using playwright's page.isVisible method\r\n 4) Random test timeouts on my local machine, and apparently also in other environments according to [discord](https://discord.com/channels/457912077277855764/750401468569354431/939343653434982451). These were addressed by bumping the window.setTimeout threshold from 2s to 5s AND the test harness from 10s to 15s in utils.js, both of which were required.\r\n\r\nFurther info on changes for \"prefetches programmatically\" test, the following debug output\r\n```\r\nconsole.log(`waiting for ${baseURL}/routing/prefetched.json`);\r\nrequests.forEach((req) => {\r\n  console.log(`req was: ${req}`);\r\n});\r\n```\r\nResulted in\r\n```\r\nwaiting for http://localhost:3000/routing/prefetched.json\r\nreq was: http://localhost:3000/src/routes/routing/prefetched/index.svelte\r\nreq was: http://localhost:3000/@fs/C:/kit/packages/kit/src/runtime/env.js\r\nreq was: http://localhost:3000/routing/prefetched.json\r\n\r\nwaiting for http://localhost:3000/routing/prefetched.json\r\nreq was: http://localhost:3000/src/routes/routing/prefetched/index.svelte\r\nreq was: http://localhost:3000/routing/prefetched.json\r\n\r\nwaiting for http://localhost:3000/routing/prefetched.json\r\nreq was: http://localhost:3000/_app/pages/routing/prefetched/index.svelte-b0244d07.js\r\nreq was: http://localhost:3000/routing/prefetched.json\r\n```\r\nNote depending upon the vite mode, sometimes a third \"fs\" path would be fetched.\r\n\r\nPossible improvements:\r\n  1) Unfortunately, the sets_paths and trailingSlash tests still fail on windows, seemingly reliably at least. Should I open a separate issue for this?\r\n  2) Should the integration timeout values just be changed to the following, in order to account for additional failures mentioned in the [discord discussion](https://discord.com/channels/457912077277855764/750401468569354431/939343653434982451):\r\n     timeout: process.env.CI ? 45000 : 15000,\r\n\r\n\r\nAll feedback welcome!\r\n\r\nLast but not least thank you so much for your efforts on this project, SvelteKit and Svelte are wonderful!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3741/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3741/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6037893650,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5Ce66ZzwAAAAFn4vIS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6037893650","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-09T22:51:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
