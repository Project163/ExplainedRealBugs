How to migration from named layouts\r\n\r\nNamed layouts have been removed in favor of `(groups)`. See the documentation for an introduction: https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/advanced-routing#advanced-layouts\r\n\r\nHow to migrate highly depends on your use case:\r\n\r\n### Use case 1: Rewinding to an earlier layout / \"breaking out\"\r\n\r\nIf you used named layouts to rewind the layout inheritance chain to a layout higher up the tree, you can reference the segment directly now:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nsrc/routes/\r\n├ marketing/\r\n│ ├ pricing/\r\n│ │ ├ business/\r\n│ │ │ └ +layout@marketing.svelte // reference the \"marketing\" segment (i.e. the folder with the name) in your routes\r\n│ │ └ +layout.svelte\r\n- ├ +layout-marketing.svelte\r\n- ├ +layout@marketing.svelte\r\n+ └ +layout.svelte\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use case 2: Rewinding to a blank root layout\r\n\r\nIf you had `+layout-blank.svelte` in your root to reset to a blank layout, you need to adjust your actual root layout to be blank and move that functionality into another layout further below in the tree, either using an if-statement in your root layout or using the `(group)` feature:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nsrc/routes/\r\n+ (main)\r\n+ ├ marketing/\r\n+ │ ├ pricing/\r\n+ │ │ └ +layout@.svelte\r\n+ └ +layout.svelte // this is now what used to be src/routes/+layout.svelte\r\n- marketing/\r\n- ├ pricing/\r\n- │ └ +layout@blank.svelte\r\n- +layout-blank.svelte\r\n└ +layout.svelte // this is now what used to be src/routes/+layout-blank.svelte\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use case 3: Different layouts for routes at the same nesting level\r\n\r\nIf you used named layouts to specify \"these 2 pages get layout X and these other 2 next to them get layout Y\", use groups instead.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nsrc/routes/\r\n├ about/\r\n│ └ +page@unauthed.svelte\r\n├ admin/\r\n│ └ +page@authed.svelte\r\n├ home\r\n│ └ +page@unauthed.svelte\r\n├ user/\r\n│ └ +page@authed.svelte\r\n├ +layout-authed.svelte\r\n└ +layout-unauthed.svelte\r\n```\r\nAfter\r\n```\r\nsrc/routes/\r\n├ (authed)\r\n│ ├ admin/\r\n│ │ └ +page.svelte\r\n│ ├ user/\r\n│ │ └ +page.svelte\r\n│ └ +layout.svelte\r\n├ (unauthed)\r\n│ ├ about/\r\n│ │ └ +page.svelte\r\n│ ├ home\r\n│ │ └ +page.svelte\r\n│ └ +layout.svelte\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use case 4: arbitrary inheritance chains\r\n\r\nIf you previously used named layouts to enhance other named layouts, which also enhance layouts, to mix and match them, then that's no longer possible this way. In cases like this - which from reading the layout chains probably got confusing anyway - we advice to use composition and/or if-statements instead. The new documentation has a section with an example for this as inspiration.\r\n\r\n# PR description\r\n\r\n#6124 \r\n\r\nCloses #6196 (using `(groups)` and/or composition)\r\nCloses #5763 (root layout guaranteed to always exist + `await parent()`)\r\nCloses #5311 (`+page@.svelte`)\r\nCloses #4940 (no longer possible to get into this situation)\r\nCloses #2154 (only a single root layout now)\r\n\r\n\r\n* [x] documentation\r\n* [x] prevent conflicts\r\n* [x] print useful error when encountering a `+layout-foo.svelte`\r\n* [x] simplify the code that currently has to deal with named layouts\r\n* [x] update `write_types`\r\n* [x] don't reference root layout/error in `dictionary` in `client-manifest.js`\r\n* [x] get it to work in windows\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist!

For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6174/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":6,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7250956368,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5QWmc_zwAAAAGwMNBQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7250956368","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-24T13:25:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7250956720,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5QWmc_zwAAAAGwMNGw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7250956720","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"27172f732ed1283b5470ace952f46bfe48820c0a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/27172f732ed1283b5470ace952f46bfe48820c0a","created_at":"2022-08-24T13:25:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
