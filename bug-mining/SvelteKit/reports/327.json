I finally discovered it was because the `throw redirect()` was inside a try-catch block, see example below:\r\n```js\r\nexport const actions : {\r\n\tdefault: async(event) => {\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tauthenticate(...);\r\n\t\t\tthrow redirect(301, '/success');\r\n\t\t} catch (error) {\r\n\t\t\t// Redirect being caught here as an error\r\n\t\t\treturn fail()\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThe `redirect()` is being caught as an error and the route won't redirect. I encountered this problem while migrating code from an older sveltekit project where the try-catch pattern of coding worked perfectly by returning a header instead. It wasn't obvious to me what I was doing wrong and console logging the `error` did not provide any clues to that end. I think I missed it, and many more might, because of Sveltekit's innovative use of `throw`.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\n1. I suggest putting a warning in the documentation, especially for the sake of beginners, so that if anyone get's stuck and turn to the docs, they can find a clue.\r\n\r\n2. Sveltekit displays a more descriptive error in the console if the try-catch or similar pattern is to be used in conjunction with `throw redirect()` and similar `throws`.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8689/reactions","total_count":19,"+1":19,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
