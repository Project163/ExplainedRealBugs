Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19786705394,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c7Mij0VzwAAAASbYSny","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/19786705394","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"05e9b8b7c2c8f460ad8646a01b1aa6e62e7cc46a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/05e9b8b7c2c8f460ad8646a01b1aa6e62e7cc46a","created_at":"2025-09-18T22:40:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19786802330,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c7Mij0VzwAAAASbYqSa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/19786802330","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-18T22:53:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19786883160,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c7Mij0VzwAAAASbY-BY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/19786883160","actor":{"login":"woss","id":80440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/woss","html_url":"https://github.com/woss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"46f12cfcbc6ee826ffeb96be527bb273cac70620","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/woss/fork-sveltekit/commits/46f12cfcbc6ee826ffeb96be527bb273cac70620","created_at":"2025-09-18T23:03:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/3314744542","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/14473#issuecomment-3314744542","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14473","id":3314744542,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c7Fkvze","user":{"login":"haq-m","id":17065960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDY1OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17065960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haq-m","html_url":"https://github.com/haq-m","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haq-m/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haq-m/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haq-m/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.gith
