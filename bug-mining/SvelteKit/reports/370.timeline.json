@s3812497 Sorry if we were not clear, but the issue is happening when you click on a link _after_ the download link. You are correct that the search is empty when clicking on the download link, but once the download is complete and another link on the page is clicked, I would expect the from.url.search to match the browser's address bar?\r\n\r\nThank you for the clarification. I think the issue is that after clicking on the \"external\" link (in this case the download), [sveltekit sets the `navigating` flag to true but never resets it on the next click.](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/a59997dbe2ceb0706bca360528c8362f5dc6d31a/packages/kit/src/runtime/client/client.js#L1519) Hence, [clicking on your next link doesn't call `beforeNavigate`.](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/a59997dbe2ceb0706bca360528c8362f5dc6d31a/packages/kit/src/runtime/client/client.js#L1084)\r\n\r\nThe simple fix would be to [reset `navigating`
