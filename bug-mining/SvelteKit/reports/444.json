However, upon building the application, I noticed that the output in the `build` folder contains only absolute paths.\r\n\r\nThis issue only occurs when `ssr = false` and there are no pre-rendered pages. If there is at least one pre-rendered page, the paths are indeed relative (`./` on the scripts, and `base: new URL(\".\", location).pathname.slice(0, -1)`).\r\n\r\nMy use case is somewhat specialized: I am attempting to build a [Twitch Extension](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/), which technically operates as a static website. Hence, I need my app to be an SPA. \r\nTwitch extensions encounter a similar issue to IPFS: one doesn't know the base path until the extension is opened on the site. The URL is composed like so: `[extension-host-domain]/[twitch-extension-id]/[extension-version]/[upload-id]`, with the last `upload-id` being the unknown variable. This is my understanding based on the documentation and inspection.\r\n\r\nFrom my interpretation of #595, the `kit.paths.relative: true` configuration should have resolved this issue, but it appears not to function as expected. I also tried using `sveltekit-adapter-ipfs`, but without success (I am dealing with a separate issue related to a missing `paths-` file).\r\n\r\nI have created a simple repository where `pnpm build` generates these incorrect paths.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I am making a mistake, but I cannot understand what it is.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nLuigi\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/Giggiux/reproduce-no-ssr-relative\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 13.4.1\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700HQ CPU @ 2.80GHz\r\n    Memory: 15.44 MB / 16.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.16.0 - ~/.volta/tools/image/node/18.16.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 3.5.1 - ~/.volta/tools/image/yarn/3.5.1/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 9.6.6 - ~/.volta/tools/image/npm/9.6.6/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 114.1.52.126\r\n    Chrome: 114.0.5735.133\r\n    Safari: 16.5.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^2.0.0 => 2.1.0\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-static: ^2.0.2 => 2.0.2\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.20.4 => 1.20.5\r\n    svelte: ^4.0.0 => 4.0.0\r\n    vite: ^4.3.6 => 4.3.9\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10235/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10235/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
