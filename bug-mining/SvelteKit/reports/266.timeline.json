Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8003/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8001210305,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5YiHPhzwAAAAHc6MfB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8001210305","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-09T19:00:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8001210346,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5YiHPhzwAAAAHc6Mfq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8001210346","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ca01b3bb8e84a8aa3056c9c38ffc846c9859f94f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/ca01b3bb8e84a8aa3056c9c38ffc846c9859f94f","created_at":"2022-12-09T19:00:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8001642773,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5YiHPhzwAAAAHc72EV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8001642773","actor":{"login":"jochemvogel","id":34123512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTIzNTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34123512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jochemvogel","html_url":"https://github.com/jochemvogel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jochemvogel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jochemvogel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jochemvogel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jochemvogel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jochemvogel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jochemvogel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jochemvogel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jochemvogel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jochemvogel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-09T19:54:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
