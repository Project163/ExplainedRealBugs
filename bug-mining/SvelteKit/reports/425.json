It seems likely that the change from https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/releases/tag/%40sveltejs%2Fkit%401.22.1 is responsible:\r\n\r\n> perf: only have Vite generate relative paths when required\r\n\r\nI noticed probably relevant changes in `build/_app/immutable/entry/app.*.js`:\r\n\r\n- In 1.22.0, it loads additional JS chunks from a relative path, like `../chunks/...`\r\n- In 1.22.1, it loads them from `_app/immutable/chunks/...`, which does not work.\r\n\r\n[@benmccann suggested](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/10287#issuecomment-1627709727) that `paths.relative` may fix it, but it doesn't seem like that to me.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"738\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-07-10 13 47 53@2x\" src=\"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/assets/2098462/c4f46c8f-cddd-4098-b591-e20bf7181a55\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI prepared a minimal reproduction that demonstrates and explains this better than a lot of prose, I think.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to downgrade back to SvelteKit 1.22.0.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/danieldiekmeier/reproduction-sveltekit-relative\r\n\r\nReproduction steps are in the README.md.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 13.4.1\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max\r\n    Memory: 83.11 MB / 64.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.16.0 - ~/.asdf/installs/nodejs/18.16.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - ~/.asdf/installs/nodejs/18.16.0/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 9.5.1 - ~/.asdf/plugins/nodejs/shims/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 114.0.5735.198\r\n    Edge: 113.0.1774.57\r\n    Firefox: 103.0.2\r\n    Firefox Developer Edition: 114.0\r\n    Safari: 16.5.1\r\n    Safari Technology Preview: 17.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^2.0.0 => 2.1.0 \r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-static: ^2.0.2 => 2.0.2 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.22.1 => 1.22.1 \r\n    svelte: ^4.0.0 => 4.0.5 \r\n    vite: ^4.3.6 => 4.4.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nblocking an upgrade\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10358/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10358/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
