Just a failing test for now (have to run, will implement later if time allows).~~\r\n\r\nBasic strategy:\r\n\r\n* Track, in `load_server_data`, what gets used (`url`, `params.foo`, `parent`)\r\n* Send that information to the client alongside `data`\r\n* On navigation, when requesting `__data.json`, specify (probably in a custom header) which nodes have been invalidated (i.e. if a node uses `url`, it will always be invalid if the URL has changed; if it uses `params.foo`, it is only invalid if `params.foo` has changed; if it uses `parent` then it will be invalid if any parent is invalid)\r\n* On the server, only run the invalid nodes, return a value like `-1` for everything that remains valid. If an invalid node _unexpectedly_ calls `await parent`, run everything upstream as well\r\n* On the server, fill in the `-1` values from memory\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6056/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":6,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6056/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1229443709","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6349#issuecomment-1229443709","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6349","id":1229443709,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5JR9J9","user":{"login":"bjon","id":280413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDQxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon","html_url":"https://github.com/bjon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-28T12:09:25Z","updated_at":"2022-08-28T12:09:25Z","body":"I

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6352/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6352/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-28T17:45:55Z","updated_at":"2022-08-28T17:45:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6353","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6353/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6353/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6353/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6353","id":1353418736,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c5Qq4fw","number":6353,"title":"Load

Describe the bug\n\nDuring my work of the (simple) demo of PR #6265, I have found that the \"TODO\" items \"get stuck\" in the cache in IE11, after the demo invalidation.\r\nAfter digging into Kit's code, I found out that the \"dumb\" IE11 ignore the request headers (specifically, \"x-sveltekit-invalidated\") if it hit the cache, so this is why it's less likely to hit this issue on other browsers.\r\n\r\nI must have been explaining the issue terribley now, so I'll just explain what is wrong with Kit's code. In:\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/05e8240150da446f6cd3c1f0feb4447408b2b43b/packages/kit/src/runtime/client/client.js#L716-L725\r\nit's possible that the browser will use the cache, in the rare case that the header 'x-sveltekit-invalidated' matched to a cached request (or in the case we're on IE11 which probably ignores headers on caching), although clearly this target has been marked as invalid and must not be cached.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nAdd `cache: 'no-cache'` as a parameter to `native_fetch`. This means that the browser will always query the server and check for the server response (even if it have cache), but allow the browser to cache the updated response for later. ([Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/cache#value))\r\nI'll upload PR soon.\r\n\r\nMight be the root reason for the failure of #6354 and #6349 .\n\n### Reproduction\n\nUse the simple demo I mentioned on PR #6265.\r\nYou'll notice the wrong caching behavior while trying to add/remove items in the TODO list.\r\nAfter changing Kit's code at the place I mentioned, it works.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.19044\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz\r\n    Memory: 2.92 GB / 15.49

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nExpected: When calling `invalidate()`, the `load()` function will run for both `+page.server.js` and `+layout.server.js` endpoints.\r\n\r\nActual: When calling `invalidate()`, the `load()` function does not run for \r\n `+layout.server.js` endpoints.\r\n\r\nWas working in 1.0.0-next.443, now broken for versions >= 1.0.0-next.444.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSee below minimal repo that reproduces the bug, by having one counter on +page.server.js, and another counter in a `+layout.server.js` file.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/oscarhermoso/layout-invalidate-bug\r\n\r\nOn page refresh, both counters increment as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you click the button to call `invalidate()`, only the `+page.server.js` counter increments.\r\n\r\nInstall previous svelte-kit version with `npm i @sveltejs/kit@1.0.0-next.443` to see previous behaviour working as expected.\r\n\r\n###
