happy.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1435751412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sureshjoshi","id":3823045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjMwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3823045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshjoshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1435753121","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/9114#issuecomment-1435753121","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9114","id":1435753121,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5Vk9qh","user":{"login":"ghostdevv","id":47755378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NzU1Mzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47755378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostdevv","html_url":"https://github.com/ghostdevv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostdevv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostdevv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostdevv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostdevv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostdevv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostdevv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostdevv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostdevv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghostdevv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-18T19:35:38Z","updated_at":"2023-02-18T19:35:38Z","body":"The

It's explained in the linked PR's docs which are hopefully up on the main Kit site soon. The `Button.svelte` example in this issue would be written as follows:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"typesVersions\": {\r\n    \">4.0\": {\r\n      \"Button.svelte\": [\"./dist/Button.svelte.d.ts\"]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`svelte-migrate` will be updated to migrate this automatically, so it's probably easiest to run the migration script again on your libraries to get the `typesVersions` addition to your `package.json`, copy it out, revert the rest, copy it back in.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1437345035/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8564019952,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5ezAAIzwAAAAH-dJLw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8564019952","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-20T17:53:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8564019991,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5ezAAIzwAAAAH-dJMX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8564019991","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"196dfd3ba63fe5a5d8ff94959ced92a84297cbd9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/196dfd3ba63fe5a5d8ff94959ced92a84297cbd9","created_at":"2023-02-20T17:53:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1437836930","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/9114#issuecomment-1437836930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9114","id":1437836930,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5Vs6aC","user":{"login":"sureshjoshi","id":3823045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjMwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3823045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshjoshi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshjoshi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/user
