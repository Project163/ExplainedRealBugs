Browsers seem to cache fairly aggressively when duplicating tabs. If the request does make it to SvelteKit, then it will render either the page or endpoint according to the `Accept` header - per https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#server-content-negotiation. So if you want your endpoint's response to be cached not only by URL (which is the same as your page) but also by the `Accept` header currently being used to request it, you can specify the `Vary: Accept` header in your response if you don't want to forego caching altogether. I don't know that there's anything SvelteKit could reasonably do here.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1525359800/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Conduitry","id":16696352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njk2MzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16696352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry","html_url":"https://github.com/Conduitry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1525386135","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/9780#issuecomment-1525386135","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9780","id":1525386135,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5a64uX","user":{"login":"oscarhermoso","id":23239955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjM5OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23239955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscarhermoso","html_url":"https://github.com/oscarhermoso","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscarhermoso/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscarhermoso/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscarhermoso/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscarhermoso/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscarhermoso/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscarhermoso/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscarhermoso/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscarhermoso/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oscarhermoso/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-27T10:19:37Z","updated_at":"2023-04-27T10:30:16Z","body":"@Conduitry - Very nice, the `Vary: Accept` header resolves the issue and is definitely a better solution than `'Cache-Control': 'No-Store'`.

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`.
