But `vitest` runs fine. It seems to work if I add an includes in the project `tsconfig.json` to \r\n\r\n```\r\n\"include\": [\r\n    \"./.svelte-kit/ambient.d.ts\",\r\n    \"src/**/*.js\",\r\n    \"src/**/*.ts\",\r\n    \"src/**/*.svelte\",\r\n    \"src/**/*.js\",\r\n    \"src/**/*.ts\",\r\n    \"src/**/*.svelte\",\r\n    \"test/**/*.ts\",\r\n    \"test/**/*.js\",\r\n    \"test/**/*.svelte\"\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nand relaunch VS Code. But I'm wondering why test directory wasn't included in .`svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` in the first place.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-08-05 at 14 59 39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1709986/183082642-33821a9d-f135-443b-b6e3-86e0cf8daa12.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/manuganji/sjsf/tree/17b0742b3d25347a6c4be2186a7bd8f568ea32ae\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.1\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Apple M1\r\n    Memory: 30.89 MB / 8.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.14.2/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.17 - /opt/homebrew/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.10.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.14.2/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 104.0.5112.79\r\n    Firefox: 100.0.2\r\n    Safari: 15.2\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.63 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.403 \r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.49.0 \r\n    vite: ^3.0.0 => 3.0.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5833/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
