Describe the bug\r\n\r\nCalling `throw redirect(code, path)` throws a `Redirect` object. (In JavaScript, anything can be thrown, it doesn't have to be an `Error`)\r\n\r\nWhen SvelteKit catches a thrown object, it tries to deterimne whether the thrown object is a `Redirect` object (in which case it converts it to a `Response`). Otherwise it is handled as an error.\r\n\r\nSvelteKit uses `error instanceof Redirect` in a few places to make this check.\r\n\r\nThis works fine if there is only one implementation of `Redirect`, but there might actually be more than one. In that case, the `instanceof` check will return `false`, treating a redirect as an error.\r\n\r\nSo why are there more than two implementations of `Redirect`? I searched for \"grotesque\" to find out 😄 .\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/c9d271130b865c7f102052570a61ceb2d1ac9bca/packages/kit/src/runtime/control.js#L47-L63\r\n\r\nIn other words, `replace_implementations` causes `error instanceof Redirect` to always return `false`.\r\nThis is what breaks the `redirect` behaviour.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how best to fix this. Perhaps by replacing `error instanceof Redirect` with `isRedirect(error)`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction isRedirect(object) {\r\n    return 'status' in object && \r\n           'location' in object && \r\n           typeof object.status === 'number' && \r\n           typeof object.location === 'string'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you think this is a good solution I'd be happy to submit a PR.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nI'm sorry, I haven't prepared one. But [many people seem to have a problem with this on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/457912077277855764/1065392650229927986).\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 13.0.1\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7920HQ CPU @ 3.10GHz\r\n    Memory: 1.49 GB / 16.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.18.1 - ~/.asdf/installs/nodejs/16.18.1/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.19.2 - ~/.asdf/plugins/nodejs/shims/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 109.0.5414.87\r\n    Firefox: 108.0.2\r\n    Safari: 16.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare: 1.0.4 => 1.0.4\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.0.13 => 1.0.13\r\n    svelte: 3.55.1 => 3.55.1\r\n    vite: 4.0.4 => 4.0.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nblocking all usage of SvelteKit\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI've tried `@sveltejs/kit` versions between `1.0.10` and `1.1.4`, and they all seem to have the bug.\r\n\r\nBecause the bug has only surfaced in the past 24h or so (I think), it is probably triggered by a dependency that has moved underneath.
