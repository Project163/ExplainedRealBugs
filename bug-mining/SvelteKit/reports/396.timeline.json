Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9795/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9795/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9122349753,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5knV0rzwAAAAIfvAK5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/9122349753","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-28T08:30:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9122349863,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5knV0rzwAAAAIfvAMn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/9122349863","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d597ba8dcf6ac5096ac93d98be5eca30b69fd18e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/d597ba8dcf6ac5096ac93d98be5eca30b69fd18e","created_at":"2023-04-28T08:30:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"gtm-nayan","id":50981692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTgxNjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50981692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan","html_url":"https://github.com/gtm-nayan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-29T17:28:13Z","updated_at":"2023-04-29T17:28:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9804","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9804/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9804/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9804/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/9804","id":1689610683,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c5ktWm7","number":9804,"title":"SvelteKit
