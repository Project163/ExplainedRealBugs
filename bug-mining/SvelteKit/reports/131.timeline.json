also added a `+layout.ts` and everything lit up.  Thanks for the lead, @charbelnicolas.\r\n\r\nThe takeaways from this issue:\r\n1) the docs need to be updated in 2 places.\r\n2) in the error case, the resulting error message needs improvement\r\n\r\n### Document update suggestions\r\nLocation: https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options#prerender\r\n> Alternatively, you can set export const prerender = true in your root +layout and prerender everything except pages that are explicitly marked as not prerenderable:\r\n\r\nI read that multiple times and it never dawned on me that it was the script file instead of the .svelte file.  Simple fix is adding the extension to +layout`.js`\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation: https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#prerender\r\n> default — set to true to prerender encountered pages not containing export const prerender = false\r\n\r\nThis is no longer true and should be removed.\r\n\r\nOf all the breaking changes in the past few weeks, this change really doesn't sit well with me because instead of allowing me to globally specify a behavior and then selectively modifying the behavior, I'm forced to micro-manage the behavior. With large sites that may use a large number of N layouts, this change forces the creation N extra files -- all of which say the same thing (and there is just more clutter to +server.js files). Please consider allowing a global default to exist.\r\n\r\n### Error message suggestion\r\n> Try adding `export const prerender = true` to your root layout\r\n\r\nIt would be a good idea to add the .js extension to the error message.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering our sites didn't previously require +layout.ts files, the documentation and error message's generalized references to `+layout` and `root layout` led me to believe the fix was updating the `+layout.svelte`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1236432977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mprather","id":25933462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTMzNDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25933462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather","html_url":"https://github.com/mprather","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7319051324,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c5RGq8uzwAAAAG0P9w8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7319051324","actor":{"login":"charbelnicolas","id":14960414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTYwNDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14960414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas","html_url":"https://github.com/charbelnicolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-04T23:13:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7319051326,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5RGq8uzwAAAAG0P9w-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7319051326","actor":{"login":"charbelnicolas","id":14960414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTYwNDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14960414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas","html_url":"https://github.com/charbelnicolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-04T23:13:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1236434549","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6538#issuecomment-1236434549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6538","id":1236434549,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5Jsn51","user":{"login":"charbelnicolas","id":14960414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTYwNDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14960414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas","html_url":"https://github.com/charbelnicolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charbelnicolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/charb

With large sites that may use a large number of N layouts, this change forces the creation N extra files -- all of which say the same thing (and there is just more clutter to +server.js files). Please consider allowing a global default to exist.\r\n\r\nWe replaced one way of specifying a global default (`config.kit.prerender.default`) with another (setting `prerender` in your root layout). This is much more flexible since you can also set it in individual layouts to control entire subtrees. So no, this doesn't force the creation of N extra files, it forces the creation of _one_ extra file (or zero, if you already have a root `+layout.js`) and allows you to _delete_ per-page overrides in favour of per-layout overrides, which are likely to be vastly fewer in number.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1236885473/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1237533038","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6538#issuecomment-1237533038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6538","id":1237533038,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5Jw0Fu","user":{"login":"mprather","id":25933462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTMzNDYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25933462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather","html_url":"https://github.com/mprather","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mprather/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-05T23:57:59Z","updated_at":"2022-09-05T23:57:59Z","body":"The assumption that all sites will have a root layout doesn't hold for everyone.  Even with the 2 sites we have under development, we've had to go through and add multiple files and update quite a few +server files.  \r\n\r\nI don't consider our projects to be complex or elaborate; deciding to save for more complex sites after we learned how to better use svelte (my team decided to start using svelte-kit back in June).  I fully expect on some of the more elaborate sites, we would have a large number of layouts all requiring this bit of customization (i.e. add another file), but none really relying on a root level layout.\r\n\r\nA global setting was very nice. It was simple.  This change moved away from simple. \r\n\r\nPrerender should be settable in the config file with the opportunity to override as needed.  Why can't we have both a global setting and improved per-layout mechanism? \r\n\r\nIf you want simple, use the config setting. Why in the world do I want to *repeatedly* state that I want to prerender when I know the entire project is supposed to have the same characteristic?  In the small site (< 15 total pages) where we first ran into this issue, we've had to state this fact no less than 4 times (2 layouts, 2 server files). This is not efficient or simple. Before the change, the fact was stated once. I could look at the config file, see that the project is set to use the static adapter and prerender was set to true. Simple. \r\n\r\nIf you want to be more granular, then use +layout.js and +server.js files. \r\n\r\nFor the foreseeable future (for our current and anticipated projects), this change adds clutter.
