I have an a tag with the download attribute which shouldn't route, but after clicking it still fires the `beforeNavigate` This download is technically external and it causes the url to not maintain the query params in the url. I also tried adding data-sveltekit-reload to the a tag and still got the same results. It didn't appear to work. This is a confirmed issue on my local machine.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n[Stackblitz Reproduction](https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-jsjmtj?file=src%2Froutes%2F%2Blayout.svelte&terminal=dev)\r\n\r\nSveltekit maintains the params in the search bar, but not in sveltekit itself. Most of what you're looking for will be in the console under $page.url.search\r\n\r\n1. Ensure the is a query param of `appKey=12345`\r\n2. Click around the 2 pages and you can see that it maintains the query params in the console from `$page.url.search`\r\n3. after clicking the PDF download button it downloads the pdf and then runs the `beforeNavigate` function (This is when I would expect it not to navigate)\r\n4. Clicking to another page will not maintain query params in `$page.url.search` as the got wiped away from the faulty navigate.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.19044\r\n    CPU: (16) x64 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-11800H @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 33.15 GB / 63.73 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.13.1 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    npm: 8.1.2 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Edge: Spartan (44.19041.1266.0), Chromium (110.0.1587.50)\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.19041.1566\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.91\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: 1.0.0 => 1.0.0\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.5.0 => 1.5.0\r\n    svelte: ^3.54.0 => 3.55.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nserious, but I can work around it\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis has been tested locally and on stackblitz.
