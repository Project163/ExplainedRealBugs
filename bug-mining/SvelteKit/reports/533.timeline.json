https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/13546\r\n\r\nThis PR changes server nodes from always loading dynamically imported component's styles and fonts to only loading them if they are used during SSR (to avoid FOUC). This fixes lazy loading of components on the client, only retrieving the styles when needed.\r\n\r\nWe can tell which deps are used during SSR by analysing the deps of the node with both the server manifest and the client manifest, then comparing the results. If a style or font is missing from the server deps, it's probably only used on the client. Therefore, it should be safe to load lazily.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be

Describe the problem\r\n\r\nWhen using dynamically imported components as suggested in this [thread](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/9775#issuecomment-1526147626), css of all dynamically imported components is loaded.\r\n\r\nHere's [a link to the example repo](https://github.com/sviripa/sveltekit-dynamic-imports-example) and [here it is deployed](https://sveltekit-dynamic-imports-example.vercel.app/foo). On `Foo` page it renders two components so it is ok to load css bundles of all dynamically imported components. On `Bar` and `Baz` only one of the components is rendered but both css bundles are loaded. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nI recognize that for the majority setups loading all css upfront is desired. Thus, I would like to propose a solution that does not change the default behaviour of SvelteKit and instead extends its api to give users a bit more control over css loading. \r\n\r\nI suggest to add an additional function to `handle` server hook, similar to `preload`, that would be used to determine what files to should be loaded on the page. Example:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nexport async function handle({ event, resolve }) {\r\n\tconst response = await resolve(event, {\r\n\t\tload: ({ type, path }) => type === 'css' || path.includes('/important/')\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\treturn response;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI implemented [a draft PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/12677) for this functionality and would be happy to continue working on it if the suggested solution makes sense to SvelteKit's maintainers.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\ni cannot use SvelteKit without it\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12709/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12709/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17259785923,"node_id":"UADE_lADOEiPr8c6svxhfzwAAAAQEw27D","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/17259785923","actor":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unmarked_as_duplicate","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-15T02:57:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
