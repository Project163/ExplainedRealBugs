For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13522/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13522/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16525684331,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c6sIaF5zwAAAAPZAe5r","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/16525684331","actor":{"login":"max-lt","id":9805205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MDUyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9805205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-lt","html_url":"https://github.com/max-lt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-lt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-lt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-lt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-lt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-lt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-lt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-lt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-lt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-lt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-02T17:56:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16544400998,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOEiPr8c6sIaF5zwAAAAPaH4Zm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/16544400998","actor":{"login":"elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github","id":76245373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1Mzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76245373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github","html_url":"https://github.com/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-04T04:35:26Z","label":{"name":"pkg:adapter-vercel","color":"33818A"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16544401000,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c6sIaF5zwAAAAPaH4Zo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/16544401000","actor":{"login":"elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github","id":76245373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MjQ1Mzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76245373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github","html_url":"https://github.com/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-04T04:35:26Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16544401449,"node_id":"ITAE_lADOEiPr8c6sIaF5zwAAAAPaH4gp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/16544401449","actor":{"login":"elliott-with-the-longest-name-on-github","id":76245373,"nod
