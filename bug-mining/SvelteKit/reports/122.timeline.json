actually didn't know about this event. What I ended up doing in an app (something going back to when it was using Sapper) in e2e tests when I wanted to make sure the app was running and hydrated before proceeding was to have `onMount(() => document.body.setAttribute('hydrated', ''))` in my root layout and then just wait for that attribute to be present in the tests.
