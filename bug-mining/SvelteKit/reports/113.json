It's fast, and doesn't involve a deserialization step. (It doesn't currently support [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) though, we'd need to add that.)\r\n\r\nTo work with CSP, we can't `eval` the result (including by creating a `<script>`), we need to `import` it. Since we need to get fresh data when navigating back to a previously-visited page, we need to use a cachebusting mechanism; since modules live in a cache that we have no way of purging, we need to be careful to avoid memory leaks.\r\n\r\nWe can't therefore do this...\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const data = {...};\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and must instead do this, so that the data can be garbage collected once it's been used:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nwindow.__data = {...};\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the client side, it would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet uid = 1;\r\n\r\n// later\r\nawait import(`${url.pathname}/__data.js`);\r\nconst data = window.__data;\r\ndelete window.__data;\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThere's a variety of alternatives to devalue listed here: https://github.com/rich-harris/devalue#see-also, though I'm not aware of any reasons to favour them.\r\n\r\nOr, we could just stick to JSON, which has [better performance characteristics](https://v8.dev/blog/cost-of-javascript-2019#json) if you have a huge amount of data.\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6008/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6008/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
