However, the bug causes the history object to be pushed even when the `data-sveltekit-replacestate` attribute is used, resulting in unexpected navigation history behavior.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-jsaxq9\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new SvelteKit project or open an existing one\r\n2. Add a hash link with the `data-sveltekit-replacestate` attribute, like the following: `<a data-sveltekit-replacestate href=\"#c\">c</a>`\r\n3. Start the development server and navigate to the page containing the hash link\r\n4. Click on the link with the attribute\r\n5. Observe the URL change and the browser's navigation history\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nNot applicable\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9546/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
