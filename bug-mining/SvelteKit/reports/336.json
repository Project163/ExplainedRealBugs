Commenting the `register` action clears the errors.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.10 Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS (Focal Fossa)\r\n    CPU: (6) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8600K CPU @ 3.60GHz\r\n    Memory: 46.58 GB / 50.16 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.0.17 - /bin/bash\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 19.2.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v19.2.0/bin/node\r\n    npm: 9.2.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v19.2.0/bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^1.0.0 => 1.0.2\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.0.0 => 1.3.10\r\n    svelte: ^3.54.0 => 3.55.1\r\n    vite: ^4.0.0 => 4.1.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8865/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
