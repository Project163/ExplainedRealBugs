Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9349/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8696493146,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5e841MzwAAAAIGWfRa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8696493146","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-08T13:24:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8696493506,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5e841MzwAAAAIGWfXC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8696493506","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"daad7e48b175245cbb7efd0e255263bfb52a5ee6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/daad7e48b175245cbb7efd0e255263bfb52a5ee6","created_at":"2023-03-08T13:24:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"migbash","id":20924663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTI0NjYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20924663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/migbash","html_url":"https://github.com/migbash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migbash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migbash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migbash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migbash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migbash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migbash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migbash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migbash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migbash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-26T08:08:14Z","updated_at":"2023-04-26T08:08:14Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Betarena/scores/issues/1231","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Betarena/scores","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Betarena/scores/issues/1231/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Betarena/scores/issues/1231/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Betarena/scores/issues/1231/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Betarena/scores/issues/1231","id":1678301777,"node_id":"I_kwDOGZgu6c5kCNpR","number":1231,"title":"🔥

one of them of high severity is the inability to get correctly indexed, making the platform lose 90% of its traffic.\n\nError on Google:\n\n![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37311649/233615807-8daf202c-0186-4f4b-9bb5-28d1801d845d.png)\n\nThe page is not usable on mobile devices.\n\n`Uncaught (in promise) Error: Rejected at wrsParams.serviceWorkers.navigator.serviceWorker.register (<anonymous>:13:648) at https://scores.betarena.com/pt/futebol/hellas-verona-bologna-18548086:59:30`\n\n🔍 Steps to Reproduce:\n\nUse the search console and add any fixture link.\n\nAlso, if a search is made on Google:\n\n\"site:scores.betarena.com\" is possible to see that the number of pages indexed in the last 24 hours is very low.\n\n🤔 Expected Behavior:\n\nThere must be no message stating the pages cannot be used on mobile. Also, the preview should be the mobile view. Besides, the number of indexed pages must be much higher.\n\n💥 Actual Behavior:\n\nLots of pages are not being indexed, and errors on the Search console.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Betarena/scores/issues/1231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Betarena/scores/issues/1231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
