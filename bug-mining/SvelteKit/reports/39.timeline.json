Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\nBacking issue: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4929\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\nRan `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check` on `create-svelte` package. Script `test` does not exist there. Tested app locally by deleting `userid` cookie then reloading the page and verifying the cookie was recreated with a new random UUID.

What happens when the app is deployed with an adapter to an environment that doesn't have the Node runtime available?\r\n\r\nThanks. I tried a Pages build after I saw your comment and your intuition was right. The build fails with a reference error as `crypto` import can't be used in the worker as, in the worker context, it's a global. And we can't currently remove the import in the hooks file (despite valid syntax) as `crypto` isn't available in the global namespace during the kit

Thanks. I tried a Pages build after I saw your comment and your intuition was right. The build fails with a reference error as `crypto` import can't be used in the worker as, in the worker context, it's a global. And we can't currently remove the import in the hooks file (despite valid syntax) as `crypto` isn't available in the global namespace during the kit build.\r\n\r\nthis is an issue i currently face on my own site, but i have this hack in my svelte config\r\n```ts\r\nimport { webcrypto } from 'crypto';\r\nglobal.crypto = webcrypto;\r\n```\r\n(this works because the config is run only in node environments, and during dev and build its all sharing that global scope)\r\n\r\nwe obviously shouldn't throw this in the demo, but it's fine as a temp fix for other projects.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1127164061/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"paperclover","id":24465214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDY1MjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24465214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover","html_url":"https://github.com/paperclover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6626980112,"node_id":"MIE_lADOEiPr8c5JrxoKzwAAAAGK_7EQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6626980112","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-17T19:13:40Z","milestone":{"title":"1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6626980829,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c5JrxoKzwAAAAGK_7Pd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6626980829","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-17T19:13:48Z","label":{"name":"low
