Describe the bug\n\nDuring my work of the (simple) demo of PR #6265, I have found that the \"TODO\" items \"get stuck\" in the cache in IE11, after the demo invalidation.\r\nAfter digging into Kit's code, I found out that the \"dumb\" IE11 ignore the request headers (specifically, \"x-sveltekit-invalidated\") if it hit the cache, so this is why it's less likely to hit this issue on other browsers.\r\n\r\nI must have been explaining the issue terribley now, so I'll just explain what is wrong with Kit's code. In:\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/05e8240150da446f6cd3c1f0feb4447408b2b43b/packages/kit/src/runtime/client/client.js#L716-L725\r\nit's possible that the browser will use the cache, in the rare case that the header 'x-sveltekit-invalidated' matched to a cached request (or in the case we're on IE11 which probably ignores headers on caching), although clearly this target has been marked as invalid and must not be cached.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nAdd `cache: 'no-cache'` as a parameter to `native_fetch`. This means that the browser will always query the server and check for the server response (even if it have cache), but allow the browser to cache the updated response for later. ([Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/cache#value))\r\nI'll upload PR soon.\r\n\r\nMight be the root reason for the failure of #6354 and #6349 .\n\n### Reproduction\n\nUse the simple demo I mentioned on PR #6265.\r\nYou'll notice the wrong caching behavior while trying to add/remove items in the TODO list.\r\nAfter changing Kit's code at the place I mentioned, it works.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.19044\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz\r\n    Memory: 2.92 GB / 15.49

The `invalidate`/`depends` function expects an URL / constructs one, so in this case `depends('user')` becomes `http://127.0.0.1:5173/user`, but `invalidate('user')` inside `foo` becomes `http://127.0.0.1:5173/foo/user` - this doesn't match, so nothing reruns.\r\nI've been bitten by this, too, since I wasn't aware of it, and while the docs [hint at it](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#input-methods-depends), they don't make it very explicit. So we should at least enhance the docs, or allow arbitrary values for `depends` and `invalidate` - but not sure how to do this in a way that also preserves existing behavior. @Rich-Harris FYI marking

However the requirements of invalidating completely custom identifiers and urls don't mix well. For urls passed to `fetch` or `depends` one would like to resolve the full url from relative paths but custom identifiers should stay unaltered. The implementation and usage of this would be quite ugly because there we would need a way to differentiate between the \"url\" variant and the \"custom\" variant either by providing a flag or having separate functions for each variant.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```ts\r\nfunction depends(identifier: string, isCustom?: boolean){}\r\nfunction invalidate(identifier: string, isCustom?: boolean){}\r\n```\r\nThis is of cause not very nice.\r\n\r\nSo I was quite happy when I came up with the solution described in my [previous comment](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6354#issuecomment-1230739703) because it unifies the requirements of urls and custom identifiers. Of cause this does not give you complete freedom over what identifiers you can choose because of the (protocol like) prefix but it's close enough in my daily work. And being forced to use a prefix for custom identifiers makes it quite trivial to define namespaces/categories for them that are easily invalidated with a predicate. \r\n\r\nLong story short: There is no need for another breaking change in this case IMO.

A better approach, which happens to be clearer and easier to document, is to create a new `invalidateAll` function:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n<script>\r\n-  import { invalidate } from '$app/navigation';\r\n+  import { invalidateAll } from '$app/navigation';\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n-<button on:click={() => invalidate()}>reload</button>\r\n+<button on:click={() => invalidateAll()}>reload</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeparately, I think it's probably more useful if the predicate form takes a `URL` instead of a string:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-invalidate((dep) => dep.includes('/some/matched/pathname'));\r\n+invalidate((url) => url.pathname.startsWith('/some/matched/pathname'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this second part is the sort of breaking change that's basically impossible to add a runtime error for. If people think a string (i.e. `url.href`) is preferable, then we could keep it as it is.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6493/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6493/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7303131850,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5Qq5lZzwAAAAGzTPLK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7303131850","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-01T08:53:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7303131912,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5Qq5lZzwAAAAGzTPMI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7303131912","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"db51d1296febf5537f6f745fcb1afd04d49188bd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/db51d1296febf5537f6f745fcb1afd04d49188bd","created_at":"2022-09-01T08:53:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1684083288","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6354#issuecomment-1684083288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6354","id":1684083288,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5kYRJY","user":{"login":"cassepipe","id":42150430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTUwNDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42150430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassepipe","html_url":"https://github.com/cassepipe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassepipe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassepipe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassepipe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassepipe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassepipe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassepipe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassepipe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassepipe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cassepipe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-18T15:28:05Z","updated_at":"2023-09-27T10:53:02Z","body":"EDIT:
