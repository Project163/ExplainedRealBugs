I created an [issue in the svelte repo](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/13481) for it, but it obviously belongs here in the kit repo.\r\n\r\nJust posting the relevant details here, as it is the exact same issue as the OP is describing.\r\n\r\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWhen destructuring a function out of a function argument, for example like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// `resolve` is a function that is destructured out of the function argument\r\nasync function handle({ event, resolve }) {\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nESLint yells at me:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror  Avoid referencing unbound methods which may cause unintentional scoping of `this`.\r\nIf your function does not access `this`, you can annotate it with `this: void`, or consider using an arrow function instead  @typescript-eslint/unbound-method\r\n```\r\n\r\nDestructuing the function argument is very common, and is the way it's done in both the [Docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/hooks#server-hooks-handle) and [Tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/handle) for the handle hook.\r\n\r\nI don't think `resolve` uses `this`, so I think the issue would be solved by declaring `Handle` like this (using arrow function for `resolve`):\r\n```ts\r\nexport type Handle = (input: {\r\n  event: RequestEvent;\r\n  resolve: (event: RequestEvent, opts?: ResolveOptions) => MaybePromise<Response>;\r\n}) => MaybePromise<Response>;\r\n```\r\n\r\n or this (annotating `resolve` with `this: void`): \r\n```ts\r\nexport type Handle = (input: {\r\n  event: RequestEvent;\r\n  resolve(this: void, event: RequestEvent, opts?: ResolveOptions): MaybePromise<Response>;\r\n}) => MaybePromise<Response>;\r\n```\r\n\r\ninstead of this (`resolve` is a regular function):\r\n```ts\r\nexport type Handle = (input: {\r\n  event: RequestEvent;\r\n  resolve(event: RequestEvent, opts?: ResolveOptions): MaybePromise<Response>;\r\n}) => MaybePromise<Response>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: The same issue applies to some other functions. At least `parent` in `LayoutLoad` and `PageLoad` comes to mind.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nSet up SvelteKit with ESLint and [`@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked`](https://typescript-eslint.io/users/configs#recommended-type-checked).\r\n\r\nSet up a handle hook:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// src/hooks.server.js\r\nimport type { Handle } from \"@sveltejs/kit\";\r\n\r\nexport const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {\r\n  return await resolve(event);\r\n}\r\n```","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/2428315716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Stadly","id":7263579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNjM1Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7263579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stadly","html_url":"https://github.com/Stadly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stadly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stadly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stadly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stadly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stadly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stadly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stadly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stadly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stadly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14779099339,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c6Ud38wzwAAAANw5yjL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/14779099339","actor":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-22T07:22:55Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14779104262,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c6Ud38wzwAAAANw5zwG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/14779104262","actor":{"login":"teemingc","id":54401897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDAxODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54401897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc","html_url":"https://github.com/teemingc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teemingc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-22T07:23:17Z","label":{"name":"types

the [ESLint `@typescript-eslint/unbound-method-error` rule][1] and fix/ignore all the errors it throws at us.\r\n\r\nBasically, this rule warns us from unbinding a function (e.g. doing `const {x} = {x() { /* etc */}}` that doesn't explicitly have `this: void`.\r\n\r\nI've replaced these types with arrow functions when possible, to avoid users of the SvelteKit library from facing the same ESLint issues.\r\n\r\nThere are some instances where ESLint throws an error when we are purposely doing this (e.g. we'd later call `func.apply(originalThis,` or `func.call(originalThis,`, but since they're rare, I've just added ``// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/unbound-method -- We'll pass `xxxxx` as `this` `` comments there to ignore the error.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/b84e4dc8117b6ce90c6ee8eeb3f3e08151a251b6/packages/kit/src/runtime/client/client.js#L91-L95\r\n\r\nI've also manually fixed some types in `packages/kit/src/exports/public.d.ts` that weren't caught by the `@typescript-eslint/unbound-method-error` rule, since they're only destructured in `packages/kit/test/apps`, which is ignored by our ESLint config. However, this manual change should fix https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/12622.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/unbound-method/\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Your PR description here -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n  - Fixes https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/12622 for me, but since the `@typescript-eslint/*` rules ignore `packages/kit/test/apps/**`, it's possible that I've missed some issues. \r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n  - ESLint fails before most of these changes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n  - The changes in the `packages/package` should be internal only, so we don't need to make a changeset for it.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12915/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12915/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"aloisklink","id":19716675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzE2Njc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19716675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloisklink","html_url":"https://github.com/aloisklink","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloisklink/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloisklink/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloisklink/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloisklink/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloisklink/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloisklink/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloisklink/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloisklink/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloisklink/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-05T05:36:04Z","updated_at":"2024-11-05T05:36:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12955","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12955/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12955/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12955/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/12955","id":2634469239,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c6A4cB9","number":12955,"title":"fix:

class method function types causes SvelteKit users to get TypeScript ESLint errors if they're using the [@typescript-eslint/unbound-method][1] rule (included by default in the `recommended-type-checked` config).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/home/projects/stackblitz-starters-1y7qpk/src/routes/sum/+layout.ts\r\n  3:42  error  Avoid referencing unbound methods which may cause unintentional scoping of `this`.\r\nIf your function does not access `this`, you can annotate it with `this: void`, or consider using an arrow function instead  @typescript-eslint/unbound-method\r\n```\r\n\r\nSwitching SvelteKit's public types to arrow functions fixes https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/12622.\r\n\r\n### Implementation decisions\r\n\r\nI haven't enabled the `@typescript-eslint/unbound-method` rule in this PR. However, I've got a separate PR (https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/12915) where we enable this rule and we fix internal types as well.\r\n\r\nI kept the following types in `public.d.ts` using non-arrow functions, since:\r\n\r\n- These types are for user inputs, which might rely on these functions being bound, and so it might be a breaking change to change these types:\r\n  - [`Emulator['platform']`][2]\r\n  - functions in `KitConfig`\r\n- Class methods that rely on `this`:\r\n  - [`Server`][3]\r\n\r\nI also had to make some changes to `packages/kit/src/runtime/server/cookie.js` to make TypeScript happy.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/unbound-method/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/b25f2d052bbf22e832ac57cbf9e12c48ac922f96/packages/kit/src/exports/public.d.ts#L272-L276\r\n[3]: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/b25f2d052bbf22e832ac57cbf9e12c48ac922f96/packages/kit/src/exports/public.d.ts#L1174-L1178\r\n\r\n<!-- Your PR description here -->\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n  - Fixes https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/12622\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n  - No tests, however https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/12915 enables the [@typescript-eslint/unbound-method][1] rule as well and does test this.\r\n    However, I've split it up on the advice of @benmccann (see https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/12915#issuecomment-2455481039)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12955/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12955/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15943082545,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c6Ud38wzwAAAAO2SCIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/15943082545","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-15T15:45:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15943082561,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c6Ud38wzwAAAAO2SCJB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/15943082561","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"e2a4538c48295cde06f64fb8c7f0b333fbf95496","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/e2a4538c48295cde06f64fb8c7f0b333fbf95496","created_at":"2025-01-15T15:45:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
