The Problem\r\n\r\nFixes #12081 (and _maybe_ helps with #3850).\r\n\r\nTL;DR:\r\n```js\r\n// +server.ts\r\nimport asset from \"$lib/image.png\";\r\n\r\nexport const GET = async ({ fetch }) => { return fetch(asset); };\r\n```\r\n\r\nworks in dev and preview, but always returns [`404`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/df6641a701f8155d7023ab6a5b17ef39df31d730/packages/kit/src/runtime/server/respond.js#L118-L120) with adapter-cloudflare and adapter-node.\r\n\r\nMore details and exhaustive reproduction in #12081 and [here](https://github.com/mastermakrela/sveltekit-relative-assets-fetch-bug)\r\n\r\n## The Solution\r\n\r\nI've extended all places that check `manifest.assets` to also check `manifest._.server_assets`. \r\nThis has two benefits:\r\n\r\n1. the adapters can return the file directly without calling the SvelteKit server\r\n2. `server_fetch` (in `packages/kit/src/runtime/server/fetch.js`) can return the file earlier (previously it fell through to [`response`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/df6641a701f8155d7023ab6a5b17ef39df31d730/packages/kit/src/runtime/server/fetch.js#L127))\r\n\r\nThis should always work because since #11649 all server assets should be copied to the output folder ([source](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/10594#issuecomment-1901430103)).\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\nIf [`read`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$app-server-read) implementation is available, `server_fetch` will use it to get the files directly — should be theoretically faster than a fetch.\r\n\r\nThis PR is similar to what #3850 proposed, but because `state.read`/`options.read` expects a function that returns a buffer and `read_implementation` returns a stream, they aren't compatible. Also, it still wouldn't work with Cloudflare, because there the “file read” is an async fetch.\r\n\r\nBut this PR brings us as close as possible to #3850 as currently possible, because:\r\n- node will use [`read`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$app-server-read) — skips overhead of fetch\r\n- Cloudflare will fetch static asset directly\r\n\r\nand both of them (and maybe more adapters that I didn't test) will work with relative paths on the server.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`.
