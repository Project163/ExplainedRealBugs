Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI've come to the view that `stuff` (as it's currently designed) is a mistake, because it forces nested routes to load serially and because it prevents us from taking advantage of nested routes to stream responses (see #4910).\r\n\r\nIdeally if we had a route like this...\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<!-- src/routes/__layout.svelte -->\r\n<script context=\"module\">\r\n  export async function load({ fetch }) {\r\n    const res = await fetch('/one.json');\r\n    const { one } = await res.json();\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n      props: { one }\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n  export let one;\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<h1>{one}</h1>\r\n<div>\r\n  <slot/>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<!-- src/routes/foo/__layout.svelte -->\r\n<script context=\"module\">\r\n  export async function load({ fetch }) {\r\n    const res = await fetch('/two.json');\r\n    const { two } = await res.json();\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n      props: { two }\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n  export let two;\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<h2>{two}</h2>\r\n<div>\r\n  <slot/>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<!-- src/routes/foo/bar.svelte -->\r\n<script context=\"module\">\r\n  export async function load({ fetch }) {\r\n    const res = await fetch('/three.json');\r\n    const { three } = await res.json();\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n      props: { three }\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n  export let three;\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<p>{three}</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n...then two things would happen. Firstly, we'd fetch `one.json`, `two.json` and `three.json` concurrently. Secondly, as soon as `one.json` returned, we'd flush\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<h1>1</h1>\r\n<div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen as soon as `two.json` returned, we'd flush\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<h2>2</h2>\r\n<div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen as soon as `three.json` returned, we'd flush the remainder:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<p>3</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt present, that's not possible. We run `load` functions in sequence for two reasons...\r\n\r\n1. we want to bail out early if a layout errors or causes a redirect — subsequent `load` functions should not run\r\n2. a nested route should be able to access any `stuff` that was returned from an rootward layout\r\n\r\n...and we can't render _anything_ until _everything_ has loaded, because the root layout might make use of `$page.stuff`.\r\n\r\nIdeally, we'd be able to solve all these problems without relying on a design that forces serial loading and delayed rendering.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nHonestly, I haven't really figured this out yet — I'm really just trying to articulate the problem in hopes that a solution will present itself. But here's a straw man:\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<script context=\"module\">\r\n  export async function load({ fetch, parent }) {\r\n    const stuff = await parent(); // merges stuff from all parent layouts\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n      stuff: {\r\n        b: stuff.a + 1\r\n      },\r\n      props: (stuff) => ({\r\n        // because `props` is a function, rendering is\r\n        // delayed until we have the final `stuff` object\r\n        title: stuff.title\r\n      })\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n  // this comes from the leaf component\r\n  export let title;\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<svelte:head>\r\n  <title>{title}</title>\r\n</svelte:head>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't feel totally intuitive, but it would speed up performance in the common case where `load` isn't blocked on its parents, and `$page.stuff` isn't used. And we would still have the ability to bail out if a parent `load` redirects (maybe `await parent()` throws an error for non-200 responses?)\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI am all ears.

#4910.\r\n\r\nThis replaces the `transformPage` API with `transformPageChunk`, so that we can respond in a streaming fashion in future. We're not yet taking advantage of that ability, but updating the API is the first step.\r\n\r\nPreviously, `transformPage` took the entire HTML document:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport function handle({ event, resolve }) {\r\n  return resolve(event, {\r\n    transformPage: ({ html }) => html.replace('old', 'new')\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, it takes a _chunk_ of HTML plus a `done` boolean. Chunks are not guaranteed to be well-formed HTML (they might include the opening tag of an element but not its closing tag, for example) but nor are they arbitrary — they will always be split at sensible boundaries (like `%sveltekit.[property]%` or before the contents of a layout or page component). Because of that, many transforms will work identically:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nexport function handle({ event, resolve }) {\r\n  return resolve(event, {\r\n-    transformPage: ({ html }) => html.replace('old', 'new')\r\n+    transformPageChunk: ({ html }) => html.replace('old', 'new')\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn some cases, it's necessary to operate on the entire document in one go — for example, to validate and transform an AMP document. In these situations it's easy to buffer the HTML and return the transformed document at the end:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport function handle({ event, resolve }) {\r\n  let buffer = '';\r\n  return resolve(event, {\r\n    transformPageChunk: ({ html, done }) => {\r\n      buffer += html;\r\n      if (done) return amp.transform(html);\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now, `done` will always be true (i.e. there'll only be one chunk, which is the entire document) but that will change in the near future.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5657/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7046585912,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5JpX-ezwAAAAGkAl44","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7046585912","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-22T13:35:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7046585940,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5JpX-ezwAAAAGkAl5U","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7046585940","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ab65de0c065df5e274082805bc379186eb6c15d3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/ab65de0c065df5e274082805bc379186eb6c15d3","created_at":"2022-07-22T13:35:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Korayem","id":198332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODMzMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korayem","html_url":"https://github.com/Korayem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korayem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korayem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korayem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korayem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korayem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korayem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korayem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korayem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korayem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-20T11:59:59Z","updated_at":"2022-12-20T11:59:59Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3091","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3091/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3091/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3091/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3091","id":1087235053,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c5AzePt","number":3091,"title":"Templating

Describe the problem\n\nCurrently SvelteKit templating is fairly simple: it replaces `%svelte.head%` and `%svelte.body%` entries in `app.html`.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes it is necessary to augment some parts of `app.html` that are outside of Svelte's control. \r\n\r\nFor example, for i18n one needs to be able to change the `lang` attribute on `<html>` or set a class on `<body>` tag.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nIt would be useful if SvelteKit provided some built-in templating solution for `app.html` that extends beyond replacing `%svelte.head%` and `%svelte.body%` and provides access other request parameters.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nIt is possible to do such templating in `handle` hook. For example, we can define some logic in `app.html` in EJS format and then run the templating engine on `response.body` before returning it from the hook.\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3091/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3091/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
