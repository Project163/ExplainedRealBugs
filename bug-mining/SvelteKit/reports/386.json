Describe the problem\n\nBecause of the layout reset syntax, it is currently possible to create multiple +page.svelte (or +layout.svelte)\r\n\r\nExemple :\r\n```\r\nroutes/path/page/\r\n           +page.svelte\r\n           +page@.svelte\r\n           +page@path.svelte\r\n```\r\n\r\nSveltekit seems to accept that, and choose the most complete file (`+page@my-path.svelte` in this example).\r\n\r\nI think this should be incorrect and generate an error.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nCreate a page with multiples +page.svelte file using layout-reset.\r\n\r\nExample :\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-ro1dgr?file=README.md\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional
