Description\r\n\r\nFixes #10366, related to #10030.\r\n\r\nAccording to the `fetch()`-specification, a header can have an `immutable`-guard which will throw a `TypeError` if the header is changed:\r\nhttps://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#headers-class\r\n\r\nWhen using `fetch()`, the spec requires the response header to be `immutable` (see step 12/4):\r\nhttps://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-method\r\n\r\nThis is implemented in undici (used by Node.js for native fetch() under the hood):\r\nhttps://github.com/nodejs/undici/blob/22bdbd8c7820035276b4e876daccef513c29f5c4/lib/fetch/headers.js#L234-L239\r\n\r\nSince PR https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/9993, a `TypeError` is thrown when using native `fetch()` because SvelteKit is trying to change the header from the fetch-response-object.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist!
