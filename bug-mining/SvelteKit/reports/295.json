I can't seem to find anywhere in the docs that tells new users where they should be putting their Svelte components. Considering components are such a key concept Svelte and SvelteKit, I would have certainly expected some good explanation about where they can/should live in your project structure.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nPretend you're new to SvelteKit. Follow the docs. Try to figure out where components should live. Search the site for \"components\" or \"project structure\" or \"component folder structure\".\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\nn/a\n```\n\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nn/a\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8443/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8443/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
