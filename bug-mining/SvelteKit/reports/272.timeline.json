It's `get_cookie_header` that adds the url-encoding, and that gets called after handleFetch.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you can't access the browser cookies in handleFetch, for two reasons:\r\n1. In handleFetch the `request` parameter does not yet include the cookies received from the browser - they get added later.\r\n2. `cookies` is not available as a parameter in handleFetch, so the browser cookies can't be accessed that way.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport async function handleFetch({ request, fetch }) {\r\n    // here the request object only contains the cookies added when the\r\n    // request was created i.e. when fetch was called from somewhere\r\n    // else in the app\r\n  }\r\n \r\n  return fetch(request);\r\n  // when you call fetch here it will call get_cookie_header, which adds\r\n  // the cookies that came from the browser (and also those added using\r\n  // cookies.set) and adds the url-encoding to the cookies\r\n```\r\nDoes cookie.js need to url-decode cookies that arrive from the browser? It needs to parse the cookie string, but I can't see the reason for decoding the cookie tokens, but perhaps I'm missing something.  If someone needs the decoded cookie token it can be accessed using `cookies.get()` which url-decodes by default.\r\n\r\n#7736 highlighted the issue that \"forwarded input cookies are different on the way out than on the way in\". Previously we were forcibly removing url-encoding before forwarding a cookie but now we are forcibly adding url-encoding before forwarding. I think it makes sense that forwarded cookies should be the same on the way out as on the way in.\r\n\r\n`cookies.set()` and `cookies.get()` have `encode`/`decode` options and cookie.js respects those options, so it's inconsistent for cookie.js to force encoding on forwarded cookies.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1336465004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jb297686","id":108226444,"node_id":"U_kgDOBnNnjA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108226444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jb297686","html_url":"https://github.com/jb297686","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jb297686/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jb297686/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jb297686/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jb297686/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jb297686/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jb297686/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jb297686/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jb297686/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jb297686/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8016317496,"node_id":"MIE_lADOEiPr8c5X3mkKzwAAAAHdz0w4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8016317496","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-12T16:53:19Z","milestone":{"title":"1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1346871934","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7929#issuecomment-1346871934","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7929","id":1346871934,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5QR6J-","user":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-12T16:53:45Z","updated_at":"2022-12-12T16:53:45Z","body":"(adding
