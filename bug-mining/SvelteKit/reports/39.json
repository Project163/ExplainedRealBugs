In Node `crypto.randomUUID()` it [has been available](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v14.x/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto_randomuuid_options) since v14.17.0. The Web Cryptography API, which appears to support web workers as well, uses the [same method name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/randomUUID).\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nDropping this dependency now that [support for Node 14 has ended](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4916) seems like a good time to cut the baggage.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nLeave the dependency in place. It's [slower than native methods](https://dev.to/galkin/crypto-randomuuid-vs-uuid-v4-47i5) but probably not noticeable in the demo.\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nnice to have\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4929/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
