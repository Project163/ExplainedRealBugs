Yes, that is true that those adapters tell esbuild to build for a browser but should not tell that the current code is running in the server or the browser. The problem is this causes an error in the worker script when trying to render the component to an HTML string i.e. when we want to use the `goto` function from `$app/navigation`. The `$app/navigation` has a guard function to prevent the server to use it before it initializes. So if `browser` is `true` then it will use the undefined value then throw an error. So even if the target platform is the browser it doesn't mean that the whole code is running in the browser environment in this case because Cloudflare Worker supported only browser API which doesn't mean that the server-side code is running in a real browser.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/src/runtime/app/navigation.js#L13-L15","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1345861117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"0x221A","id":26060677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDYwNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26060677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x221A","html_url":"https://github.com/0x221A","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x221A/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x221A/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x221A/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x221A/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x221A/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x221A/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x221A/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x221A/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/0x221A/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8010064262,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c5Y2-QCzwAAAAHdb-GG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8010064262","actor":{"login":"gtm-nayan","id":50981692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTgxNjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50981692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan","html_url":"https://github.com/gtm-nayan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-12T04:31:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8010064267,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5Y2-QCzwAAAAHdb-GL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8010064267","actor":{"login":"gtm-nayan","id":50981692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTgxNjky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50981692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan","html_url":"https://github.com/gtm-nayan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gtm-nayan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-12T04:31:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"benmccann","id":322311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/322311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/benmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-12T04:39:29Z","updated_at":"2022-12-12T04:39:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8083","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8083/label

this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8092/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8092/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8013013103,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5Y2-QCzwAAAAHdnOBv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8013013103","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-12T11:08:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8013013218,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5Y2-QCzwAAAAHdnODi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8013013218","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"abf9f3ae9ffc2c2c3eb5c14b4999e15c475e1b2d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/abf9f3ae9ffc2c2c3eb5c14b4999e15c475e1b2d","created_at":"2022-12-12T11:08:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8013014249,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c5Y2-QCzwAAAAHdnOTp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8013014249","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-12T11:08:37Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1507963403","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/8082#issuecomment-1507963403","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8082","id":1507963403,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5Z4bIL","user":{"login":"MelodicCrypter","id":18341500,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzQxNTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18341500?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MelodicCrypter","html_url":"https://github.com/MelodicCrypter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MelodicCrypter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MelodicCrypter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MelodicCrypter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://
