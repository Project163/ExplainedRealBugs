now it's rather difficult to use Svelte 5 alongside a linked `@sveltejs/kit`, because Kit imports `vite` and `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` relative to itself, even though these are peer dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis means that components will be compiled by Svelte 4 (as that's what the `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` inside the linked `@sveltejs/kit` depends on), but then try to use the Svelte 5 runtime.\r\n\r\nThis is already a nuisance but it will become much more of one as Svelte 5 gets closer to release and we're trying to make sure everything works in both versions.\r\n\r\n###

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11433/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1884974247","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/11578#issuecomment-1884974247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/11578","id":1884974247,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5wWmyn","user":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-10T14:39:33Z","updated_at":"2024-01-10T14:39:33Z","body":"[Yarn PnP is broken](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/faq#how-do-i-use-x-with-sveltekit-does-it-work-with-yarn-2), and we don't support it — if it ever worked, it was by accident.

have a SvelteKit project (which uses your library in version 4.0.0) which runs fine on my Debian VM but fails to resolve a dependency both on a Mac and a Windows machine when using Yarn pnp linker (it works everywhere with Yarn node-modules liker though).\r\n\r\nAfter clearing out any other reason (fresh branch checkout on all machines, no changes...) I had to trace the code, and I ended up looking into SvelteKit code and figured the following line didn't behave the same between platforms:\r\n\r\n`const resolved = await imr.resolve(dependency, pathToFileURL(process.cwd() + '/dummy.js'));`\r\n\r\nOn my linux VM I get a path, on the other machine an exception. On this line `imr` is being imported from your library with: `import * as imr from 'import-meta-resolve';`.\r\n\r\nSince I use Node 20, I tried changing the line to:\r\n\r\n`const resolved = import.meta.resolve(dependency, pathToFileURL(process.cwd() + '/dummy.js'));`\r\n\r\nAnd everything works on all machines.\r\n\r\nFor reference, this is the location of the call in the SvelteKit project: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/a6333a5d0833781c6572098a6240976e84fb5150/packages/kit/src/exports/vite/index.js#L134\r\n\r\nI must admit I don't have a clue as to what causes the issue, in particular we have no space in the paths and they are reasonable in length (48 to 65 characters depending on platform).\r\n\r\nDon't hesitate to let me know if there a place where I could look for more details to help solve

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12532/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12532/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15940912504,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c57n71NzwAAAAO2JwV4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/15940912504","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-15T13:15:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15940912555,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c57n71NzwAAAAO2JwWr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/15940912555","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"699f4405c752261cf46c1ad32e4dbadceaffc75b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/699f4405c752261cf46c1ad32e4dbadceaffc75b","created_at":"2025-01-15T13:15:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
