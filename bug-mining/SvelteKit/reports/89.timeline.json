You added another top level folder, so you need to adjust the tsconfig yourself. It sucks that [there's no mechanism](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#extends) to tell tsconfig to \"add these includes in addition to the ones from extends\", so right now your solution is the only one that's working. We can't do \"use all files in the current directory\" because that also includes those from node_modules, the `.svelte-kit` folder and others which you might _not_ want to have included.\r\n\r\nLeaving this open for another maintainer to give their opinion on this (specifically, if we should adjust the includes/excludes of the generated tsconfig with a blacklist instead of a whitelist), but I say that there's unfortunately nothing we can do about this.\r\n\r\nThe reason why you get this warning is that test is not in the includes config, so it creates a separate typechecking project which has no knowledge of the ambient type definitions which link to a definition which marks all `*.svelte` files as something that exists.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1206444351/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7135822691,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c5PRN46zwAAAAGpVANj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7135822691","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-05T13:11:56Z","label":{"name":"types

add some notes to tsconfig/jsonfig\r\nFixes #5833\r\n\r\nI briefly thought about making this configurable through `kit.files`, but didn't do so because only the tsconfig includes generation would benefit from it - you'd still need to update the package.json scripts yourself.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6085/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7226607361,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5PRN46zwAAAAGuvUcB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7226607361","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-20T17:55:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7226607372,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5PRN46zwAAAAGuvUcM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7226607372","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9b24b9c1bc486e294bd83261b038d13847103bbc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/9b24b9c1bc486e294bd83261b038d13847103bbc","created_at":"2022-08-20T17:55:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
