You'll see a 303 redirect even though we passed in \"302\".\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\nStatus code: 200\r\nStatus code: 303\r\nStatus code: 200\n```\n\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 13.0.1\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Pro\r\n    Memory: 62.42 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.9.0 - /opt/homebrew/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - ~/.yarn/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 9.1.3 - /opt/homebrew/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 108.0.5359.124\r\n    Safari: 16.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^1.0.0 => 1.0.0\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.0.0 => 1.0.1\r\n    svelte: ^3.54.0 => 3.55.0\r\n    vite: ^4.0.0 => 4.0.1\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI'm guessing this isn't a big deal for most of the client rendered apps out there. But if there are any server rendered apps that rely on non-303 redirects from a form action, e.g. a Permanent redirect, this will be important.","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8209/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
