I have reproduced this issue with a new Chrome 103.0.5060.114 profile (no extensions) and also on iOS Safari 15.5.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n1. Visit https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction\r\n2. Click the 'Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code)' link\r\n3. Go back\r\n4. Observe that https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction is now stuck in the 'loading' state (top orange bar) and grayed-out page after a few seconds\r\n\r\nIf this does not repro, you may need to restart a new-profile Chrome a few times for it to enable the back/forward cache by default. This issue does not reproduce if 'Back-forward cache' is explicitly disabled in chrome://flags/.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\nThere doesn't appear to be anything in the DevTools Console or Network tabs\r\n\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nChrome 103.0.5060.114 on Windows 10 21H2\r\n\r\niOS Safari 15.5 on iPhone 11\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI have not tested whether this affects SvelteKit in general","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
