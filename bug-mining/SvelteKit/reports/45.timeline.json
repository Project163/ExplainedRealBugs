I think I might be wrong - I wasn't aware the request could cache-bust an immutable resource like this. TBH, I can't find this trick explicitly documented anywhere online, and the `version is immutable` statement seems all wrong to me - almost by definition, the version _will change over time_. \r\n\r\nI did however see some buggy behaviour, but it could be with userland code. I'll try and get a reduced test case.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1125442169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"georgecrawford","id":84737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/84737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgecrawford","html_url":"https://github.com/georgecrawford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgecrawford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgecrawford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgecrawford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgecrawford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgecrawford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgecrawford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgecrawford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgecrawford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/georgecrawford/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1126163565","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4837#issuecomment-1126163565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4837","id":1126163565,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5DH-Rt","user":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-13T15:12:42Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T15:12:42Z","body":"Ah, interesting — I thought if a CDN received a `no-cache` request it would go back to the origin server.
