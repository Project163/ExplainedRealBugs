Describe the bug\n\nThe project template at https://github.com/sveltejs/kit-template-default/\r\n\r\n- was last updated 3 days ago (commit: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit-template-default/commit/a31f06909dfcd218bfb71489ea0c9188d7c8bd79);\r\n- specifies its dependency on `@sveltejs/kit` as `\"@sveltejs/kit\": \"next\"`.\r\n\r\nWhen breaking changes are shipped in SvelteKit that impact this template, it must be updated immediately or every user that creates a new project from this template will have a broken project on their hand. This is especially the case for StackBlitz, which uses https://sveltekit.new/ which redirects to https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/sveltejs/kit-template-default. For instance here's a bug report about this starter being broken: https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-core/issues/803\r\n\r\nI tested locally and with the latest version of the template, here are the results with different SvelteKit versions:\r\n\r\n| @sveltejs/kit version | Result of `npm run dev` |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| 1.0.0-next.470| 500 Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get') |\r\n| 1.0.0-next.471| 500 Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'get') |\r\n| 1.0.0-next.472| ok |\r\n| 1.0.0-next.474| ok |\r\n| 1.0.0-next.475| ok |\r\n| 1.0.0-next.476| ok |\r\n| 1.0.0-next.477| Error: Rename your server hook file from src/hooks.js to src/hooks.server.js |\r\n| 1.0.0-next.478| Error: Rename your server hook file from src/hooks.js to src/hooks.server.js |\r\n| 1.0.0-next.479| Error: Rename your server hook file from src/hooks.js to src/hooks.server.js |\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nReproductions will only work for the current @sveltejs/kit@next and current HEAD commit of the `sveltejs/kit-template-default` repo, of course.\r\n\r\nOnline:\r\n\r\n1. Visit https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/sveltejs/kit-template-default (Chrome-based browser or Firefox)\r\n2. Wait for dependency installation to finish and `npm run dev` to start.\r\n3. The preview frame should show an error.\r\n\r\nLocally:\r\n\r\n1. Setup:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngit clone git@github.com:sveltejs/kit-template-default.git\r\ncd kit-template-default\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm run dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.
