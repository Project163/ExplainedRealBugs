Describe the bug\n\nI have a route that I don't need any component rendered for. I just need to do some work in the `load` function of a `+page.server.ts` file and then return a redirect (or throw error for `+error.svelte` to catch). This currently works but I ran into a small bug. If I don't have an empty `+page.svelte` file in addition to my `+page.server.ts` file, no types are generated in `.svelte-kit/types/src/routes` folder. I therefore can't `import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';`\r\n\r\nI tried using a `+server.ts` file for this but the functionality recently changed to not allow `+error.svelte` to catch thrown errors from a `+server.ts` files. See issue https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5993 and PR https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/6028\r\n\r\n### **+page.server.ts**\r\n```\r\nimport { error, redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';\r\nimport type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';\r\n\r\nconst shortcodes: { [index: string]: string } = {\r\n\tmicrosoft: 'https://www.microsoft.com',\r\n\tgoogle: 'https://www.google.com'\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport const load: PageServerLoad = ({ params }) => {\r\n\tif (!params.shortcode || !shortcodes[params.shortcode]) {\r\n\t\tthrow error(404, 'Shortcode not found');\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn redirect(301, shortcodes[params.shortcode]);\r\n};\r\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\nCreate a `+page.server.ts` file without a `+page.svelte` file. Check if any types were generated by `npm run dev` in `.svelte-kit/types/src/routes`\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.5\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max\r\n    Memory: 5.49 GB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.7.0 - /opt/homebrew/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.16.0 - /opt/homebrew/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 104.1.42.95\r\n    Chrome: 104.0.5112.79\r\n    Firefox Developer Edition: 104.0\r\n    Safari: 15.6\r\n    Safari Technology Preview: 16.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.64\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.417\r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.49.0\r\n    vite: ^3.0.0 => 3.0.8\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6044/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6044/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
