For one page, this is not too bad, but having to do this for every route is very cumbersome.\r\n\r\nI realize I can access the `result` prop in the `enhance` callback, but again, it requires more setup if I want to use this data to populate input values and errors, and it would not work without js.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nAdd the `form` prop to the `page` store.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nDo this in userland, like using a store, context or passing the data as prop. In every page.\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nThis issue brought the issue count back to 300, sorry for this :)","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6701/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6701/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
