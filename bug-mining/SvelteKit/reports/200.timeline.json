I've been getting it on the root route `+page.server.js/ts` file, but I've been able to also replicate it with the default create-svelte app. Stackblitz link [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-tctov7?file=src/routes/+page.server.js).\r\nIn my experience if you have a `+page.server.js/ts` in the root of the routes, the `/__data.json` won't exist so it can't fetch any of the data that you are trying to pass at prerender. On full page load it works, but on prerender it doesn't. Seems like quite the braking issue.\r\n\r\nEdit: This issue seems to only exists on server only routes. If you make the `+page.server.js/ts` to a `+page.js/ts` this doesn't seem to happen. But obviously you may need some API data on root that may require secret API keys.\r\n\r\nEdit 2: as a momentary fix, I've been able to downgrade to 527 and the issue doesn't appear anymore. So I assume that it comes from the changes in [this
