In that project despite an identical setup ISR seems to work properly for the index route with `prerender = 'auto'`. However, it doesn't work for any API routes.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n# Not caching anything without prerender\r\nhttps://sveltekit-isr-repro-682h0lk7v-zusor.vercel.app/  \r\nhttps://github.com/zusorio/sveltekit-isr-repro/tree/3d05c49c3f90e7c2a551e5b7b48de36a007e0cc5\r\n\r\n# Caching indefinitely with prerender = 'auto'\r\nhttps://sveltekit-isr-repro-pmrfpyg4k-zusor.vercel.app/  \r\nhttps://github.com/zusorio/sveltekit-isr-repro/tree/38cc230ee687ea1be8b39eeaa0e6e7f149fb6f08\r\n\r\n# Caching nothing with and without prerender = 'auto'\r\nhttps://sveltekit-isr-repro.vercel.app/  \r\nhttps://github.com/zusorio/sveltekit-isr-repro\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.22621\r\n    CPU: (12) x64 AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor\r\n    Memory: 3.13 GB / 15.95 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.19.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    npm: 8.19.3 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 110.0.5481.104\r\n    Edge: Spartan (44.22621.1265.0), Chromium (110.0.1587.50)\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.22621.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-vercel: ^2.1.0 => 2.1.0\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.5.0 => 1.8.3\r\n    svelte: ^3.54.0 => 3.55.1\r\n    vite: ^4.0.0 => 4.1.4\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9182/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
