https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/13280\r\n\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5907 we need to import the param matchers file ending with `.js` so that when the `moduleResolution` is set to something strict such as `NodeNext` (the default for libraries) the type inference isn't lost when it can't resolve the param matcher file due to the lack of a file extension.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked.
