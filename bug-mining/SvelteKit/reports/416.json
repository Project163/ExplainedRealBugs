Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI like to consolidate all of my environment variable usage, (imports) in as few as places as possible and I like to provide validation of the env vars using something like Zod. This means I usually create 2 files: `$lib/server/env.ts` and `$lib/client/env.ts`. \r\n\r\nThe issue is that when I import the private env vars using `import * as staticServerEnv from \"$env/static/private\"` Kit will include a `const SOME_VAR = <value at compile time>` for every env var in the environment. This results in many unrelated private env vars being included in the generated code.\r\n\r\nE.g. \r\n```ts\r\n// $lib/server/env.ts\r\nimport z from 'zod'\r\n\r\nimport { env as dynamicClientEnv } from '$env/dynamic/public'\r\nimport * as staticClientEnv from '$env/static/public'\r\nimport { env as dynamicServerEnv } from '$env/dynamic/private'\r\nimport * as staticServerEnv from '$env/static/private'   // <------------ PROBLEM\r\n\r\nimport { Env as ClientEnv } from '../client/env'\r\n\r\nconst Env = ClientEnv.extend({\r\n  ENV: z.enum(['prod', 'dev']).default('dev'),\r\n  AUTH_COOKIE_NAME: z.string().default('auth'),\r\n  ENCRYPTION_KEY: z.string().length(32),\r\n})\r\n\r\nconst combinedEnv = {\r\n  ...staticClientEnv,\r\n  ...dynamicClientEnv,\r\n  ...staticServerEnv,\r\n  ...dynamicServerEnv,\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst env = Env.parse(combinedEnv)\r\nexport default env as z.infer<typeof Env>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs compiled into something like the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport z from \"zod\";\r\nimport { p as public_env, b as private_env } from \"./shared-server.js\";\r\nimport { E as Env$1, s as staticClientEnv } from \"./env2.js\";\r\nconst npm_package_devDependencies__tailwindcss_typography = \"^0.5.9\";\r\nconst STARSHIP_SHELL = \"zsh\";\r\nconst MANPATH = \"/opt/homebrew/share/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/local/share/man:/opt/homebrew/share/man::\";\r\nconst LDFLAGS = \" -L/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/lib -L/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql-client/lib\";\r\nconst TERM_PROGRAM = \"vscode\";\r\nconst ENCRYPTION_KEY = \"******************************\";\r\nconst AUTH_JWT_SECRET = \"*******************************\";\r\nconst NODE = \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/node@18/18.16.0/bin/node\";\r\nconst npm_package_devDependencies__iconify_json_heroicons = \"^1.1.10\";\r\nconst INIT_CWD = \"/Users/*********/Development/**************\";\r\nconst npm_package_devDependencies_typescript = \"^5.0.0\";\r\nconst TERM = \"xterm-256color\";\r\nconst SHELL = \"/bin/zsh\";\r\nconst HOST = \"localhost\";\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nI propose that a new, optional configuration item be added that would control the prefix for private env vars included in the bundle. E.g. `privatePrefix?: string;` that would default to the empty string. This should make it backward compatible with current behavior.\r\n\r\nThen, some code will need to be added to the compiler to filter the `process.env` vars using the prefix before writing them out to the server bundle.\r\n\r\nThis would provide a couple of benefits:\r\n1. Would provide added assurance that no unintentional environment variables make their way into the server bundle.\r\n2. Would provide a solution to the foot-gun of `import * as env from \"$env/static/private\"` for those who read the docs.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nObviously, I can do something like, `import { var1, var2, var3, ...} from \"$env/static/private\"` but that leads to duplicated code and doesn't provide the benefit of a solution like a `privatePrefix` would for making *sure* no unintentional environment vars are added to server bundles.\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nAs always, thanks for SvelteKit and all the great work you folks do!","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9776/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9776/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
