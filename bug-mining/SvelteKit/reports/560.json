The error does not occur during build. \n\nThis error also does not occur when importing `@node-rs/argon2` in a page `load()` function, only in remote functions.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-argon2-remote\n\nthe index page demonstrates the behavior with remote functions, and the `/loader` page demonstrates the behavior when calling the same function in a page `load()` fn.\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\n7:45:25 AM [vite] (client) error while updating dependencies:\nError: Error during dependency optimization:\n\n✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"@node-rs/argon2-wasm32-wasi\"\n\n    node_modules/@node-rs/argon2/browser.js:1:14:\n      1 │ export * from '@node-rs/argon2-wasm32-wasi'\n        ╵               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n  You can mark the path \"@node-rs/argon2-wasm32-wasi\" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which will remove this error and leave the unresolved path in the bundle.\n\n\n    at failureErrorWithLog (/[project-path]/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js:1467:15)\n    at /[project-path]/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js:926:25\n    at /[project-path]/node_modules/esbuild/lib/main.js:1345:9\n    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:105:5)\n```\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\n    OS: macOS 26.0\n    CPU: (12) arm64 Apple M4 Pro\n    Memory: 708.56 MB / 24.00 GB\n    Shell: 4.0.2 - /opt/homebrew/bin/fish\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 22.18.0 - ~/.local/share/mise/installs/node/22.18.0/bin/node\n    npm: 10.9.3 - ~/.local/share/mise/installs/node/22.18.0/bin/npm\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 140.0.7339.133\n    Safari: 26.0\n  npmPackages:\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^6.0.0 => 6.1.0 \n    @sveltejs/kit: ^2.22.0 => 2.43.2 \n    @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte: ^6.0.0 => 6.2.0 \n    svelte: ^5.25.0 => 5.39.4 \n    vite: ^7.0.4 => 7.1.7\n```\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThis is the same log message as #13061, but it only occurs during dev.","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14519/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14519/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
