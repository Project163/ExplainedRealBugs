#9901 \r\n\r\nBypasses setting Kit defaults on cookies parsed from fetch response headers. To illustrate what the problem was:\r\n\r\n- Set a cookie in `+server.ts`: `cookies.set('foo', 'bar', { httpOnly: false })`\r\n- `fetch` this endpoint from `+page.server.ts`\r\n- As part of `fetch`, parse the cookies from the headers\r\n- `httpOnly` isn't set (because `false === unset`)\r\n- Adding this cookie to the cookies causes the default `httpOnly: true` to be added\r\n\r\nThe better solution here is not to apply defaults to cookies we parse from fetch response headers. _If_ these cookies were set through `cookies.set` in a `+server.ts` endpoint, we've already set the defaults, and if they're not, we shouldn't touch them anyway.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9908/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9230386243,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5llx12zwAAAAImLIRD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/9230386243","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-12T08:17:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9230386585,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5llx12zwAAAAImLIWZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/9230386585","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"26d2b7f8f5ca29c60ef61b936ff86deaeb1636ce","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/26d2b7f8f5ca29c60ef61b936ff86deaeb1636ce","created_at":"2023-05-12T08:18:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
