add ActionFailure interface and use that publicly instead of the class. Prevents the false impression that you could do \"instanceof\" on the return type, fixes #10361\r\n- add uniqueSymbol to ActionFailure instance so we can distinguish it from a regular return with the same shape\r\n- fix setup to actually run test/types\r\n\r\nSomeone with a non-windows machine has to check in the type diff (and double check it) because I can't do it properly. There's a bug in `dts-buddy` somewhere that break path resolving on Windows (I'm guessing a missing `\\` to `/` conversion).\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or
