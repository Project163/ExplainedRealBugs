this feature sounds awesome, this amplifies the problems with removing the option of disabling prerendering, as I said:\r\n\r\n> Today, you can disable that with `config.kit.prerender.enabled = false`. But if we're leaning more in this direction, we would probably need to get rid of that option.\r\n> \r\n> For my testing, I like to build some projects locally with prerendering disabled (for debugging prerendering issues and also for faster build time). Therefore, removing the options to (temporary) disable prerendering is not preferable for me, and I believe also for other people.\r\n> \r\n> I do agree that this configuration in `svelte.config.js` is problematic. **As a compromise, maybe except some environment variable to disable prerendering or such?**\r\n> \r\n_Originally posted by @Tal500 in https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/7716#discussioncomment-4371528_\r\n\r\nThough this problem was amplified, the solution seems to be more clear now - perhaps add a configuration of `prerendering`, to be one of these three states:\r\n1. `'disabled'`: No prerendering, ignoring each page settings.\r\n2. `'strict'`: Prerender each page if and only if in the page settings `prerender === true`.\r\n3. `'lax'`: Prerender each page if and only if in the condition you mentioned in this issue is happening(can be changed in the future to be even more laxed).\r\n\r\nObvious note: This issue suggests to make the third option the default, while currently the second one is the default.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1345821737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Tal500","id":1467072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjcwNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1467072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500","html_url":"https://github.com/Tal500","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8009805295,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c5D_P0TzwAAAAHda-3v","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8009805295","actor":{"login":"Tal500","id":1467072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjcwNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1467072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500","html_url":"https://github.com/Tal500","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-12T03:31:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8009805300,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5D_P0TzwAAAAHda-30","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8009805300","actor":{"login":"Tal500","id":1467072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjcwNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1467072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500","html_url":"https://github.com/Tal500","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tal500/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-12T03:31:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1346736981","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/3966#issuecomment-1346736981","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3966","id":1346736981,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5QRZNV","user":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-12T15:40:07Z","updated_at":"2022-12-12T15:40:07Z","body":"I'm

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit
