Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5987/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7210419914,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c5QA3KozwAAAAGtxkbK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7210419914","actor":{"login":"benmccann","id":322311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/322311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/benmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-18T03:03:27Z","label":{"name":"p2-nice-to-have","color":"A7463B"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-18T21:12:26Z","updated_at":"2022-08-18T21:12:26Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5696","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5696/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5696/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5696/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5696","id":1316000893,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c5OcJR9","number":5696,"title":"Using

This is ok and I do not care for now.\r\n\r\nBut, I'd welcome some outlook and more that we address this post 1.0.0 ETA. The users need to migrate to the latest next version now because the longer they wait the harder the migration will get bc of the major routing overhaul.\r\n\r\nThis silent change and intro of `check_serializability` is not jut a breaking change, it's blocking.\r\n\r\nHence, I'd appreciate if you guys rethink you decision for/against superjson and/or commit to some ETA for the integration of devalue in SvelteKit + integration of all lacking types.\r\n\r\nWould be also great if @Rich-Harris could give his take, I mean what is your recommendation now for users like us, wait and
