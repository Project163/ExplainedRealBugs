[this](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5#issuecomment-712725420) here:\r\n\r\n>One blocking issue I've run into with the current Sapper is that I can't rewrite urls from various sites that we want to host a \"whitelabel\" version of our app on, because the basepath has to be set in stone at build time:\r\n>\r\n> https://example.com/some-path/ <-- does not work\r\n> https://subdomain.example.com/ <-- works fine\r\n> \r\n> rather than host a different app for people who want to mount it under a subpath, ideally basepath could be a runtime concern. However I don't know if this is feasible, but it's worth considering.\r\n\r\n> Cool. For me it is to support ipfs website both when served through an ENS domain or through a gateway with ipfs/ base path for example, both url point to the same exact content : \r\n> https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeieeuq3av6jdys2q2zwhfv5hutcqejczr46wzjikd5vulfaxfi72r4/\r\n> https://jolly-roger.eth.link/\r\n> for the hash version, I have to compute at runtime the basepath since it is not possible to know the hash of an ipfs website at build time\r\n>\r\n> https://ptb.discord.com/channels/457912077277855764/750388563354583071/771786495152357386\r\n\r\n`paths.base` is baked into the app at build time.

Perhaps even a brief section in the documentation would do the trick! \r\nI'm aware that Twitch's extensions represent a very specialized segment, similar to IPFS apps, but who knows if this solution might be useful in other contexts where a SPAs with an undefined server route is required.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, I am a bit rusty with this issue as several months have elapsed since I first opened it. However, I recall being surprised/confused at the time that the behavior _I_ expected for SPAs with `paths.relative` only manifested in scenarios involving a pre-rendered single page with a fallback to another page. The `paths.relative` aspect seemed particularly promising as a solution for this project, but ultimately it proved to be somewhat confusing. 😂\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1849586559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Giggiux","id":9947659,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5NDc2NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9947659?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Giggiux","html_url":"https://github.com/Giggiux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Giggiux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Giggiux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Giggiux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Giggiux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Giggiux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Giggiux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Giggiux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Giggiux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Giggiux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1850230815","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/10235#issuecomment-1850230815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10235","id":1850230815,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5uSEgf","user":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-11T14:49:39Z","updated_at":"2023-12-11T14:49:39Z","body":"I'm not 100% sure I understand the workaround — are you saying that you used the `random.html` (which would contain relative paths) as the fallback?\r\n\r\nIf the extension always opens on the root route (i.e. it's not possible to deep-link to a page within the extension app) then yeah, just having an empty `src/routes/+page.svelte` and prerendering that (and using the resulting `index.html` instead of the fallback `200.html` as the entry point) should suffice.
