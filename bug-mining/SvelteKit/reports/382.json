[There already is an issue going a bit into this](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7175). In the meantime a simple non-breaking change to the `enhance` action could already help.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the `enhance` form action would expose the `submitter` of the submit event. This would allow us to do things like the following without having to create multiple `loading` variables and/or wrap the list item/form in a separate component.\r\n```html\r\n<ol>\r\n  {#each files as file (file.name)}\r\n    <li>\r\n      <span>{file.name}</span>\r\n      <form\r\n        method=\"POST\"\r\n        action=\"?/delete\"\r\n        use:enhance={({ submitter }) => {\r\n          submitter.setAttribute(\"disabled\", \"true\");\r\n\r\n          return ({ update }) => {\r\n            update().then(() => submitter.removeAttribute(\"disabled\"));\r\n          };\r\n        }}\r\n      >\r\n        <button name=\"filename\" value={file.name}>\r\n          Delete\r\n        </button>\r\n      </form>\r\n    </li>\r\n  {/each}\r\n</ol>\r\n```\r\nCurrently we can of course use `form.querySelector('button')` but this just adds a bit more code and wouldn't work with multiple submit buttons.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nnice to have\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9414/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/9414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
