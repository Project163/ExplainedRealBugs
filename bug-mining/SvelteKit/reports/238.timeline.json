In my case, given the following query in `+layout.server.ts`:\r\n\r\n```graphql\r\nquery Me {\r\n  me {\r\n    id\r\n    username\r\n    email\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will generate the following in `+layout.server.d.ts`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport type MeQuery = {\r\n  __typename?: 'Query',\r\n  me?: {\r\n    __typename?: 'AppUser',\r\n    id: string,\r\n    username: string,\r\n    email: string\r\n  } | null\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis type can be imported into the original `+layout.server.ts` file and used to type the response that comes back from a GraphQL request. It also types variables that go into your queries and mutations. Notice that it properly handles nulls and nesting and whatnot so you get full type safety.\r\n\r\nThere are other tools that generate `.d.ts` files as well. One I've used before (which admittedly doesn't apply to Svelte as far as I'm aware) is https://github.com/skovy/typed-scss-modules, which generates `.d.ts` files to allow you to safely import CSS modules.\r\n\r\nI have not personally used any other tools but I know there are other tools that exist that generate various `.d.ts` files for type-safely importing things that the TypeScript compiler doesn't understand on its own.\r\n\r\nI'm also aware of [Houdini](https://www.houdinigraphql.com/). While it looks really cool, at my first evaluation it didn't seem like a good fit for my project.\r\n\r\n`.d.ts` files can only contain type exports, not executable code, so thinking about my first proposed solution, if TypeScript is a first-class citizen of SvelteKit then I think it makes sense to just ignore them.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1315494647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"knpwrs","id":174864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDg2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/174864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs","html_url":"https://github.com/knpwrs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1315500003","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7662#issuecomment-1315500003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7662","id":1315500003,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5OaO_j","user":{"login":"knpwrs","id":174864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDg2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/174864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs","html_url":"https://github.com/knpwrs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knpwrs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-15T15:45:12Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T15:45:12Z","body":"> I have not personally used any other tools but I know there are other tools that exist that generate various `.d.ts` files for type-safely importing things that the TypeScript compiler doesn't understand on its own.\r\n\r\nActually, there is one other I've used: https://github.com/adelsz/pgtyped.
