Describe the bug\n\n1. `+layout.server.ts` returns `data` that's necessary for the pages using that particular layout.\r\n2. `data` is linked to layout, each layout (only using one at the moment) returns a unique `data`.\r\n3. `data` returned on the first render works as expected.\r\n4. `data` returned after navigating pages using the layout is `null` or `undefined`.\r\n\r\n`//layout.server.ts`\r\n`export async function load() {\r\n\treturn { app: 'MAIN TITLE' };\r\n}\r\n`\n\n### Reproduction\n\nReproduction here: [github repo](https://github.com/ofeenee/sveltekit-layout-data-undefined) (npm run dev and check console/browser)\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.5\r\n

but not with `+layout.server.ts` (`parent`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5954/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7200878781,"node_id":"RTE_lADOEiPr8c5P2o76zwAAAAGtNLC9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7200878781","actor":{"login":"Conduitry","id":16696352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njk2MzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16696352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry","html_url":"https://github.com/Conduitry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-16T22:07:59Z","rename":{"from":"await
