While prerendering, SvelteKit will bail on any page that is not prerenderable, which includes `/foo` because there's no `export const prerender` (and `config.kit.prerender.default` isn't `true`). Right now it only respects `export const prerender` in `+page.js`, not `+page.server.js` — that's a bug. \r\n\r\nIf you change it back to what you were doing before...\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// src/routes/foo/+server.js\r\nimport { redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';\r\n\r\n/** @type {import('./$types').RequestHandler} */\r\nexport async function GET() {\r\n  return new Response(undefined, {\r\n    status: 302,\r\n    headers: {\r\n      location: '/foo/bar'\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...then it will work, because it doesn't have a concept of 'prerenderable endpoints'.

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6012/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7212156047,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5P5YwEzwAAAAGt4MSP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7212156047","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-18T08:28:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7212156125,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5P5YwEzwAAAAGt4MTd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7212156125","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7b305af71d1abbe9913b076a57bf59ed0c1e0e31","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/7b305af71d1abbe9913b076a57bf59ed0c1e0e31","created_at":"2022-08-18T08:28:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1219696077","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5926#issuecomment-1219696077","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5926","id":1219696077,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5IsxXN","user":{"login":"acarl005","id":8334252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzQyNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8334252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acarl005","html_url":"https://github.com/acarl005","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acarl005/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acarl005/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acarl005/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acarl005/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acarl005/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acarl005/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acarl005/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acarl005/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acarl005/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-18T16:28:18Z","updated_at":"2022-08-18T16:28:18Z","body":"Works great!
