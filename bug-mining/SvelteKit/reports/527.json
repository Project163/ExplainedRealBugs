This is odd because the Vite config docs (https://vite.dev/config/preview-options.html#preview-cors) suggest that `'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'` is set in `preview` mode.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/stephenlrandall/kit-cors-issue\n\nIn dev mode, the page loads. When deployed (https://stephenlrandall.github.io/kit-cors-issue/), the page loads. But when you build and then run `pnpm preview`, an error appears.\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\nError: CORS error: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource\n    at universal_fetch (file:///<path>/kit-cors-issue/.svelte-kit/output/server/index.js:1232:17)\n```\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\n    OS: macOS 15.2\n    CPU: (16) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\n    Memory: 81.64 MB / 16.00 GB\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 20.8.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\n    npm: 10.1.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 9.15.4 - ~/Library/pnpm/pnpm\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 132.0.6834.84\n    Edge: 132.0.2957.115\n    Safari: 18.2\n  npmPackages:\n    @sveltejs/adapter-static: ^3.0.0 => 3.0.8 \n    @sveltejs/kit: ^2.0.0 => 2.16.1 \n    @sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte: ^4.0.0 => 4.0.4 \n    svelte: ^5.0.0 => 5.19.1 \n    vite: ^5.4.11 => 5.4.14\n```\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThe workaround is to just not ever use the `preview` mode, which isn't the end of the world but it's also not really a workaround.\n\nThe reproduction looks contrived, but this issue arose for me when trying to create an inline bundle for a portable SPA. The usual `fetch` approach doesn't work over `file://` and so I swapped to `import.meta.glob`. Dynamically importing files that way didn't seem to play nicely with HMR, but when you `fetch` the globbed URLs, HMR works wonderfully. But that leads to this issue.","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13362/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
