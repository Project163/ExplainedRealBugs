please.\r\n\r\nReally though, I like either `invalid` or `failure`. I'm mostly ok with `invalid` because it describes how you're choosing to handle the error. The `invalid` function takes some backend reality and decides it will hand it to the client-side +page to handle it as a bad response, rather than as the +error page. If it wraps a 500 that seems fine to me because the 500 describes what went wrong, and the use of `invalid` describes how we're passing it forward. I could see `failure` too, and in any case `ValidationError` should probably be changed.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I could see changing `error`/`invalid` to something like `panic`/`error` to capture that one is disrupting the usual flow of your app and the other is passing on a bad message.

Another couple of reasons presented themselves:\r\n\r\n* 'invalid' is used elsewhere in the framework to refer to data that is out of date and needs to be refetched. It's arguably confusing to have `invalid(...)` and `invalidate(...)` to refer to different meanings of the word\r\n* The `type` of an `ActionResult` can be `success`, `failure`, `redirect` or `error`. `failure` is a better counterpart to `success` than `invalid`. (Also, all four are now nouns, instead of three nouns and an adjective. It's a happy coincidence that `redirect` and `error` are also verbs*, making them suitable as function names as well.)\r\n\r\n<sub>*if someone wanted to be persnickity they could challenge the notion that 'error' is a verb, but I think it's used as a verb often enough in programming that I can claim it with a straight face</sub>","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1343762695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1344128574","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7982#issuecomment-1344128574","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7982","id":1344128574,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5QHcY-","user":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-09T10:29:17Z","updated_at":"2022-12-09T10:29:17Z","body":"Still not fully convinced.
