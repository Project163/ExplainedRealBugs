is a property used for `adapter-cloudflare` and `adapter-cloudflare-workers`. Because it is invoked earlier than needed, `vitest` runs hang as the `Miniflare` instance is not released. This PR makes `Adapter.emulator` called right before its return value is needed. `prerender` code is changed too, but it seems that `adapter-cloudflare/cloudflare-workers` don't allow pages to be prerendered. Return type of `dev` was changed because of ESLint error banning `async` functions without any `await`s. It still returns [an allowed type](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html#configureserver).\r\n\r\nTo make sure `dev`/`preview` server works with no problems, I've visually checked the rendered output of `packages/kit/test/apps/cloudflare` by running `dev` and `build`/`preview`. Also I've added a Playwright test to make sure the page is properly rendered and able to connect to Cloudflare KV namespaces.\r\n\r\nFixes #12305.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12306/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12306/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/2218195227","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/12305#issuecomment-2218195227","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12305","id":2218195227,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c6ENvkb","user":{"login":"Oreoezi","id":37777619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc3NjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37777619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oreoezi","html_url":"https://github.com/Oreoezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oreoezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oreoezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oreoezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oreoezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oreoezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oreoezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oreoezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oreoezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oreoezi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-09T16:42:37Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T16:42:37Z","body":"I

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked.
