But creating the +error.svelte file inside this directory doesn't solve the problem even though the documentation says it should've done so:\r\n`SvelteKit will 'walk up the tree' looking for the closest error boundary — if the file above didn't exist it would try src/routes/blog/+error.svelte and src/routes/+error.svelte before rendering the default error page.`\r\nhttps://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#error\r\n\r\nMy file hierarchy:\r\n- src/routes/\r\n- - +page.svelte\r\n- - +error.svelte\r\n- - tee\r\n- - - +page.svelte\r\n- - - +error.svelte\r\n\r\nWhen I go to `/` I see the contents of `src/routes/+page.svelte`\r\nWhen I go to `/tee` I see the contents of `src/routes/tee/+page.svelte`\r\nAnd when I go to `/error` (non-existent route) I see the contents of `src/routes/+error.svelte`\r\nBut when I go to `/tee/error` (non-existent route) I still see the contents of `src/routes/+error.svelte`. But I expect to see the contents of `src/routes/tee/+error.svelte` here\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/len0xx/sveltekit-error-issue\r\n\r\nTo reproduce an issue, just clone the project and run:\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm run dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen go to http://localhost:5173/tee/error. \r\nWhat you will see is the contents of `src/routes/+error.svelte`. But I expect to see the contents of `src/routes/tee/+error.svelte` here\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.19 Ubuntu 22.10 22.10 (Kinetic Kudu)\r\n    CPU: (12) x64 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-12400F\r\n    Memory: 8.45 GB / 15.47 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.2.2 - /bin/bash\r\nBinaries:\r\n    Node: 18.7.0 - /usr/bin/node\r\n    npm: 9.1.1 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\nBrowsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 107.1.45.133\r\n    Chrome: 107.0.5304.121\r\n    Firefox: 107.0\r\nnpmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.90 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.567 \r\n    svelte: ^3.53.1 => 3.53.1 \r\n    vite: ^3.2.4 => 3.2.4\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7875/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
