But if I have a before navigate in a route. And then I redirect in the load function on the route we are navigating to. The beforeNavigate runs twice in the original route.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nIt's reproduced here:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-5ed6za?file=src/app.html\r\n\r\nI've made this example of the bug occuring.\r\nIf we are at the `/` route (Home) and then go to `/about` (About) \"BEFORE\" is only logged once.\r\nBut if we go back to `/` and then go to `/test` (Test) we are correctly redirected to `/about` but \"BEFORE\" is logged twice.\r\nThe console looks like this for the latter case:\r\n```\r\nBEFORE\r\nLOAD IN TEST\r\nBEFORE\r\n```\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.0 undefined\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 0 Bytes / 0 Bytes\r\n    Shell: 1.0 - /bin/jsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.2 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 7.17.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.87 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.539 \r\n    svelte: ^3.46.0 => 3.52.0 \r\n    vite: ^3.1.0 => 3.2.3\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThis is quite a serious bug for how we use `beforeNavigate` in our application.
