Thanks for looking into this. I suppose there are 3 cases here:\r\n\r\n1. pages\r\n1. page endpoints\r\n1. standalone endpoints\r\n\r\nGetting the content size for (1) pages is taken care of by `transformPageChunk` as you suggested. As for (3) standalone endpoints, since I am responsible for creating the whole `Response`, I can calculate content-length and set it myself inside the endpoint handler. However, I don't see a way to do it in (2) page endpoints, since only a POJO is returned.\r\n\r\nAs a tangent, I'm grateful for the thoughtful changes in #5748. I like the new distinction between standalone endpoints (returning a `Response`) and page endpoints (returning only data). I definitely had been conflating the 2 up to this point.

#5749.\r\n\r\nThis is just an idea; I don't know if it's the right one. In order to make it easier to determine response content length inside `handle`, for logging purposes, this adds a new `text(body)` helper similar to the `json(data)` helper. It returns a `Response` object with a `content-length` header, and uses it in favour of `new Response(...)` when generating pages and other responses.\r\n\r\nOne observation: it'd be nice if we could unit-test `Server` rather than having Playwright tests for the bulk of the tests in `server.test.js`. Might look into that separately.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit
