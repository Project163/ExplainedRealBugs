This returns a `200` response with the HTML of the page itself. Ideally, a `405` no action exists error would be returned.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-bk2z1s?file=svelte.config.js,src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.svelte\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.0 undefined\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 0 Bytes / 0 Bytes\r\n    Shell: 1.0 - /bin/jsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.2 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 7.17.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.90 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.571 \r\n    svelte: ^3.53.1 => 3.53.1 \r\n    vite: ^3.2.4 => 3.2.4\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7965/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7965/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
