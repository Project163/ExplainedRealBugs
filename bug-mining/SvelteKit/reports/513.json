A common use case is as follow: \r\n\r\n in a simple CRUD with the following pages :\r\n\r\n    /list\r\n    /list/[id]\r\n\r\nSay you have a delete button on the [id] page that calls a DELETE action at the same level, if you plan to invalidate then `goto(parent_page)` the [id] load function will get in-between a not found error (obviously). \r\n\r\n`goto(invalidateAll)` won't really work if you have unrelated parametrized load functions in previous segments of the URL (ie if you're using `depends` anywhere).\r\n\r\nYou can solve this by redirecting to the parent page on error in the load function but this doesn't feel right (one extra -and failed- request per deletion). \r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\n`goto( { invalidate: ['myidentifier'] } )`\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nI could redirect to some dummy invalidation page or add a query parameter that would trigger an invalidation in the list page but it feels complicated.\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10659/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10659/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
