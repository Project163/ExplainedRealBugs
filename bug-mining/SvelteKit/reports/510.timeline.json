Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12577/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12577/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15229116760,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c6DhcEszwAAAAOLueFY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/15229116760","actor":{"login":"zachstence","id":31896377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODk2Mzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31896377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence","html_url":"https://github.com/zachstence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6d8c109edbb1e5b938b8d56d41df5156aa8a7f6f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/evidence-dev/evidence/commits/6d8c109edbb1e5b938b8d56d41df5156aa8a7f6f","created_at":"2024-11-08T22:54:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/2468609116","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/12039#issuecomment-2468609116","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12039","id":2468609116,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c6TI_xc","user":{"login":"zachstence","id":31896377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODk2Mzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31896377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence","html_url":"https://github.com/zachstence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachstence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-11T16:44:51Z","updated_at":"2024-11-11T16:44:51Z","body":"I
