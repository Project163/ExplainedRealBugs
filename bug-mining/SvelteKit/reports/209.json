Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI have some code that I'd like to share between some SvelteKit endpoints and my service worker.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to import these modules in my service worker using a custom path alias (e.g. `import addOne from '$utils/addOne';`), then build the service worker with `vite build`, I get the following error --\r\n\r\n```\r\n[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import \"$utils/addOne\" from \"src/service-worker.ts\".\r\nThis is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.\r\nIf you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to\r\n`build.rollupOptions.external`\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tried doing as this error asked, but no luck!\r\n\r\nI've created this repo as a minimal reproduction: https://github.com/egargan/sveltekit-service-worker-alias-issue. \r\nClone it, install deps, then run `npx vite build` to see the error mentioned above.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the default `$lib` alias works!\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nI'd like custom aliases defined in `svelte.config.js` to be respected when building a service worker. `vite build` should output a service worker with the alias-imported modules bundled into it.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No
