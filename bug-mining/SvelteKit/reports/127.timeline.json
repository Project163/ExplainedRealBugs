since #6537 was merged, the only change this PR makes is to treat invalidation is equivalent to navigation for the purposes of `beforeNavigate`, `afterNavigate` and `navigating`. Leaving it here until we make a final decision, but there's some valid scepticism about whether this is the right move.\r\n\r\nOriginal PR message follows.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncloses #6517\r\ncloses #4383\r\ncloses #6498\r\ncloses #6375 \r\npossibly #4447 too?\r\n\r\nThis adds a `type` property to the `Navigation` object found in various places:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { beforeNavigate, afterNavigate } from '$app/navigation';\r\nimport { navigating } from '$app/stores';\r\n\r\nbeforeNavigate(({ from, to, type }) => {\r\n  console.log('beforeNavigate', type);\r\n});\r\n\r\nafterNavigate(({ from, to, type }) => {\r\n  console.log('afterNavigate', type);\r\n});\r\n\r\n$: console.log($navigation?.type);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe type is one of the following:\r\n\r\n* `load` — we just got here for the first time. `from` is `null` in this case\r\n* `link` — the user clicked a link\r\n* `goto` — the app called `goto` programmatically\r\n* `popstate` — the user hit the back/forward button, or we're traversing the history some other way\r\n* `invalidation` — the app called `invalidate(...)` or `invalidateAll()`. **This is a breaking change** — invalidations weren't previously treated as navigations\r\n* `unload` — the page is being unloaded because the user clicked an external link, or submitted a form, or reloaded the page, etc. `to` will be `null` in this case\r\n\r\nIn the `popstate` case, there's an additional `delta` property, where -1 means navigating back and +1 means navigating forwards (but this can be any non-zero integer).\r\n\r\nTodo\r\n\r\n* [ ] docs\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6522/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1235344774","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6517#issuecomment-1235344774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6517","id":1235344774,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5Jod2G","user":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-02T10:40:22Z","updated_at":"2022-09-02T10:40:22Z","body":"This is great!
