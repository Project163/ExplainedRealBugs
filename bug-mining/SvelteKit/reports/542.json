// Typeerror due cameFromRoute being a string\n      }\t\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\n\n```\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\n    OS: macOS 15.5\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M2 Pro\n    Memory: 86.91 MB / 16.00 GB\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 22.15.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.15.0/bin/node\n    npm: 10.9.2 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v22.15.0/bin/npm\n    pnpm: 10.12.3 - ~/Library/pnpm/pnpm\n  Browsers:\n    Brave Browser: 137.1.79.118\n    Chrome: 138.0.7204.169\n    Edge: 138.0.3351.95\n    Safari: 18.5\n```\n\n### Severity\n\nblocking an upgrade\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14048/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14048/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
