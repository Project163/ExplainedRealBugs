We don't want to encourage people to import things like `$src/hooks.js` or `$src/routes/__layout.svelte` — that would lead to people putting things in the wrong places just because they can.

We _could_ resolve other aliases based on `config.kit.vite.resolve.alias` or the `tsconfig`, but both of those have drawbacks, so having a single source of truth could be easier.\r\n\r\nThen again, I

Describe the problem\n\nNow to setup a custom alias we have to put it in both `tsconfig.json` and `svelte.config.js` (according to [FAQ](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/827d1623d64a9886032c8bfc8e2315420d1599d0/documentation/faq/50-aliases.md)). This is an extra hassle and unnecessary duplication of the same logic.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nSince `tsconfig.json` already extends `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` which is create by svelte kit, I propose to generate typescript paths based on vite aliases provided by `svelte.config.js`.\r\n\r\nSo, user writes:\r\n```js\r\nimport { resolve } from \"path\";\r\n\r\nconst config = {\r\n  ...\r\n  kit: {\r\n    ...\r\n    vite: () => ({\r\n      resolve: {\r\n        alias: {\r\n          $components: resolve(\"./src/components\")\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    }),\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the following is generated in `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json`:\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"$lib\": [\"src/lib\"], //These are already in place\r\n      \"$lib/*\": [\"src/lib/*\"],\r\n      \"$components\": [\"src/components\"], //These are generated\r\n      \"$components/*\": [\"src/components/*\"],\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nRight now, not only you have to specify your alias twice, but also forced to override `$lib` alias in your `tsconfig.json` since [paths don't merge](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/20110) (otherwise you get a compiler warning).\r\n\r\n`tsconfig.json`:\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"extends\": \"./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json\",\r\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n    \"paths\": {\r\n      \"$lib\": [\"src/lib\"], //We are forced to write these, despite already heaving them in .svelte-kit/tsconfig.json\r\n      \"$lib/*\": [\"src/lib/*\"],\r\n      \"$components\": [\"src/components\"],\r\n      \"$components/*\": [\"src/components/*\"],\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4774/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1112883614","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4734#issuecomment-1112883614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4734","id":1112883614,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5CVUGe","user":{"login":"Azarattum","id":43073346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDczMzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43073346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azarattum","html_url":"https://github.com/Azarattum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azarattum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azarattum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azarattum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azarattum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azarattum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azarattum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azarattum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azarattum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Azarattum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-29T05:14:14Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T05:14:14Z","body":"@Rich-Harris I just raised an issue on the same subject (https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4774) as this has been an annoyance to several of my projects...

PR implements `config.kit.alias`, as the proposed solution in #4734 describes.\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n```ts\r\nconst config = {\r\n  kit: {\r\n    alias: {\r\n      $utils: 'src/utils'\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- I would like some pointers/assistance with adding the new config property, I may have messed something up.\r\n- New tests need to be written and some existing ones need to be modified. **Before I go on with writing tests, I'd like feedback to the code itself**.\r\n- We should consider deprecating/removing `config.kit.files.lib` and having it be `config.kit.alias.$lib`, but `$lib` is special for packaging and other situations.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [X] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [X] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [X] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4964/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4964/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"paperclover","id":24465214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDY1MjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24465214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover","html_url":"https://github.com/paperclover","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paperclover/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-17T01:21:43Z","updated_at":"2022-05-17T01:21:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4716","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4716/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4716/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4716/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4716","id":1213653518,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c5IVuIO","number":4716,"title":"Only

Describe the problem\r\n\r\nCurrently, when you want to add aliases you need to add them in two places, namely  `svelte.config.js` and `tsconfig.json`, and also remember to always keep them in sync.\r\nSo, for example:\r\n`svelte.config.js`:\r\n```js\r\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */\r\nconst config = {\r\n    preprocess: preprocess(),\r\n    kit: {\r\n        vite: {\r\n            resolve: {\r\n                alias: {\r\n                    $components: path.resolve('./src/lib/components'),\r\n                    $actions: path.resolve('./src/lib/actions'),\r\n                    $common: path.resolve('./src/lib/common'),\r\n                    $stores: path.resolve('./src/lib/stores'),\r\n                },\r\n            },\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default config;\r\n```\r\nYou'll have to have:\r\n`tsconfig.json`:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"extends\": \"./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json\",\r\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"paths\": {\r\n            \"$components/*\": [\"src/lib/components/*\"],\r\n            \"$actions/*\": [\"src/lib/actions/*\"],\r\n            \"$common/*\": [\"src/lib/common/*\"],\r\n            \"$stores/*\": [\"src/lib/stores/*\"]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nActually, you also have to add the default `$lib` alias to your `tsconfig.json` as well, since otherwise SvelteKit will display a warning complaining about this. So it'll be more like:\r\n`tsconfig.json`:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"extends\": \"./.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json\",\r\n    \"compilerOptions\": {\r\n        \"paths\": {\r\n            \"$lib\":[\"src/lib\"],\r\n            \"$lib/*\":[\"src/lib/*\"],\r\n            \"$components/*\": [\"src/lib/components/*\"],\r\n            \"$actions/*\": [\"src/lib/actions/*\"],\r\n            \"$common/*\": [\"src/lib/common/*\"],\r\n            \"$stores/*\": [\"src/lib/stores/*\"]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is not exactly a great developer experience.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nSince we now have a `tsconfig.json` in the `.svelte-kit` directory, it would be nice if the aliases defined in `svelte.config.js` were automatically detected and added to the auto-generated `.svelte-kit/tsconfig.json` file, so as to eliminate the need for the developer to do this manually.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n###
