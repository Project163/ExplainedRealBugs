When I reload `/tests`, this error shows.\r\n\r\nBug could be in vite's dev server rather than Sveltekit directly, but it's certainly impacting sveltekit.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n- Clone https://github.com/qbunt/tests-route-sveltekit\r\n- Install deps\r\n- Run `npm run dev -- --open`\r\n- Click the `link to tests` link\r\n- See no error and the content of the `tests` page\r\n- Refresh the page\r\n- See 403 response regardless of a valid route\r\n<img width=\"662\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/187095/158630162-fa2c8e1d-33b1-4af8-8d14-95cc3a9612d0.png\">\r\n\n\n### Logs\n\n```shell\n403 Restricted\r\n\r\nThe request url \"/Users/qbunt/Desktop/test-svelte/tests\" is outside of Vite serving allow list.\r\n\r\n- /Users/qbunt/Desktop/test-svelte/static\r\n- /Users/qbunt/Desktop/test-svelte/src/lib\r\n- /Users/qbunt/Desktop/test-svelte/src/routes\r\n- /Users/qbunt/Desktop/test-svelte/.svelte-kit\r\n- /Users/qbunt/Desktop/test-svelte/src\r\n- /Users/qbunt/Desktop/test-svelte/node_modules\r\n\r\nRefer to docs https://vitejs.dev/config/#server-fs-allow for configurations and more details.\n```\n\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.3\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max\r\n    Memory: 6.59 GB / 64.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.0 - ~/Library/Caches/fnm_multishells/55751_1647444823499/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.17 - /opt/homebrew/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.3.1 - ~/Library/Caches/fnm_multishells/55751_1647444823499/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 96.1.32.115\r\n    Chrome: 99.0.4844.74\r\n    Chrome Canary: 98.0.4758.2\r\n    Edge: 99.0.1150.39\r\n    Firefox: 98.0.1\r\n    Firefox Developer Edition: 96.0\r\n    Firefox Nightly: 97.0a1\r\n    Safari: 15.4\r\n    Safari Technology Preview: 15.4\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.33 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.298 \r\n    svelte: ^3.46.0 => 3.46.4\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\nWhen working with the static adapter, after a build, the `tests` route renders as expected during a refresh.
