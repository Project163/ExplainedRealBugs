It would be nice to simply `return fail()` and do `instanceof ActionFailure`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction parse(value: T | null) {\r\n\tif (!value) {\r\n\t\treturn fail(400, { message: 'Too high' })\r\n\t}\r\n\t// ...\r\n\treturn value\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Action:\r\nconst result = parse('test')\r\nif (result instanceof ActionFailure) {\r\n\treturn result\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n- Creating my own class\r\n- Returning a result type like `{ value: T, error: null } | { value: null, error: string }`\r\n- Use the `Error` class `message` as an intermediate, if I only need an error string\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/12611/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
