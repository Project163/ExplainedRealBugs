Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n\r\n### Fixes #7496  \r\n\r\nThis PR splits the `get_aliases` function into two.

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThe [solution](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/pull/7745) to the duplicate content `svelte:head` element [bug](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/6463) (and also [this one](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/6463)) requires HTML comments to be present in order to function correctly. Many [minification tools strip HTML comments](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7493#issuecomment-1303218382), and as does CloudFlare by default in many environments.\r\n\r\nDuplicating the `head` element is a fairly insidious bug because it isn't immediately obvious that anything is wrong, but for our project (in SvelteKit) it decreased performance by loading analytics scripts multiple times. We also suspect that it may have broken some web indexing, but couldn't be sure.\r\n\r\nIf there is a better way to solve this than relying on comments, that would be great. I've marked the `Severity` as `annoyance`, but only because we have found a highly unsatisfactory workaround that I would rather not have in place long term.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nOne straightforward way to reproduce this would be to use the [reproduction repo](https://github.com/thousandsofraccoons/double-meta) provided in [this issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7493), which minifies the html response and strips comments: when comments are stripped, the duplicate header bug is present.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System

Status:\r\n\r\n🚀 : Ready\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n- Upgrades SvelteKit to version 1.0\r\n- Crazy that this ~netted 1 line~ reduced line count 😯\r\n\r\nThings to think about:\r\n- I removed the `loadImages` script from the build process, and everything still seems to work. I was wondering what the reason for it was before, if it was for an old SvelteKit bug or something to do with the Contentful image URLs? The reason I removed it is because I'd have to change the file paths it accesses since they're no longer valid. I _could_ do this though.\r\n- I switched to the SvelteKit Netlify adapter because I'm anticipating some need for server-side JS soon (viewing preview content). All of the old content on the site is still prerendered, but now the build will include server-side JS for use in the future.\r\n- For some reason the Netlify adapter is still able to deploy to Vercel... I have no idea why. Not a bad thing, just a thing.\r\n- Had to disable comment removal minification option because Svelte has [an issue](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7493#issuecomment-1303218382) with it.\r\n- I was able to simplify the use of the `<Head` component by having pages return load data called `title`, and the layout uses it for setting a global `<Head`. While this adds some indirection, I think it's fine because of how much it simplifies, and TypeScript + autocomplete makes `title` appear inside the return statements of `load` functions.\r\n- I had to pass the Contentful private environment keys into the `check` CI/CD jobs because they're statically replaced variables, so they have to be there for SvelteKit to successfully type check our app.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hack4impact-uiuc/website/issues/77/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hack4impact-uiuc/website/issues/77/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
