This resulted in the dynamic modules being typed like so:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndeclare module '$env/dynamic/public' {\r\n  let env: App.PublicEnv;\r\n}\r\ndeclare module '$env/dynamic/public' {\r\n  let env: App.PrivateEnv;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis forces users to explicitly type their data using the `App` types, which is annoying -- it's \"fake\" type safety -- nothing is guaranteeing those keys even exist on your env object.\r\n\r\nFor some reason (maybe I was tired?) I didn't see the obvious solution...\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\n```ts\r\ndeclare module '$env/dynamic/public' {\r\n  let env: {\r\n    PUBLIC_FOO: string | undefined;\r\n    PUBLIC_BAR: string | undefined;\r\n    [key: string]: string;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\ndeclare module '$env/dynamic/public' {\r\n  let env: {\r\n    PRIVATE_FOO: string | undefined;\r\n    PRIVATE_BAR: string | undefined;\r\n    [key: string]: string;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis still allows for arbitrary optional dynamic variables (such as feature flags or environment-dependent settings), but removes the need to use \"fake\" types to provide autocomplete.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6202/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6202/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
