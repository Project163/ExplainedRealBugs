The callback function has access to an `update` function which invokes the default form response behavior. The `update` function accepts options, but this doesn't seem to be in the Svelte documentation anywhere.\r\n\r\nIn order to know that you can, e.g. invoke update but not reset the form values (`update({ reset: false })`), you would have to check out the type hints in your code editor, or find out via 3rd party site. I personally discovered this very useful feature by way of [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75324846).\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nUpdate the [progressive enhancement](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/form-actions#Progressive-enhancement) or [enhance reference](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/$app-forms#enhance) pages to include a brief description of the `update` function options.\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13020/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
