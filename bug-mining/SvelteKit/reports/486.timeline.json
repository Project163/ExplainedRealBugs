SvelteKit automatically adding the origin to create absolute URLs for certain images, but not others, was a _huge headache_ getting started with Svelte Kit for a couple days as I figured out how to handle metadata for my images and when to include the origin for canonical URLs, icons, og image, etc and not knowing when and why Svelte Kit was magically doing stuff to some meta URLs, but not others...\r\n\r\nThe thought process as a dev is: `npm run dev` shows relative URLs in dev console (makes sense because of Vite), `npm run build` outputs relative URLs (okay good to know), but running the production app has absolute URLs  in dev console _for some_ meta URLs (!) automatically added, but not all(!) and inspecting the actual source (cmd+option+u in Chrome) shows _relative_ paths in the production HTML. \r\n\r\nI ended up with double origins in my URLs before realizing SK adds them in some places automatically. \r\n\r\nTLDR I'd recommend not making this permanent in SK. It's worth revisiting if the browser bug warranting this has been resolved because the fix makes SK's DX unpredictable for URL handling. Or at the very least, should be documented. \r\n\r\n**IMO, for a real project, it doesn't make sense to include any assets, like `apple-touch-icon`, modern SVG favicon, etc directly from app.html using the static dir--other than the one `favicon.ico` for old RSS readers basically--**, which might make this issue null.\r\n\r\nA better approach is to include them in a `<svelte:head> ... </svelte:head>` in a main `+layout.svelte`, so they can be imported via Vite, have file names hashed and far futures cache headers used, which may help address any browser 404 issue. Only `favicon.ico` should be unhashed for old clients.\r\n\r\nHere's a really great, well-researched article on the required metadata today's for favicon and touch icons for today's browsers: https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs\r\n\r\n> I am getting lots of 404 errors for apple-touch-icon files as (some?) browsers try to load it from deeper paths.\r\n\r\nCurious if your paths start with `/` like `/image.png` or are `image.png`? The latter could cause issues.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1626570251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasongitmail","id":50032291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMDMyMjkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50032291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasongitmail","html_url":"https://github.com/jasongitmail","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasongitmail/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasongitmail/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasongitmail/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasongitmail/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasongitmail/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasongitmail/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasongitmail/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasongitmail/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasongitmail/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1628625065","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/10317#issuecomment-1628625065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10317","id":1628625065,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5hEtip","user":{"login":"Serator","id":625005,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTAwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/625005?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Serator","html_url":"https://github.com/Serator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Serator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Serator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Serator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Serator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Serator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Serator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Serator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Serator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Serator/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-10T09:57:35Z","updated_at":"2023-07-10T09:57:35Z","body":"I'm using the same method described by @jasongitmail, because I've encountered a problem that when posting a message to Slack, Slack uses `apple-touch-icon` for the site icon in the message preview and can't get it from `<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"%sveltekit.assets%/apple-touch-icon.png\" />` from `src/app.html`.\r\n\r\nP.S.

Describe the problem\r\n\r\nKnowing what favicon (ICO, PNG, SVG), apple-touch-icons, manifest, which resolutions, etc is a pain for modern developers and hard to keep up with.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nIf SvelteKit included boilerplate assets (using SvelteKit logo) in the Skeleton project, it would indicate suggested branding assets and smooth this aspect for future devs.\r\n\r\nI found a solution for myslelf in this article, referenced by Chris Coyier.\r\nhttps://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs Updated, based on the fix mentioned in [this comment](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/10317#issuecomment-1628625065) to prevent Chrome downloading both `ico` and `svg` favicons.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"icon\" href=\"/favicon.ico\" sizes=\"32x32\"><!-- 32×32 PNG -->\r\n<link rel=\"icon\" href=\"/icon.svg\" type=\"image/svg+xml\">\r\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"><!-- 180×180 PNG-->\r\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.webmanifest\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// manifest.webmanifest\r\n{\r\n  \"icons\": [\r\n    { \"src\": \"/icon-192.png\", \"type\": \"image/png\", \"sizes\": \"192x192\" },\r\n    { \"src\": \"/icon-512.png\", \"type\": \"image/png\", \"sizes\": \"512x512\" }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe article has really good research and reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe extra benefit is these can be put into suggested locations--e.g. `static/favicon.ico` and linked from within app.html, and the rest in a main `+svelte.layout` imported via Vite to receive hashed file names and far futures cache headers, likely imported from somewhere like `$lib/assets/images/foo.png`. It teaches good conventions and will help improve SK's already-good DX.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nnice to have\r\n\r\n### Additional

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked.
