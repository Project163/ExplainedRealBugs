If you'd like to prerender only some pages, **you will need to use a different adapter together with [the prerender option]** (https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options#prerender).\r\n\r\nAccording to https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-static#turn-off-prerendering\r\n\r\n> When operating in SPA mode, you can omit the [prerender](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options#prerender) option from your root layout (or set it to false, its default value), and only pages that have the prerender option set will be prerendered at build time.\r\n[...]\r\n> You can also add turn off prerendering only to parts of your app, if you want other parts to be prerendered.\r\n\r\nPractical tests (sveltekit v1) show, that using adapter-static with prerendering only some of pages works ok (i.e. when only CSR is used and some of pages use URL params, it cannot be prerendered probably but works fine with fallback page configured). If it is supported officially [adapter-static manual](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/adapter-static/README.md) should probably be updated (and conflicting information mentioned above should be removed).\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nRead manual.\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nany\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8396/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
