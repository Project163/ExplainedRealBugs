How to migrate\r\n\r\n## browser.hydrate / browser.router / prerender.default\r\n\r\n`hydrate` and `router` have been replaced with [`csr`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options#csr). See #6446 for more info.\r\n\r\nRemove these options from your `svelte.config.js` and export them from your root `+layout.js` or `+layout.server.js` instead:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nconst config = {\r\n\tkit: {\r\n-\t\tbrowser: { hydrate: false, router: false },\r\n-\t\tprerender: { default: true }\r\n\t}\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// src/routes/+layout.js\r\nexport const csr = false;\r\nexport const prerender = true;\r\n```\r\n\r\n(For now, you will need a `+layout.svelte` alongside your `+layout[.server].js` — this [will be fixed soon](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5967).)\r\n\r\nYou can also set these options at lower layouts or inside pages if you want.\r\n\r\nFor other changes around `prerender` see this PR: #6392\r\n\r\n## handle: resolve(event, { ssr: ... })\r\n\r\nThe `ssr` option was removed from the `resolve` function that is passed into the `handle` hook. Set it at the appropriate `+layout.js` or `+layout.server.js` or `+page.js` or `+page.server.js`. The following example shows how to turn off SSR for all admin pages:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nexport function handle({ event, resolve }) {\r\n   return resolve(event, { \r\n-      ssr: !event.url.pathname.startsWith('/admin')\r\n   });\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// src/routes/admin/+layout.js\r\nexport const ssr = false;\r\n```\r\n\r\n# PR description\r\n\r\nCloses #6356\r\n\r\nCan't believe how little code the actual change is 😄 \r\n\r\nDuring implementing this, I realized a shortcoming of the current implementation: If `+page.js` accesses a browser global, for example\r\n```js\r\ndocument;\r\nexport function load() {}\r\n```\r\n..then this will fail on the server with an error, even if you did set `ssr` in `handle`. To change this behavior we would need to lazy-load `shared` just like we do with `component` already - should we make this change? If yes, should I incorporate it into this PR?\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6197/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":2,"-1":6,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6197/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7290551975,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5Q0UAlzwAAAAGyjP6n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7290551975","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9552a457f972ffcc6782789fc53891a54431a565","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/9552a457f972ffcc6782789fc53891a54431a565","created_at":"2022-08-30T20:01:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-30T20:03:50Z","updated_at":"2022-08-30T20:03:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6446","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6446/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6446/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6446/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/6446","id":1356241367,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c4-Ep2p","number":6446,"title":"replace

To migrate, remove the old options and replace them with the new option.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n// +layout.js\r\n- export const router = false;\r\n- export const hydrate = false;\r\n+ export const csr = false;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following permutations are possible:\r\n- old: `router = true` / `hydrate = true` -> new: `csr = true` (this is the default, so you probably don't need to set this)\r\n- old: `router = false` / `hydrate = false` -> new: `csr = false` (no JS is loaded on the client)\r\n- old: `router = false` / `hydrate = true` -> new: `csr = true` + set `data-sveltekit-reload` if you want native navigations\r\n- old: `router = true` / `hydrate = false` -> new: `csr = true` (this was a buggy setting)\r\n\r\n# PR description\r\n\r\ncloses #6436\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n* [x] update `create-svelte` templates\r\n* [x] docs\r\n* [x] noisy error if a page has `hydrate` or `router` exports\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6446/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6446/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7291358097,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5Q0UAlzwAAAAGymUuR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7291358097","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-30T22:28:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7291358209,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5Q0UAlzwAAAAGymUwB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7291358209","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f1f8d3355add5fe1431d6f1cab9ab92992d35ea3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/f1f8d3355add5fe1431d6f1cab9ab92992d35ea3","created_at":"2022-08-30T22:28:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
