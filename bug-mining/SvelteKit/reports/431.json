Describe the problem\r\n\r\nThis issue is to track support for Chrome's `Document Transitions API` AKA `Shared Element Transitions` on navigations inside sveltekit\r\n\r\nMore info about Chrome's feature and status can be found here:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/WICG/shared-element-transitions/blob/main/developer-guide.md](https://github.com/WICG/shared-element-transitions/blob/main/developer-guide.md)\r\n[https://github.com/WICG/shared-element-transitions/blob/main/explainer.md](https://github.com/WICG/shared-element-transitions/blob/main/explainer.md)\r\n[https://chromestatus.com/feature/5193009714954240](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5193009714954240)\r\n\r\nThe only reason this is hard to implement in userland is because the time between beforeNavigate and afterNavigate could be considerable considering sveltekit may have to make an http request in the middle of it or importing other modules.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\nProvide hooks like `afterNavigate` and `beforeNavigate` but that triggers just before and after the dom updates.\r\nThat way the user can call `document.createDocumentTransition` on their own\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\nProvide a property in the `sveltekit.config.js` file to optionally enable this feature.\r\nThis way is the simple one, sveltekit just have to call `document.createDocumentTransition` before new navigations updates the dom, update the dom and then resolve the promise.\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nnice to have\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No
