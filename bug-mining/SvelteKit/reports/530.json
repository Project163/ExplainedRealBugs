We need to implement a multi-domain, multi-prefix localization system that allows flexible domain/language combinations.\r\n\r\nExample configuration:\r\n- Domains: example.com, example.uk, example.gr, example.fr\r\n- Localizations: en-gb, el-gr, en-gr, fr-fr, en-fr\r\n\r\nDomain/prefix mappings:\r\n\r\n```\r\nel-gr:\r\n- example.com/el-gr/\r\n- example.gr/\r\n\r\nen-gr:\r\n- example.com/en-gr/\r\n- example.gr/en/\r\n\r\nen-gb:\r\n- example.com/\r\n- example.uk/\r\n```\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nModify the Reroute function to return `MaybePromise<void | string>` and update its implementation in `server/response.js` and `client/client.js`. \r\n\r\nA proof-of-concept implementation: https://github.com/nikosgram/kit/commit/70d808e6bfe3273d575d0a93c36b96335234a5ac\r\n\r\nI would appreciate feedback on this approach to ensure I'm not overlooking any potential issues or better alternatives.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\ni cannot use SvelteKit without it\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13176/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
