Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7979/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7977960115,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5X2duezwAAAAHbhgKz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7977960115","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5d9951ea3449ba2282097763a5545db4253a23f1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/5d9951ea3449ba2282097763a5545db4253a23f1","created_at":"2022-12-07T13:42:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1341127108","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7926#issuecomment-1341127108","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7926","id":1341127108,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5P7_nE","user":{"login":"bjon","id":280413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDQxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon","html_url":"https://github.com/bjon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-07T15:23:01Z","updated_at":"2022-12-07T15:23:21Z","body":"@Rich-Harris
