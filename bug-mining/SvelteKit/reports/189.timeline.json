Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWhen using a simple fetch to an endpoint like so:\r\n```\r\nfetch('/login', {method: \"POST\", body: new URLSearchParams('key', 'value')})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is sent by Chrome and Safari as a POST request with the following content-type header:\r\n```\r\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/kit/src/runtime/server/page/actions.js checks the content-type value by splitting on `; ` (note the space). \r\n\r\nTherefore I cannot use the above fetch call because the endpoint returns:\r\n> Actions expect form-encoded data (received application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8)\r\n\r\nI think this is a bug and that you should instead

happens only during initial hydration, i.e. the server produces the SSR and then `load` reruns on the client for hydration. During that, the response header is no longer present so it's treated as text instead of json. The header is no longer present because of no headers being serialized by default. You can fix this by adding the following to your `hooks.server.js`:\r\n```js\r\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Handle} */\r\nexport function handle({ event, resolve }) {\r\n\treturn resolve(event, {\r\n\t\t// you can also seralize other headers here if needed\r\n\t\tfilterSerializedResponseHeaders: (name, value) => name === 'content-type'\r\n\t});\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is also mentioned here in the docs: https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#input-methods-fetch\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm wondering how to make this error more discoverable, and if it makes sense to have some subset of serialized response headers by default. cc @Conduitry @Rich-Harris who might have an opinion on this. In #6569 where it was implemented this exact case was discussed, and it looks like it added some code to surface this error - so now I'm wondering why that error isn't triggered here. Update: That check was moved in #7113 and seems to no longer work now.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1274445962/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7561156031,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c5TD8uRzwAAAAHCrhW_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7561156031","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-11T10:03:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7561156038,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5TD8uRzwAAAAHCrhXG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7561156038","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-11T10:03:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7561156047,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c5TD8uRzwAAAAHCrhXP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7561156047","actor":{"login":"Conduitry","id":16696352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njk2MzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16696352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry","html_url":"https://github.com/Conduitry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-11T10:03:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7561156048,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5TD8uRzwAAAAHCrhXQ","u

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit
