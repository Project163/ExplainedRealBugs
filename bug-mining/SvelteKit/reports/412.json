Reverting to 1.20.2 solves the problem. Since 1.20.3 and 1.20.4 were related to tiny-glob, and builder uses `glob` to locate files for precompression, I'm sure the two are related.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nI believe any build with `precompress: true` is going to fail, but here is my repo: https://github.com/txstate-etc/dosgato-admin. \r\n- git clone\r\n- Change package.json to un-pin the sveltekit version \r\n- `npm upgrade`\r\n- `npm run build`\r\n- inspect the `build` directory\r\n- observe that there are no .br or .gz files.\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\nThe broken and non-broken build logs are identical. Neither mentions doing any compression.\n```\n\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 13.3.1\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max\r\n    Memory: 192.86 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 19.7.0 - /opt/homebrew/bin/node\r\n    npm: 9.6.4 - /opt/homebrew/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 114.0.5735.133\r\n    Firefox: 114.0.1\r\n    Safari: 16.4\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nblocking an upgrade\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10184/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
