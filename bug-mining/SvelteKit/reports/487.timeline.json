#13095\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the RegExp to ensure that routes such as `/[[optional]]/(group)` are treated the same as `[[optional]]`. Previously, `/[[optional]]/(group)` was being treated the same as `/` which is incorrect since it has an optional segment. It wasn't recognised as `/[[optional]]` because the RegExp didn't consider the route group preceding it (it only looked for the end of the string).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked. PRs without this option may be closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13099/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/2513968381","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/13095#issuecomment-2513968381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/13095","id":2513968381,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c6V2Bz9","user":{"login":"dominikg","id":611613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMTYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/611613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg","html_url":"https://github.com/dominikg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dominikg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-03T09:21:15Z","updated_at":"2024-12-03T09:21:36Z","body":"possible
