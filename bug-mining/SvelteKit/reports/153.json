But if you open http://127.0.0.1:5173/foo (which doesn't exist) you will see instead the same message but now with the status code 500.\r\n\r\nI would expect to still see the same 401 code there, as I have not modified it anywhere. Or I would expect to see a 404? But definitely not a 500.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.6\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max\r\n    Memory: 717.94 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 3.5.1 - /opt/homebrew/bin/fish\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.17.0 - ~/Library/pnpm/node\r\n    npm: 8.15.0 - ~/Library/pnpm/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Safari: 16.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.73\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.481\r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.50.1\r\n    vite: ^3.1.0 => 3.1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nannoyance\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
