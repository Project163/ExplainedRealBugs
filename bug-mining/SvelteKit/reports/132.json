We need a way to set a cookie inside an action that can be read during the subsequent `load`, and while we _could_ make it work with `setHeaders` it would involve some very unexpected behaviour (we would basically need to intercept `request.headers.get('cookie')` and sub in a value that included the `set-cookie`, which is a bad amount of magic).\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nWe add a new `cookies` interface:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// src/routes/login/+page.server.js\r\nexport const actions = {\r\n  default: ({ fields, cookies }) => {\r\n    const user = await db.getUserFromEmail(fields.get('email');\r\n\r\n    // ...some logic happens...\r\n\r\n    cookies.set('sessionid', await db.createSession(user), {\r\n        maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 // stay logged in for 30 days\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n> `export const actions` is described in https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/discussions/5875#discussioncomment-3540263\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// src/routes/+layout.server.js\r\nexport async function load({ cookies }) {\r\n  // this value could come from `request.headers.get('cookie')` or the previous `cookies.set` call\r\n  const sessionid = cookies.get('sessionid');\r\n  const user = await db.getUserFromSessionId(sessionid);\r\n  return { user };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is an experimental standard [`CookieStore`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore) interface, but I don't think we should use it. It's designed for use in browsers, which means all the methods are asynchronous — needlessly, in our case — and there's a `change` event that doesn't really make sense in our context. More important, it doesn't expose an `httpOnly` option (because that wouldn't make sense for client-side JavaScript), whereas I think `httpOnly` is the only sensible default.\r\n\r\nThe proposed API:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface Cookies {\r\n  delete(name: string): void;\r\n\r\n  get(name: string, opts: {\r\n    decode: (input: string) => string\r\n  }): string;\r\n\r\n  set(name: string, value: string, opts?: {\r\n    expires?: Date;\r\n    maxAge?: number;\r\n    domain?: string;\r\n    path?: string;\r\n    secure?: boolean;\r\n    httpOnly: boolean;\r\n    sameSite: 'strict' | 'lax' | 'none'; // can only be `none` with `secure: true`,\r\n    encode: (input: string) => string\r\n  }); void;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're familiar with the [cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie) package, this API will seem very familiar — it's what we'd use under the hood.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nRelying on people populating `event.locals` in actions, which feels unnecessarily restrictive.\r\n\r\nIntercepting (and changing) `request.headers.get('cookie')`, which feels like too much magic.\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6540/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6540/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
