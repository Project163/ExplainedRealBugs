Instead, the error gets serialized and the build continues.\n\nNormally if a route fails to prerender, it results in the `prerender.handleHttpError` function being called, which defaults to throwing an informative error. I'm not sure whether we want to reuse that function (perhaps with different values) or create a new one.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-oy33huhv?file=.svelte-kit%2Foutput%2Fprerendered%2Fdata%2F_app%2Fremote%2F19aeq9f%2Foops\n\n### Logs\n\n```Shell\n\n```\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nlatest\n```\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/14242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
