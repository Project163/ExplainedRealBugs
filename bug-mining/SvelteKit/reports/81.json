Also presumably, the most common source of \"long\" `load`s are network calls. If all of my loads are _blazingly fast_ -- as the kids like to say -- waterfalling isn't that big of a deal, but if I throw a few network calls in there, suddenly that whole \"running in parallel\" thing is pretty awesome.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I'm finding that I often have to throw the \"running in parallel\" benefits out the window because I need to be able to deeply merge `data`. For example, if I have a `layout` key in data which itself is an object being listened to by the root `+layout.svelte` through `$page.data`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// /routes/foo/+layout.ts\r\nexport const load: LayoutLoad = () => {\r\n  return {\r\n    layout: {\r\n      showFooter: true,\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n} \r\n\r\n// /routes/foo/bar/+layout.ts\r\nexport const load: LayoutLoad = () => {\r\n  const things = await some_stuff_we_dont_want_to_happen_serially();\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    layout: {\r\n      showPotato: true,\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// /routes/+layout.svelte\r\n<script lang=\"ts\">\r\n  import { page } from '$app/stores';\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<Potato show={!!$page.data?.layout?.showPotato} />\r\n<slot />\r\n<Footer show={!!$page.data?.layout?.showFooter} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee the footgun? `/routes/foo/bar/+layout.ts` will completely overwrite the `layout` key in `data` because it's shallow-ly merged. In order to fix it, we have to change it to:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// /routes/foo/bar/+layout.ts\r\nexport const load: LayoutLoad = async ({ parent }) => {\r\n  const things = await some_stuff_we_dont_want_to_happen_serially();\r\n  const { layout } = await parent();\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    layout: {\r\n      ...layout,\r\n      showPotato: true,\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, ugh, now that load has to `await parent` when _all I want to do_ is deeply merge the objects! The load itself doesn't actually have any dependency upon the parent at all.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nThankfully, the solution is pretty simple. I can't take credit -- @Rich-Harris came up with it when we were whiteboarding in the maintainers' chat. He's smart like that. The solution is to allow data resolution to occur _after_ all `load`s have finished. Rendering doesn't start until all `load`s have resolved anyway, so there's no issue here. Essentially, we allow `load`s to run in parallel, but data resolution to run as a (partial or complete) waterfall afterwards (_if_ a developer needs it to):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// /routes/foo/bar/+layout.ts\r\nexport const load: LayoutLoad = () => {\r\n  const things = await some_stuff_we_dont_want_to_happen_serially();\r\n\r\n  // data, in this case, is the merged contents of all datas prior to this `load`, including any `load`s that also return this kind of function\r\n  return (data) => ({\r\n    layout: {\r\n      ...data.layout,\r\n      showPotato: true,\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows the `load` to run in parallel, but for its returned _data_ to depend upon prior `load`s' data (which is returned, presumably, _after_ all of their time-consuming network activities have completed).\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nJust get over it and deal with shallow-ly merged `$page.data` forever. Not a big fan. 😆 \r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6017/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6017/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
