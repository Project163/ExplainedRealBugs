#4038.\r\n\r\nCredit to @aolose for the first version of this (https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/4139). I tried to work on that branch but things had diverged too much, and I was concerned that the implementation came with fair bit of intrinsic complexity. This implementation is slightly less sophisticated — if an endpoint falls through during client-side navigation, Kit won't find which endpoint _actually_ matches and allow the client to short-circuit the next attempt — but it's less code and easier to follow. Fallthroughs are something of an edge case so I'm okay with them not being fully optimised.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist!

Describe the bug\n\nProblem happens when you have multiple dynamic routes at the same level. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[page]/index.js\r\n[page]/index.svelte\r\n[project]/index.js\r\n[project]/index.svelte\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior is that you first check whether the `[page]` is a valid page. If yes, you return props and render the page. If NOT you should be able to return `{ fallthrough: true }` and kit will process the next route, `[project]`, in this case.\r\n\r\nHowever it doesn't work when you use endpoints shadowing the route. It works as expected when using `load()` function within the svelte component file. It works on first render or full page refresh. However it breaks when navigating. SvelteKit somehow gets stuck on `[page]/index.svelte` component and renders itself instead of falling through to the next one.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/lemmon/svelte-kit-fallthrough-endpoint-bug\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 11.6.3\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6500 CPU @ 3.20GHz\r\n    Memory: 203.37 MB / 16.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 14.17.1 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.5.1 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 88.1.19.86\r\n    Chrome: 98.0.4758.109\r\n    Firefox: 97.0.1\r\n    Safari: 15.3\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: 1.0.0-next.30 => 1.0.0-next.30 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.0.0-next.291 => 1.0.0-next.291 \r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.46.4\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nblocking an upgrade\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4212/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6185447342,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5EUtkmzwAAAAFwrm-u","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6185447342","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-04T14:14:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6185447660,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5EUtkmzwAAAAFwrnDs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6185447660","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4c5322aa4936b2c0e29d902a698932d0a69e53d9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/4c5322aa4936b2c0e29d902a698932d0a69e53d9","created_at":"2022-03-04T14:14:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
