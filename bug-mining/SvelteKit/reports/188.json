This would currently involve copying everything under `/[locale]` to `/` as well. Using `/[...locale]` does not work either, because a `/[...locale]/[...slug]` would not match correctly for many cases.\r\n\r\n2) When using `adapter-static` and pre-rendering all routes, only routes picked up through crawling links will be rendered behind `/[locale]`. Using `kit.prerender.entries: [\"*\", \"/de/something\"]` will only pre-render `/de/something` but nothing else.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\n1) Add optional parameters with e.g. `[locale?]` syntax\r\n\r\n2) Allow more wildcards in `kit.prerender.entries`, like `/de/*`\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5072/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5072/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
