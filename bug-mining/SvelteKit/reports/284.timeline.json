During testing, `options.ssr` is `false`, but obviously in most cases we're not loading from a `routes` folder... I'm not really sure what the best way to fix this is -- we don't have access to the import chain, so we can't check the parents for `{test|spec}` files. We might be able to say \"if these test environment variables are set, don't throw\", but I think we'd probably still want this behavior in integration tests and even some unit tests, so I don't love that solution. \r\n\r\n@Rich-Harris The only immediate solution I can think of is to undo your work here and go back to the more-complicated solution we had before that allowed us access to the module graph during dev.

can confirm I am also having this issue in my `.test.ts` files running through `vitest`. \r\n\r\nFunny thing is that the file im testing (`user.ts` - that exports a bunch of functions that do simple

throws.\r\n\r\nLuckily in my case there is a workaround - I can move the component files out of the `server` directory.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to importing from `$env/static/private` I replaced it in my `setupTests.ts` file with:\r\n```ts\r\nvi.mock('$env/static/private', () => import.meta.env);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope that

is a naive but effective fix for #8180. When running Vitest, both `process.env.VITEST` and `process.env.TEST` are `true`, meaning we can simply ignore illegal imports during unit testing.\r\n\r\nI opted for `TEST` over `VITEST` because it will then work with any unit testing framework that works with Vite, as long as they adhere to this convention.\r\n\r\nI think it's totally fine to skip detection during tests, since it'd be vanishingly rare that something was explicitly testing for that behaviour. The error will show up soon enough in dev, and the build will fail.\r\n\r\nOne gotcha is that if you do `TEST=true npm run dev` it will disable illegal import detection during dev (not build), which I think is probably a fine trade-off.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8365/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8365/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8170009667,"node_id":"COE_lADOEiPr8c5ZUZNUzwAAAAHm-HRD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8170009667","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-06T15:05:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1373747648","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/8180#issuecomment-1373747648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8180","id":1373747648,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5R4bnA","user":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-06T15:06:15Z","updated_at":"2023-01-06T15:06:15Z","body":"I
