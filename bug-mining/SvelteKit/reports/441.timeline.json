early this week.\r\n\r\n> We could forbid javascript: URLs and it would fix the vulnerability without (really) being a breaking change\r\n\r\n👍 That would definitely be a good step to take, I guess there's zero good reasons why you would ever want to `goto` a `javascript:` URL.\r\n\r\nHowever with this specific vulnerability we accidentally created, even just the ability to create a link that forwards the user to any external site after logging in is also quite critical in itself, of course. The user would first click on a trustworthy link on the correct domain, and then potentially get forwarded to a phishing scam without realizing the domain had changed.\r\n\r\nMaybe blocking external links could be opt-in per call to `goto` alternatively, so that there's at least an easy way to secure navigations when passing user-editable strings as the path. It turns out that securing that isn't super trivial - you need to guard against strings including `protocol:`, but also double-slashes at the beginning (`//wikipedia.com`), plus possibly more patterns I'm not aware of.

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or
