Describe the problem\r\n\r\nI'll just describe my situation: My SvelteKit site is supposed to be localised into multiple (predefined) languages. To archive that I created this SvelteKit route layout: `/src/pages/[...locale=locale]/[about=about].svelte`. Implementing the `locale` slug was pretty easy thanks to the recent addition of matchers (In this case my matcher only returns true if [ \"\", \"de\", \"lv\" ] includes `locale`), but now comes the tricky part: I obviously also want to localise the urls of individual pages, but this isn't possible without knowing the `locale` slug.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\n`match()` could receive a second argument, called `params`. `params` would be an object with the same layout as `event.params` in `handle()`.\r\n```js\r\nexport function match(param, params) {\r\n    return {\r\n        \"\": \"about\",\r\n        \"de\": \"uber\",\r\n        \"lv\": \"par\"\r\n    }[params.locale] === param\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nCurrently it should be possible to create a store to make inheriting possible.

#5072\r\n\r\nI chose the `[[optional]]` syntax for alignment with the wider ecosystem/how other frameworks do it.\r\nProbably needs some more tests, also wondering if we should have a check that tells you that you have both a required and optional param matching the same, which is forbidden - update: decided against that, we don't do that for conflicting required params, too, and it's probably too hard to find out taking into account `+server.js` and differing sub routes.\r\nApart from that it's ... done?
