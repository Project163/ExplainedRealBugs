When built, the release apps use `tauri:` as the internal URL protocol. Because of a [recent SvelteKit PR](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5726), navigation causes a complete page refresh instead of the expected routing.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nCreate a SvelteKit + Tauri app with any SvelteKit version after or including [1.0.0-next.398](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/releases/tag/%40sveltejs%2Fkit%401.0.0-next.398). Navigation causes a complete page refresh. (Manual navigation using `goto` still works correctly.)\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.5.1\r\n    CPU: (16) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 134.39 MB / 16.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.4.0 - ~/Library/pnpm/node\r\n    npm: 8.12.1 - ~/Library/pnpm/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Safari: 15.6.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-static: 1.0.0-next.38 => 1.0.0-next.38 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.0.0-next.398 => 1.0.0-next.398 \r\n    svelte: ^3.49.0 => 3.49.0 \r\n    vite: ^3.0.0 => 3.0.0\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThis issue persists in the most recent version of SvelteKit.","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6496/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6496/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
