I need to generate `TypeScript` or `JSDoc-JavaScript` code.\r\nI'm doing this by calling some helper functions that output the code in the specific syntax or nothing if it doesn't match the configured syntax.\r\n\r\nI write normal `JavaScript` code and then sprinkle in those functions where needed. Not the prettiest code but it works ^^\r\n\r\nSee an example [here](https://github.com/ivanhofer/typesafe-i18n/blob/main/packages/generator/src/files/generate-adapter-svelte.ts#L34)\r\n[generated output](https://github.com/ivanhofer/typesafe-i18n/blob/main/packages/generator/test/generated/adapter-svelte/svelte.expected.ts) for `TypeScript` \r\n[generated output](https://github.com/ivanhofer/typesafe-i18n/blob/main/packages/generator/test/generated/adapter-svelte-jsdoc/svelte.expected.js) for `JavaScript`\r\n\r\nAn improved solution would probably be something like this where you write e.g. a function in an abstract form and let it generate the correct syntax:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction({\r\n   name: 'myFunction',\r\n   params: [{ id: 'string' }],\r\n   returns: 'string',\r\n   body: 'return id'\r\n)\r\n\r\n// generated TypeScript code\r\nconst myFunction = (id: string): string=> {\r\n   return id\r\n}\r\n\r\n// generated JavaScript code\r\n/**\r\n * @param { string } id\r\n * @return string\r\n */\r\nconst myFunction = (id) => {\r\n   return id\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut such an approach would make it harder for new contributions because they would need to learn how to use such an abstraction.\r\n\r\nBut writing it in plain `TypeScript` and `Javascript` and having to keep two different examples in sync would also be a challenging task.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1086221241/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ivanhofer","id":21335119,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzM1MTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21335119?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanhofer","html_url":"https://github.com/ivanhofer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanhofer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanhofer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanhofer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanhofer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanhofer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanhofer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanhofer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanhofer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivanhofer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6364909333,"node_id":"MIE_lADOEiPr8c5GZoaczwAAAAF7YM8V","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6364909333","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-04T17:22:45Z","milestone":{"title":"whenever"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-26T19:19:08Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T19:19:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/2712","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/2712/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/2712/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/2712/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/2712","id":1040333296,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c4-Ajnw","number":2712,"title":"TypeScript

The big challenge is that we ideally want your settings to be persisted (rather than the page loading then there being a big layout shift while it switches from JS mode to TS mode), which implies we can't use prerendering.

adding a toggle that shows snippets either in TS or JS code. The toggle is implemented using CSS and a blocking script which adds a class to the html tag, which makes the correct one of the two snippets appear. The TS versions are generated from the JS versions through a transformation step.\r\nCloses #4452\r\n\r\nMarked as draft because ~`$app/X` imports are not recognized in the TS version for some reason; and~ I don't know where to place the toggle. It's at the top of the navigation sidebar for testing, but that obviously isn't a good solution. I see basically two options:\r\n1. Some fixed place on the page so you toggle JS/TS globally\r\n2. Each snippet that has a TS version gets some toggle icon on the top right. It would also toggle all other snippets to TS so you don't have to do it for each snippet. One way to achieve this with the given setup would be to put both the JS and generated TS version into one code snippet, separating them through some special comment. Then when marked invokes the `code` method we separate them again, transform them independently and then wrap them inside some block which would have the toggle visible if JavaScript is enabled in the browser.\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7182/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":6,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7566874841,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5GZoaczwAAAAHDBVjZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7566874841","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-11T22:48:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7566874963,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5GZoaczwAAAAHDBVlT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7566874963","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"366c1a9ee7f736d5735fa517af660cf21784f4b7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/366c1a9ee7f736d5735fa517af660cf21784f4b7","created_at":"2022-10-11T22:48:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
