This isn't a problem with `trailingSlash: \"never\"`.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n### `trailingSlash: \"always\"`\r\n- [Demo](https://repro-prerender-404-k64onxso1-drzax.vercel.app/)\r\n- [Code](https://github.com/drzax/repro-prerender-404)\r\n\r\nThere's a PR in that repo where the only change is to set `trailingSlash: \"never\"`:\r\n- [Demo](https://repro-prerender-404-6hgfib8uc-drzax.vercel.app/)\r\n- [Code](https://github.com/drzax/repro-prerender-404/pull/1/files)\r\n\r\nThis doesn't appear to affect the root path (presumably because it always has a trailing slash), but all other paths appear to be affected. \r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.6\r\n    CPU: (16) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9880H CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n    Memory: 51.70 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.1.8 - /usr/local/bin/bash\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.8.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.19.2 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 109.0.5414.10\r\n    Edge: 107.0.1418.52\r\n    Firefox: 106.0.5\r\n    Firefox Developer Edition: 107.0\r\n    Safari: 16.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.88\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-vercel: ^1.0.0-next.81 => 1.0.0-next.81\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.551\r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.53.1\r\n    vite: ^3.1.0 => 3.2.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nserious, but I can work around it\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nIn my use case I can set trailingSlash to 'never', but can easily imagine a scenario where that might not be possible or desirable. \r\n\r\nVercel build output where trailing slash is 'always'\r\n<img width=\"647\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/596563/202841798-0c897766-4e9a-44c6-950d-7d2227b4adb1.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nVercel build output where trailing slash is 'never'\r\n<img width=\"647\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/596563/202841765-05f80e2f-b363-4c14-a607-8929eb9e74f2.png\">\r\n\r\nThis may be related to (or even the same bug as) #6236, but I couldn't tell for sure so thought I'd submit this anyway — apologies if it's a duplicate.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7725/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
