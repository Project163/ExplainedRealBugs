Setting this to `false` for testing purposes reveals a different problem then: If a link is followed, the page is duplicated below the original page and the original page is \"frozen\" (no links are followed, that happens in the duplicated page below). If then the router is also disabled through `router: false` it works as expected. But users could enable the router or the hydration on a page-by-page basis (like the about page in the example app during dev) which makes this buggy behavior reoccur.\r\n\r\nThis reveals the following problem: \r\n\r\nThe missing ability to tell Vite(-plugin-svelte) to compile some components with the hydratable option and others without it. Right now the `hydratable` compiler option is defined through `browser.hydrate`. \r\n- If this is set to `false` but some pages have `hydrate = true`, then the output for this specific Svelte component is wrong. This gets worse because sub components may be used on different pages and it's not easy to find out which components are used on non-hydratable pages only and therefore could also omit the `hydratable` option. Furthermore, since Svelte starts at the root for hydration and calls children recursively, we need to have the root to be hydratable, else child component's hydrate methods are never called - but setting the root to hydratable throws the error mentioned here.\r\n- The problem is the other way around if `browser.hydrate = true` but some pages have `hydrate = false` - though its not as bad as it only produces unnecessary hydration code.\r\n\r\nI wonder what's the best approach to solving this. I don't see a world where we can tell vite-plugin-svelte to compile specific components differently, since the `hydratable` option can be based on a dynamic value, so we would have to evaluate stuff before compiling. So the easiest option seems to always add the `hydratable` option when compiling Svelte components regardless of `hydrate`, or if we want to be more sophisticated, run a string regex on all page files to check if anyone has the `hydratable` option and if not we can safely turn `hydratable` off.\r\n\r\nI also wonder how many people actually use the `browser` options - or rather, use the specific combination of `hydrate: false, router: true` - since this bug seems pretty apparent, yet this only has one thumbs up.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1188911205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1189072532","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4382#issuecomment-1189072532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4382","id":1189072532,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5G386U","user":{"login":"benmccann","id":322311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/322311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/benmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-19T13:43:33Z","updated_at":"2022-07-19T13:43:33Z","body":"Yeah,
