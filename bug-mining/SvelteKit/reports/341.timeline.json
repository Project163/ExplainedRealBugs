If I remember @Rich-Harris correctly the idea is to give this into the hands of the user - it may not always be desireable to do a full page refresh even if the site is outdated, you may lose all your client side data unexpected.\r\nThis isn't clear from the documentation though, which suggests that this just works automatically somehow. So I think the solution is to enhance the documentation here, clarifying that and giving a short example how you could achieve this, like\r\n```js\r\n// +layout.svelte\r\nimport { beforeNavigate } from '$app/navigation';\r\nimport { updated } from '$app/stores';\r\n\r\nbeforeNavigate(({ willUnload, to }) => {\r\n  if ($updated && !willUnload && to?.route.url) {\r\n    location.href =

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8941/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8941/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8470461529,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5csZnjzwAAAAH44PxZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8470461529","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-08T16:00:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8470461594,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5csZnjzwAAAAH44Pya","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/8470461594","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a402d50b33eba2a937d09e635275c319061ce678","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/a402d50b33eba2a937d09e635275c319061ce678","created_at":"2023-02-08T16:00:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
