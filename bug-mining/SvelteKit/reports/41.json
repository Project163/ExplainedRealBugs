Describe the bug\n\nIn order to return binary data (eg. a generated Image) from a Netlify function, the data must be converted to a `base64` encoded string with the proper content-type.\r\n\r\nThis is done in [`handler.js`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/adapter-netlify/src/handler.js#L21), but the condition that checks for `Uint8Array` will always fail, as the response type changed with #3384 \r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, there is currently no way to determine the \"type\" from the response, other than looking at the `content-type` header and using something like [`is_text`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/827d1623d64a9886032c8bfc8e2315420d1599d0/packages/kit/src/runtime/server/endpoint.js#L30)\n\n### Reproduction\n\nHere's a minimal setup: https://github.com/bummzack/sveltekit-netlify-binary-response\r\n\r\nThere's twice the same code running in a SvelteKit Endpoint ([`image.png`](https://github.com/bummzack/sveltekit-netlify-binary-response/blob/main/src/routes/image.png.js)) and a separate [Netlify function](https://github.com/bummzack/sveltekit-netlify-binary-response/blob/main/netlify/functions/test.js).\r\n\r\nThe SvelteKit endpoint does not encode the image properly and it won't be displayed: \r\nhttps://elated-knuth-7439db.netlify.app/image.png\r\n\r\nThe direct implementation as a separate Netlify function works as expected:\r\nhttps://elated-knuth-7439db.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/test\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nLocal system is irrelevant, since the issue doesn't occur locally.\r\n\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.30 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.288 \r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.46.4\n```\n\n\n###
