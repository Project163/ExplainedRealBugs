Navigating between them shows some data lingers across the groups, but then disappears if you refresh the page. It does it in both dev and build mode. Probably no biggie but who knows ... if someone is iterating keys or something it might bite them?\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/304910/186784633-00098258-cd9d-4193-870b-fd32b066d8d7.mov\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/CaptainCodeman/sveltekit-routing-layouts\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.5.1\r\n    CPU: (6) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8500B CPU @ 3.00GHz\r\n    Memory: 4.63 GB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.3.1 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 102.1.39.111\r\n    Chrome: 104.0.5112.101\r\n    Chrome Canary: 107.0.5261.0\r\n    Firefox: 103.0.2\r\n    Safari: 15.6.1\r\n    Safari Technology Preview: 16.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.66 \r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: 1.0.0-next.87 => 1.0.0-next.87 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.442 \r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.49.0 \r\n    vite: ^3.0.4 => 3.0.9\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6300/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6300/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
