think it's only for SPA mode but I'm not 100% sure on that. \r\n\r\nYour suggested solution is basically what I was thinking too, since it doesn't appear to be doing anything that actually needs to start the `Server` and instead just needs to share a couple bits of code from the SSR render pipeline. I'm saying that without really knowing what's going on under the hood though.\r\n\r\nThe current behavior is to take the `app.html`, and do an empty SSR render whose body just inserts the `<script>` tag to download the main JS file and call start.\r\n\r\nLooking at the output on my project at work, I see these replacements:\r\n\r\n`%svelte.head%` becomes\r\n\r\n```html\r\n    <meta http-equiv=\"content-security-policy\" content=\"\">\r\n\t<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/_app/start-75b9d96b.js\">\r\n\t<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/_app/chunks/index-7a365041.js\">\r\n\t<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/_app/chunks/index-d3785d77.js\">\r\n\t<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/_app/chunks/preload-helper-e4860ae8.js\">\r\n\t<link rel=\"modulepreload\" href=\"/_app/chunks/singletons-d1fb5791.js\">\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then `%svelte.body%` is replaced by\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\t\t<script type=\"module\" data-hydrate=\"45h\">\r\n\t\timport { start } from \"/_app/start-75b9d96b.js\";\r\n\t\tstart({\r\n\t\t\ttarget: document.querySelector('[data-hydrate=\"45h\"]').parentNode,\r\n\t\t\tpaths: {\"base\":\"\",\"assets\":\"\"},\r\n\t\t\tsession: {},\r\n\t\t\troute: true,\r\n\t\t\tspa: true,\r\n\t\t\ttrailing_slash: \"never\",\r\n\t\t\thydrate: null\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t</script>\r\n```","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1089158546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dimfeld","id":1369558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjk1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1369558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld","html_url":"https://github.com/dimfeld","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimfeld/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1090972645","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4492#issuecomment-1090972645","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4492","id":1090972645,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5BBuvl","user":{"login":"coryvirok","id":769323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTMyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/769323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coryvirok","html_url":"https://github.com/coryvirok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coryvirok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coryvirok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coryvirok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coryvirok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coryvirok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coryvirok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coryvirok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coryvirok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coryvirok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-07T01:01:27Z","updated_at":"2022-04-07T01:01:27Z","body":"FWIW, I ran into this today as well but I'm using the node adaptor. I don't have any prerenderable routes, (I've never set the `prerender` module export or set the default to `true` to attempt to prerender everything.)\r\n\r\nThe code I have in hooks.ts is pretty simple.
