In fact we execute a full navigation — it's just that most of the steps are a no-op, since the code is already loaded and the data is guaranteed to remain valid.\r\n\r\nBailing out of the navigation in `popstate` if the URL is the same, apart from the the hash, would save SvelteKit from doing a bunch of unnecessary work, but more importantly it would fix the inconsistency. The alternative way to solve the inconsistency would be to _also_ trigger callbacks when the link is clicked, but I think consistently _not_ calling them is preferable.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-4stmd9?file=src%2Froutes%2F%2Blayout.svelte,src%2Froutes%2F%2Bpage.svelte&terminal=dev\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.5.1\r\n    CPU: (10) arm64 Apple M1 Max\r\n    Memory: 670.72 MB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.17.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.17.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.17.0/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.15.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v16.17.0/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 109.0.5414.87\r\n    Chrome Canary: 111.0.5553.0\r\n    Firefox: 109.0\r\n    Safari: 15.6.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^1.0.0 => 1.0.2 \r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare: ^1.0.0 => 1.1.0 \r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare-workers: ^1.0.0 => 1.0.6 \r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-netlify: ^1.0.0 => 1.0.5 \r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: ^1.0.0 => 1.1.4 \r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-static: ^1.0.0 => 1.0.5 \r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-vercel: ^1.0.0 => 1.0.5 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.0.0 => 1.2.9 \r\n    svelte: ^3.55.1 => 3.55.1 \r\n    vite: ^4.0.4 => 4.0.4\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\nI'm inclined to fix this before continuing with #8710, since otherwise that PR will be more complex than it needs to be.","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8726/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
