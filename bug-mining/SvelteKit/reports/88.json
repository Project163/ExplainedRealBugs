This results in the following behaviour:\r\n\r\n1. Link gets clicked\r\n2. URL in address bar changes\r\n3. Content of page stays unchanged\r\n\r\nSetting `export const hydrate = false` on a page does interestingly not break the router.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\n[🚩 Link to a demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/sveltejs-kit-template-default-q36fqu?file=svelte.config.js)\r\n\r\n1. Start the dev server and click on the links to observe the broken router\r\n2. Comment the `browser: { hydrate: false },` line in `svelte.config.js` and restart the dev server to see the router working again.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\nWhen clicking on link (browser console):\r\n```\r\n[HMR][Svelte] Unrecoverable HMR error in <Root>: next update will trigger a full reload\r\nUncaught (in promise) Error: options.hydrate only works if the component was compiled with the `hydratable: true` option\r\n    at Object.claim [as l] (root.svelte?
