For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpx changeset` and following the prompts.

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [ ] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4972/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6631189279,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5IMwlIzwAAAAGLP-sf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6631189279","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-18T10:34:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6631189622,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5IMwlIzwAAAAGLP-x2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6631189622","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8dd0e36b15bd62e27d78a73d63f2d232d347d9f3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/8dd0e36b15bd62e27d78a73d63f2d232d347d9f3","created_at":"2022-05-18T10:34:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1134836127","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4685#issuecomment-1134836127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4685","id":1134836127,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5DpDmf","user":{"login":"john-michael-murphy","id":23287496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjg3NDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23287496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-michael-murphy","html_url":"https://github.com/john-michael-murphy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-michael-murphy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-michael-murphy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-michael-murphy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-michael-murphy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-michael-murphy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-michael-murphy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-michael-murphy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-michael-murphy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/john-michael-murphy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-23T15:42:56Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T15:42:56Z","body":"Thanks,

Describe the problem\r\n\r\nWe've struggled for some time with the challenge of embedding sveltekit \"interactives\" within the React ecosystem of The New York Times. This is of particular issue on our homepage (https://www.nytimes.com/) where svelte-kit apps are embedded like so many raisins in the pudding, and mounting them to the wrong node can blow out the rest of the page DOM. \r\n\r\nThere's a fair amount of fancy-footwork going on on the homepage, so we don't always have control over where scripts are mounted on the page (they are sometimes moved around for various performance reasons). \r\n\r\nThere have been some solutions— via https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4685  and https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4685 —which have worked in the past, but unfortunately, those solutions are no longer in more recent vintages of sveltekit. (I believe that the data attribute in question has[ moved on](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4685#issuecomment-1480298337)?)\r\n\r\nWe're currently stuck in an older vintage of sveltekit , because of this, which is a shame, as there are a number of new features we'd like to take advantage of! \r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nWe'd like to figure out a durable solution for the use-case above; it appears possible that we can update this ourselves via the suggestion [here](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4685#issuecomment-1106741548) but have had some trouble making that work. A pointer in the right direction, if that's the appropriate avenue, would be helpful! \r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\ni cannot use SvelteKit without it\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/10411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
