Describe the bug\r\n\r\nBasically, we have this `svelte.config.js`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-node';\r\n\r\nconst config = {\r\n    kit: {\r\n        adapter: adapter(),\r\n        paths: {\r\n            base: '/basepath'\r\n        },\r\n    }\r\n};\r\nexport default config;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we now run `svelte-kit build`, it produces this folder structure (partly):\r\n```\r\nbuild\r\n    client\r\n        _app\r\n            ...\r\n    server\r\n        ...\r\n    static\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe problem now is that the browser is not able to fetch the files in `client` and `static`. The node server returns status code `404` for these files.\r\n\r\nThe browser requests the files like this: `http://localhost:3000/basepath/_app/...`.\r\n\r\nIf we manually modify the folder structure to this (manually add a `basepath` folder in `client` and `static`) it works fine.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild\r\n    client\r\n        basepath\r\n            _app\r\n                ...\r\n    server\r\n        ...\r\n    static\r\n        basepath\r\n            ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems that the `adapter-node` forgets to take `paths.base` into account for the static files.\r\n\r\nBy the way: If I start the build with `svelte-kit preview`, it works fine. Just starting it with `node build` does not work.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nI created a simple demo app based on the `npm init svelte@next` command.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vekunz/svelte-paths-base-demo\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nbasepath:1 GET http://localhost:3000/basepath 404 (Not Found)\r\nbasepath:9 GET

Severity\r\n\r\nblocking all usage of SvelteKit\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nIt seems that in my example app moving the static files in a `basepath` subdirectory does not work also.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3726/reactions","total_count":31,"+1":27,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":4},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/3726/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1173064295","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4528#issuecomment-1173064295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4528","id":1173064295,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5F64pn","user":{"login":"nikhil-advait","id":2145732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDU3MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2145732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhil-advait","html_url":"https://github.com/nikhil-advait","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhil-advait/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhil-advait/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhil-advait/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhil-advait/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhil-advait/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhil-advait/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhil-advait/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhil-advait/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikhil-advait/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-03T11:28:24Z","updated_at":"2022-07-03T11:28:24Z","body":"Issue

previous PR (#312) was made with the target of rewriting the docs in SvelteKit. It quickly became outdated and was only targeting the docs, so this PR supersedes it since it started from a fresh SvelteKit template and targets the entire app (not just docs).\r\n\r\n# Important tasks\r\n\r\nThe migration is large and some of the tasks may be split into other smaller PRs. The general outline of the tasks is as follows:\r\n\r\n- [x] Move all files to the correct locations in SvelteKit convention, fixing imports and layout props accordingly\r\n- [x] Remove Custom Elements support (SvelteKit is just not ready for them yet, and they weren't even working properly)\r\n- [x] Replace any Sapper reference with SvelteKit\r\n- [x] Fix GitHub Actions and pre-commit hooks\r\n- [x] Investigate why some `:global` selectors are not working as they should\r\n- [ ] Figure out what to do with theming and SCSS variables (related to #181 - should probably convert/open a discussion)\r\n\r\n# Additional tasks\r\n\r\nThese are the nice-to-haves that theoretically shouldn't block the migration to SvelteKit, but also make use of some features that were not possible/easy before.\r\n\r\n- [x] Migrate everything to TypeScript\r\n- [x] Turn off router and/or hydration for pages that don't need them\r\n      Hydration is required for all pages (at the very least, for the \"Components\" dropdown to work), and in that case there is no compelling reason to disable the router.\r\n- [x] Remove deprecated interfaces (only `right` and `top` props in `Dropdown`)\r\n- [ ] Update documentation\r\n  - [ ] Theming\r\n  - [ ] Migration\r\n  - [ ] Installation\r\n  - [ ] Changelog\r\n\r\n# Blocking issues\r\n\r\n- ~~The PR is currently blocked by sveltejs/kit#4528 and the `{base}/...` workaround is not practical. Some links cannot be transformed that way (ex: ones inside CHANGELOG.md). Since `<base href=\"/\" />` is allowed (and actually fixes the problem), I'm wondering why `base: '/'` is not allowed.~~\r\n  **Update**: This turned out to be feasible. I was initially under the impression that `kit.paths.base` would add the `base` tag as Sapper did, but that turned out to not be the case. It was definitely tiresome but possible to update all URLs everywhere.\r\n\r\n# Other issues\r\n\r\n- Forwarded slots (`<slot name=\"loading-options\" slot=\"loading-options\">`) are detected as taking a slot prop called `slot` in the generated types.\r\n- Svelte Language Server (VS Code extension) does not understand import assertions (`import pkg from './package.json' assert { type: 'json' }`) even with latest Node.js installed\r\n  **Update**: Doesn't matter any more since I moved the package import to `vite.config.js`\r\n\r\nCloses #311\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/illright/attractions/issues/349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/illright/attractions/issues/349/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7022291375,"node_id":"LE_lADOEiPr8c5HIX3qzwAAAAGij6mv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7022291375","actor":{"login":"benmccann","id":322311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/322311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/benmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-19T16:33:27Z","label":{"name":"p1-important","color":"2C3488"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"benmccann","id":322311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/322311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/benmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-19T22:46:36Z","updated_at":"2022-07-19T22:46:36Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5601","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5601/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5601/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/5601/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/5601","id":1308554768,"node_id":"PR_kwDOEiPr8c47mZcm","number":5601,"title":"set
