Describe the problem\n\ni like to have a seperate tsconfig file for my svelte code to isolate it from the rest of the project, however `svelte-package` does not seem to have an option to specify the path to the tsconfig.json\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\na `--tsconfig` option like in `svelte-check`\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\ni think it currently gets confused when there are multiple tsconfigs in the project. see
