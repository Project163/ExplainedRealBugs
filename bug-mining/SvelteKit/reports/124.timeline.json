your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nLayouts cannot cache the return value of their load function, as seen in the [docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#loading-output-maxage). If the function fetches an endpoint it will be called each time a link is clicked or prefetched. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n`load()` function in a `__layout.svelte` can return a `maxage` property to cache its return value, just like indexes can do. \r\n\r\n**Workaround** : return a context in the layout load function then use it along maxage in each children indexes. \r\n \r\nWith this simple structure, 2 main pages containing 2 tabs each (meaning each sibling tabs share the same data), the parent layout seems like a good place to fetch this data: \r\n\r\n```\r\n├── cat\r\n│   └── __layout.svelte ---> fetching data.json\r\n│   ├── data.json.js\r\n│   ├── general\r\n│   │   └── index.svelte\r\n│   ├── details\r\n│   │   └── index.svelte\r\n├── dog\r\n│   └── __layout.svelte ---> fetching data.json\r\n│   ├── data.json.js\r\n│   ├── general\r\n│   │   └── index.svelte\r\n│   ├── details\r\n│   │   └── index.svelte\r\n```\r\nI would love to be able to cache both data.json from the layouts. Navigating from `cat/xxx` to `dog/xxx` would not trigger a fresh fetch beyond the first visit. \r\n \r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- understanding the reasons behind `[maxage] only applies to page components, not layout components.` \r\n- trying cumbersome combinations of indexes and layouts until it works \r\n- building a side cache system  \r\n\r\n**How important is this feature to you?**\r\nI can live without it especially because the workaround is easy, if not feasible I feel like the docs should explain why in that case. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/1515/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/1515/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1128125532","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4625#issuecomment-1128125532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4625","id":1128125532,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5DPdRc","user":{"login":"Conduitry","id":16696352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njk2MzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16696352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry","html_url":"https://github.com/Conduitry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-16T20:54:39Z","updated_at":"2022-05-16T20:54:39Z","body":"If possible, we should also ensure that any `etag` returned in these responses is manually added as `if-none-match` in the first request to a given URL, so we can also take advantage of that type of caching.

Describe the problem\n\n`fetch` is great, but it's common to need a more powerful abstraction when loading data — a GraphQL client, or a custom `api.get('endpoint')` helper, or even just something that adds some logging around the fetch. \r\n\r\nRight now that's somewhat cumbersome, because in order to make credentialled fetches during SSR, you need the instance of `fetch` that was passed into `load`. So you have to pick between these two monstrosities:\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<script context=\"module\">\r\n  import * as api from '$lib/api';\r\n\r\n  export async function load({ fetch }) {\r\n    const data = api.get(fetch, 'endpoint');\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<script context=\"module\">\r\n  export async function load({ stuff }) {\r\n    const data = stuff.api.get('endpoint');\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt gets worse if you need to pass `page` or `session` around for logging purposes.\r\n\r\nThe reason we have to do this is that the global `fetch` (supplied by `node-fetch`, in environments that don't natively support it) has no concept of credentials. A request for the `/account` page receives cookies; those cookies need to be forwarded when the page's `load` makes a request for the `/account.json` data that powers it, and the load-specific `fetch` argument makes that possible.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if using an abstraction around `fetch` was less cumbersome.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nJust like `onMount` registers a callback with the component that is currently initialising, we could introduce a function that makes the arguments to the current `load` invocation available to a function that gets called during that invocation. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// src/lib/api.js\r\nimport { getLoadArguments } from '$app/load';\r\n\r\nconst base = import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL;\r\n\r\nexport async function get(endpoint) {\r\n  const { fetch, page, session } = getLoadArguments();\r\n\r\n  const start = Date.now();\r\n  const url = `${base}/${endpoint}`;\r\n  const res = await fetch(url);\r\n  const name = session.user ? session.user.name : 'anonymous user';\r\n  console.log(`fetched ${url} from ${page.path} for ${name} in ${Date.now() - start}ms`);\r\n\r\n  return res;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<script context=\"module\">\r\n  import * as api from '$lib/api';\r\n\r\n  export async function load() {\r\n    const data = api.get('endpoint');\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function (hopefully we can come up with a better name than `getLoadArguments`) would only work during the invocation of a `load`; if called at any other time, it would throw an error.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6461/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7307967984,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5H1WjCzwAAAAGzlr3w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7307967984","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-01T19:13:15Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7307967991,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5H1WjCzwAAAAGzlr33","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7307967991","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ed6c3aa62d7d6098ba37d4fe4e3eacdf5aece80e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/ed6c3aa62d7d6098ba37d4fe4e3eacdf5aece80e","created_at":"2022-09-01T19:13:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Conduitry","id":16696352,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njk2MzUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16696352?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry","html_url":"https://github.com/Conduitry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Conduitry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-23T22:20:17Z","updated_at":"2022-11-23T22:20:17Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7790","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7790/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7790/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7790/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7790","id":1462475087,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c5XK5lP","number":7790,"title":"Server

Describe the bug\n\nIf I have cache headers set in my server load function\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport async function load(params) {\r\n\tconsole.log('LOADING');\r\n\r\n\t// const val = params.url.searchParams.get('val');\r\n\tconst val = params.url.search;\r\n\r\n\tconst result = {\r\n\t\tsearchProps: 'Value ' + val + ' ' + ' CACHE TEST VALUE === ' + i++\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\tparams.setHeaders({\r\n\t\t'cache-control': 'max-age=60'\r\n\t\t//Vary: 'Cookie'\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\treturn result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe headers work, and the page is cached, but if I start on this page, browse elsewhere, and then hit the back button, the loader re-runs.\r\n\r\nThe reason appears to be that the initial load of my site renders the entire page (which does have the correct headers), but subsequent navigations fetch a __data.js with the right url attached, so browsing back to it fetches that, which isn't (yet) cached.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThe minimal repro is here: https://github.com/arackaf/booklist/tree/special/bug-repro/svelte-kit\r\n\r\nthe directory above that has a huge project around it, but that directory I've linked to contains a minimal SvelteKit app that reproduces this (ostensible) bug.\r\n\r\nIt's currently deployed here: https://booklist-svelte-kit.vercel.app/\r\n\r\nAs you navigate, you'll see fresh calls to fetch __data.json, even when you click back to the starting page, which, again, is not (yet) cached. \n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.6\r\n    CPU:
