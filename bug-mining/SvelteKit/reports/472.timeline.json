#8957 one of the desired outcomes was that the framework code would have its own chunk with a stable hash for better caching, but that didn't really happen because the client imports something that references version, through `__sveltekit/environment` for created_updated_store and version hash through `__sveltekit/path`, which meant that when the developer changes their app code and increments/changes the version it'd also change the above mentioned modules and subsequently most chunks with the framework code\r\n\r\nIn this PR the version is injected in generateBundle once the chunk hashes have already been calculated so that just changing the version doesn't affect the hashes for chunks without any actual code changes\r\n\r\nfixes #12260\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [ ] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. Changesets that add features should be `minor` and those that fix bugs should be `patch`. Please prefix changeset messages with `feat:`, `fix:`, or `chore:`.\r\n\r\n### Edits\r\n\r\n- [x] Please ensure that 'Allow edits from maintainers' is checked.
