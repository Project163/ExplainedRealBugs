For best results, use the `fetch` that is passed to your `load` function: https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#making-fetch-requests\r\n\r\nThis is triggered by a simple fetch('/api/test') from +page.svelte, *after* page load, so to reproduce place such a fetch() call in to a button click.\r\n\r\nI am facing the exact same issue as in the mentioned in this stackoverflow link: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74700331/how-to-fetch-endpoint-data-in-sveltekit-after-initial-load\r\n\r\nSidenote: Other than stated on stackoverflow, changing the GET request into PUT does not avoid the message.\r\nSidenote 2: In the stackoverflow comments it is assumed to be a bug / false positive.\r\nSidenote 3: Yes, as stated in the comments, it might be necessary to make the browser reload the page to trigger this.\r\n\r\nSummary: There seems to be NO way at all to fetch() currently without getting this message repeatedly.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nSorry, no full demo code repository yet, but this explains it all in detail incl. code:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/74700331/how-to-fetch-endpoint-data-in-sveltekit-after-initial-load\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 6.0 Gentoo Linux\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8350U CPU @ 1.70GHz\r\n    Memory: 12.92 GB / 15.51 GB\r\n    Container: Yes  [WRONG REPORT?
