Invalidated resources remain invalid until the next navigation.\r\n\r\nIf `invalidateAll` has marked all dependencies invalid, further invalidations of any resource will rerun any `load` function. This condition remains until the next navigation.\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nA demonstration application is at https://github.com/davideaster/sveltekit-invalidations .
