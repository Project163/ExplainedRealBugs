Other headers seem easy, just add them back.

If the parent `+layout.server.js` changed, or your `+page.server.js` depends on `url`, setting cache headers would result in wrong cache hits.

If I'm understanding correctly this seems to solve my issue/goal precisely. In a real world scenario I wouldn't expect a visitor to refresh the page/start a new session and even if they I think it's fine to not use the browser cache.\n\nBut I'm still wondering if this works per page/route? For instance there may be some pages that I would like to be \"refreshed\" each time (although I guess it might be possible to manually trigger an update onmount for example each time the page is visited).

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nFor example, setting the cache here has no effect. \r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const load: PageLoad = async ({ fetch, setHeaders }) => {\r\n    const res = await fetch(`/api/users`);\r\n\r\n    if (!res.ok) throw error(res.status);\r\n\r\n    const users: UserV2[] = await res.json();\r\n\r\n    setHeaders({\r\n        'cache-control': 'max-age=86400',\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n        users,\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe it's because the initial request to the page contains \"Cache-Control: max-age=0\"?\r\n\r\nSo the current behavior is that even if I set the \"cache-control\" header, the request is always processed by the server (instead of being served by disk/memory cache).\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour is that the request is served from cache after being cached (obviously)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't really debug \"cache-control\" using node.new 🤔 The network panel doesn't give me access to the

Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7532/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7754700992,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5Q6yEKzwAAAAHON1jA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7754700992","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-07T17:11:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7754701010,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5Q6yEKzwAAAAHON1jS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7754701010","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b6b76bc46f4ede094e0df85110bb2392d637b994","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/b6b76bc46f4ede094e0df85110bb2392d637b994","created_at":"2022-11-07T17:11:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"arackaf","id":11261266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjYxMjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11261266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arackaf","html_url":"https://github.com/arackaf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arackaf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arackaf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arackaf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arackaf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arackaf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arackaf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arackaf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arackaf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arackaf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-23T05:55:30Z","updated_at":"2022-11-23T05:55:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7778","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7778/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7778/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7778/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7778","id":1461075668,"node_id":"I_kwDOEiPr8c5XFj7U","number":7778,"title":"Cache

Describe the bug\n\nThis issue\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6477#issuecomment-1256601175 \r\n\r\ndescribed a bug with server load functions not being appropriately cacheable. Rich closed it as fixed, describing behavior I'm exactly looking for: that cache headers sent down would control ttl for that url alone, and would be overridable with SvelteKit's standard invalidate functions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I'm having trouble getting this to work. \r\n\r\nMy +page.server.ts looks like this\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nlet i = 0;\r\n\r\nimport type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';\r\n\r\n// @ts-ignore\r\nexport async function load(params) {\r\n\tconsole.log('LOADING');\r\n\r\n\t// const val = params.url.searchParams.get('val');\r\n\tconst val = params.url.search;\r\n\r\n\tconst result = {\r\n\t\tsearchProps: 'Value ' + val + ' ' + i++\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\tparams.setHeaders({\r\n\t\t'cache-control': 'max-age: 20000'\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\treturn result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then I navigate to different querystrings for that page with \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a href=\"/?val=1\">1</a>\r\n<a href=\"/?val=2\">2</a>\r\n<a href=\"/?val=3\">3</a>\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThe minimal repro is here: https://github.com/arackaf/booklist/tree/special/bug-repro/svelte-kit \r\n\r\nthe directory above that has a huge project around it, but that directory I've linked to contains a minimal SvelteKit app that reproduces this (ostensible) bug. \r\n\r\nIt's currently deployed here: https://booklist-svelte-kit.vercel.app/\r\n\r\nAs you navigate, you'll see fresh calls to fetch __data.json, even though it should be cached \n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nBased on the comment here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/6477#issuecomment-1256644295\r\n\r\nit would seem like `invalidate(identifier)` would override cached results from a server load function. I'm having trouble reproducing that, though.\r\n\r\nMy server file looks like this\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nlet i = 0;\r\n\r\nimport type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';\r\n\r\n// @ts-ignore\r\nexport async function load(params) {\r\n\tconsole.log('LOADING');\r\n\r\n\t// const val = params.url.searchParams.get('val');\r\n\tconst val = params.url.search;\r\n\r\n\tconst result = {\r\n\t\tsearchProps: 'Value ' + val + ' ' + ' CACHE TEST VALUE === ' + i++\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\tparams.setHeaders({\r\n\t\t'cache-control': 'max-age=60'\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\tparams.depends('search:main');\r\n\r\n\treturn result;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand my svelte page looks like this, in part \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a href=\"/?val=A\">1</a>\r\n<a href=\"/?val=B\">2</a>\r\n<a href=\"/?val=C\">3</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nClicking around those pages does properly cache (check the CACHE TEST VALUE) - but clicking the invalidate button does not seem to work well at all. It seems to usually reload the current page, but other pages remained cached, and what's more, if I navigate *back* to the page I was on when I clicked invalidate, I get the old cached data, not the new data that was sent the moment I clicked invalidtae. Actually ... clicking invalidate seems to just pull cached data :\\ \r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n\r\nThe minimal repro is here: https://github.com/arackaf/booklist/tree/special/bug-repro/svelte-kit\r\n\r\nthe directory above that has a huge project around it, but that directory I've linked to contains a minimal SvelteKit app that reproduces this (ostensible) bug.\r\n\r\nIt's deployed here: https://booklist-svelte-kit.vercel.app/\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n```Shell\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.6\r\n    CPU: (16) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9980HK CPU @ 2.40GHz\r\n    Memory: 149.78 MB / 16.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.2 - /usr/local/Cellar/nvm/0.38.0/versions/node/v16.14.2/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.17 - /usr/local/Cellar/nvm/0.38.0/versions/node/v16.11.1/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.18.0 - ~/Documents/node_modules/.bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 107.0.5304.110\r\n    Firefox: 107.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.89 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.557 \r\n    svelte: ^3.44.0 => 3.53.1 \r\n    vite: ^3.1.0 => 3.2.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nblocking all usage of SvelteKit\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7784/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7784/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
