Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [X] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [X] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [X] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\nNote that master does not current pass `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`. These changes do not cause any additional failures.\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [X] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpx changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4437/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4437/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1076801575","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/4435#issuecomment-1076801575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4435","id":1076801575,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5ALrAn","user":{"login":"cmcculloh-kr","id":8006971,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDY5NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8006971?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcculloh-kr","html_url":"https://github.com/cmcculloh-kr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcculloh-kr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcculloh-kr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcculloh-kr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcculloh-kr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcculloh-kr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcculloh-kr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcculloh-kr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcculloh-kr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcculloh-kr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-23T20:43:57Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T20:43:57Z","body":"@benmccann
