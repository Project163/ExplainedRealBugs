And an event _imo_ is the whole function when it's called.\r\n\r\nYou can think of a request handler (either in an endpoint, or the main `handle` hook) as being sort of analogous to a DOM event listener:\r\n\r\n```js\r\naddEventListener('GET', event => {\r\n  // ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe argument to the handler callback is always called `event` (or `evt` or `e`), not `input`, and the 'event' terminology refers unambiguously to that argument, not to the `addEventListener` call or the handler or the invocation of the handler.\r\n\r\nThe same convention is used inside AWS Lambda:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexports.handler =  async function(event, context) {\r\n  return {...};\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo `RequestEvent` and `event` are the right names; I think the only question is whether to rename `LoadInput` to `LoadEvent` (I would say yes).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1129261738/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6631523527,"node_id":"RTE_lADOEiPr8c5J0Lc_zwAAAAGLRQTH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/6631523527","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-18T11:27:17Z","rename":{"from":"Kit
