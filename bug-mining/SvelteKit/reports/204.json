If the page is navigated to via a link, then the page itself will show a 500 error with the message `too many function arguments` but nothing will show in the server logs. If the page is hit directly, or refreshed after getting the 500 error the data will display, but javascript functionality is broken.\n\n### Reproduction\n\n[Reproduction Repo](https://github.com/jwsinner/sveltekit-error-repo) with a `data.json` file simulating the data causing the issue. Once the project is running, clicking the `Monitor` link in the header will navigate to the page causing the issue. Refreshing the page once the 500 error pops up should reproduce the displayed data but broken javascript issue.\n\n### Logs\n\n```shell\nBrowser console: `Uncaught SyntaxError: too many function arguments`\r\nNo server errors were logged.\n```\n\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.19042\r\n    CPU: (4) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3350P CPU @ 3.10GHz\r\n    Memory: 2.94 GB / 15.93 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.17.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    npm: 8.19.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 105.0.5195.102\r\n    Edge: Spartan (44.19041.1266.0), Chromium (104.0.1293.63)\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.19041.1202\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: next => 1.0.0-next.71\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: next => 1.0.0-next.463\r\n    svelte: ^3.46.0 => 3.49.0\r\n    vite: ^3.1.0-beta.1 => 3.1.0-beta.1\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nblocking an upgrade\n\n### Additional Information\n\nThis issue only popped up once the `props` got moved into `$page.data`. Prior to the update there was no issue because SvelteKit was just dumping the raw data onto the page without trying to manage it in a store.","closed_by":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
