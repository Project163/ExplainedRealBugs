was talking to @kevmodrome in the Swedish Svelte discord.

And the user isn't authenticated, I might want to throw a redirect to another route. Then it would be weird if we would run the beforeNavigate in the original route.\r\n\r\nHis argument for why it was working as intended was that I never navigate from the original route because the load threw and \"blocked\" the target route from rendering. And therefore I'm still on the original route when the redirect is ran. We try to navigate again (to the redirect destination)\r\n\r\nI understand his argument and why it happens now. But I don't know if it makes sense to run the beforeNavigate again.. Because the user/client has already said that it want to navigate away from the original route if that makes sense..\r\n</details>","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1310340836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Addeuz","id":12641358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjQxMzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12641358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Addeuz","html_url":"https://github.com/Addeuz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Addeuz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Addeuz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Addeuz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Addeuz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Addeuz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Addeuz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Addeuz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Addeuz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Addeuz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7784561679,"node_id":"MEE_lADOEiPr8c5WDE0qzwAAAAHP_vwP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7784561679","actor":{"login":"kevmodrome","id":534488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/534488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome","html_url":"https://github.com/kevmodrome","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-10T15:40:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7784561683,"node_id":"SE_lADOEiPr8c5WDE0qzwAAAAHP_vwT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7784561683","actor":{"login":"kevmodrome","id":534488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/534488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome","html_url":"https://github.com/kevmodrome","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevmodrome/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-10T15:40:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1310494237","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7584#issuecomment-1310494237","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7584","id":1310494237,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5OHI4d","user":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-10T15:48:49Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T15:48:49Z","body":"I

#7584\r\n\r\n### Please don't delete this checklist! Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [x] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7588/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7785907551,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5WDE0qzwAAAAHQE4Vf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7785907551","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-10T18:16:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7785907575,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5WDE0qzwAAAAHQE4V3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7785907575","actor":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8c480f6a9539dc4c1a95f1d396ad69fb504b54aa","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/8c480f6a9539dc4c1a95f1d396ad69fb504b54aa","created_at":"2022-11-10T18:16:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
