It works on v443, but stopped working on v444+\n\n### Reproduction\n\nhttps://github.com/CaptainCodeman/sveltekit-example/tree/ssr\r\n\r\nThe `invalidate()` call happens after client-side auth state changes and `/session` is called to set or clear server-side cookie. `LayoutData` should reflect the `user` from that cookie.\r\n\r\nNeeds firebase emulator running to execute locally. I can make a simpler cutdown repro if needed, was just working on this example which made me notice it:\r\n\r\nNo data reloads with v444:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/304910/187050362-e0a2204c-d334-43dd-8f83-f4e6f4286728.mov\r\n\r\nSame code with v443 showing layout data updates:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/304910/187050370-5d9d9692-2a9e-4e77-8089-4e9d33092d91.mov\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.5.1\r\n    CPU: (6) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8500B CPU @ 3.00GHz\r\n    Memory: 1.97 GB / 32.00 GB\r\n    Shell: 5.8.1 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    npm: 8.3.1 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Brave Browser: 102.1.39.111\r\n    Chrome: 104.0.5112.101\r\n    Chrome Canary: 107.0.5265.0\r\n    Firefox: 103.0.2\r\n    Safari: 15.6.1\r\n    Safari Technology Preview: 16.0\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: next => 1.0.0-next.87 \r\n    @sveltejs/kit: 1.0.0-next.444 => 1.0.0-next.444 \r\n    svelte: ^3.49.0 => 3.49.0 \r\n    vite: ^3.0.9 => 3.0.9\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nserious, but I can work around it\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6349/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6349/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
