But I believe that if I had the following:\r\n\r\n`src/routes/[...rest]/page1.svelte`\r\n\r\nThen the following routes would route to page1.svelte:\r\n\r\n`localhost:3000/a/b/c/page1.svelte`\r\n`localhost:3000/a/b/page1.svelte`\r\n\r\nWhich is correct. What I didn't realize is that `/page1.svelte` would also route to page1.svelte. Because with regular dynamic parameters you must have something there to be the parameter. For rest routes, the documents say:\r\n\r\n>src/routes/a/[...rest]/z.svelte will match /a/z as well as /a/b/z and /a/b/c/z and so on. Make sure you check that the value of the rest parameter is valid.\r\n\r\nAnd that does explain it correctly but it kind of flew over my head at /a/z match meant there was no ...rest parameter.\r\n\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nSpecify in the Rest Parameters description that it's different than regular dynamic routes in that it can have multiple dynamic parameters OR no parameters. Just clarify that there doesn't need to be a parameter.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nKeep it the way it is.\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4946/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
