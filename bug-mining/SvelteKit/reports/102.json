Currently, something like `(foo)/[...catchAll]` is prioritized above `bar` because it has more segments. `(foo)` segments shouldn't be counted when doing this sorting.\n\n### Reproduction\n\nnone, currently\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.10 Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa)\r\n    CPU: (8) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz\r\n    Memory: 10.36 GB / 12.32 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.0.17 - /bin/bash\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19\r\n    npm: 8.15.0\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nblocking an upgrade\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6235/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6235/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
