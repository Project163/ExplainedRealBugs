It can be used in a lot of different files files, except for the `hooks` file.\r\n\r\nIt is not that unlikely to have a logic inside the `handle` function that checks if the user is authorized and then redirect the user to the login page.\r\n\r\nIn order to do so someone can't throw a `redirect` as everything thrown inside `handle` will result in an 500 error. In order to redirect a proper `Response` object needs to be returned.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nif (!authorized) {\r\n\treturn new Response(null, { status: 302, headers: { Location: '/login' } })\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWriting it like this involves writing a bit of an overhead, but I would really love to use the `redirect` helper function like I do in all other code parts.\r\n\r\nI'm currently using a wrapper to handle this use case where `handleRequest` is the actual implementation of my `handle` functionality:\r\n```ts\r\nexport const handle: Handle = async (input) => handleRequest(input)\r\n\t.catch(error => {\r\n\t\t// can't use instanceof `Redirect` because class get's not exported\r\n\t\tif (error.status && error.location) {\r\n\t\t\treturn new Response(null, {\r\n\t\t\t\tstatus: error.status,\r\n\t\t\t\theaders: { location: error.location }\r\n\t\t\t})\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t// can't use instanceof `HttpError` because class get's not exported\r\n\t\tif (error.status && error.body) {\r\n\t\t\treturn new Response(JSON.stringify(error.body), { status: error.status })\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\treturn new Response(null, { status: 500 })\r\n\t})\r\n```\r\nHere I'm catching `Redirect`s and `HttpError`s and implementing and returning custom `Response`s. But this has a few weak points:\r\n - user code does not have access to `Redirect`, so I have to check it in another way\r\n - when SvelteKit changes the implementation of the `Redirect` class, my code will no longer work\r\n - possible inconsistencies with framework code (I did not take a look what exactly happens when SvelteKit handles `Redirect objects)\r\n - does not handle setting cookies (related to #7611)\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have an official solution to this problem.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\n`SvelteKit` should catch errors from the `handle` function and redirect the user if a `Redirect` class gets thrown.\r\n\r\nA similar thing could be done for the `HttpError` class thrown by the `error()` helper function. I guess that is related to this issue: https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/7272.\r\nAt least SvelteKit could set the correct status code when someone uses the `error` convenient function to throw inside `handle`.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nLeave it to users to\r\n1. discover that this functionality it is not supported\r\n2. figure out a way to make redirects happen\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7609/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
