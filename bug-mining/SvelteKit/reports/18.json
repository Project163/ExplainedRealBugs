The developer has to manually change the route to get to the desired location.\r\n\r\n### Describe the proposed solution\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if dev server redirected to base route by default.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives considered\r\n\r\nTo solve the issue I created a vite plugin - [vite-plugin-redirect](https://github.com/ebeloded/vite-plugin-redirect), which works like this:\r\n```js\r\nimport redirect from 'vite-plugin-redirect';\r\n\r\nconst base = '/admin';\r\n\r\n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */\r\nconst config = {\r\n  kit: {\r\n    paths: {\r\n      base\r\n    },\r\n    vite: {\r\n      plugins: [redirect({ '/': base })]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless there is a reason to not redirect to base, I think this functionality should be built-in.\r\n\r\n### Importance\r\n\r\nwould make my life easier\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/4418/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
