Describe the problem\n\nWe're deploying svelte kit under different subpaths of our domain (e.g. `our-domain.tld/app1/` `our-domain.tld/app2/` etc). It's a bit tedious to always have to remember to include the base when linking to a local app path:\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<script>\r\n  import { base } from \"$app/paths\";\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"{base}/local/application/path\">Link</a>\r\n```\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nIt would be very nice if `~` could be used as syntactic sugar for `{base}` in the `href` prop on links, and when using navigation functionality like the SvelteKit provided `goto` method etc:\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<a href=\"~/local/application/path\">Link</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne obvious problem with this is that using `~` in routes could cause problems when creating relative links.\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nOne alternative is to just create a custom link component:\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<script>\r\n  import { base } from \"$app/paths\";\r\n  \r\n  export let href;\r\n  // other props\r\n\r\n  function transformUrl(url) {\r\n    if (!url.startsWith(\"~\")) return url;\r\n    return base + url.slice(1);\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<a href={transformUrl(href)}>\r\n  <slot />\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage with this is that you have to handle how to style the anchor tags somehow. And also this doesn't cover things like `goto`. To fix this, you could just export the `transformUrl` function and use that directly. However, when you have to write `<a href={tranformUrl(\"~/my/link\")}>link</a>` you might be better off just sticking to `<a href=\"{base}/application/path\">link</a>`\r\n\r\nI started to look into if you could create a vite plugin for this, but it seems a bit complicated to cover all cases (like `goto` and links generated through functions etc).\r\n\r\nAs a side note, we already have `%sveltekit.assets%`, so adding `~` hopefully wouldn't add that much overhead.\n\n### Importance\n\nnice to have\n\n### Additional Information\n\nWould make it more aesthetically pleasing and ergonomic to create links, but using `{base}` works perfectly fine. I also understand that this might lead to undesirable breaking changes for people relying on `~` in their routes, hence might not be worth doing.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I feel it's worth sharing that having to add `{base}` to every URL in your app feels kind of awkward.

By default we _do_ want to support relative links when there's no base path, since it makes stuff more portable (see e.g. https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/595 for motivating use cases), but allowing `base: '/'` would be a sensible way to opt out of that.\r\n\r\nWe could in theory treat the existence of a `<base>` element (either in `src/app.html` or the rendered page content) as a signal to use absolute asset paths, but at SSR time it would have to be a naive `html.includes('<base')` check which could yield false positives, so specifying the option is preferable I think.

for looking into this!\r\n\r\nWell, on most cases with a present `<base>` the existing relative paths wouldn't work, so making asset paths absolute makes sense. But if you suspect you won't be able to avoid false positives, maybe just do `if (html.includes('<base')) console.log(\"Warning: you have <base> so you might want to opt for '/' in the base or asset base\")`?\r\n\r\nI suppose the best of both worlds would be to take the base `href` into account when creating the relative paths, but that's likely complicated with the current crawler.\r\n\r\nBtw it might be useful to expose the function that generates the relative paths. Things like `<base href=\"../../en/\">` would help with path prefixing but still allow putting the project in a directory.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1407225146/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tontonsb","id":16481303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDgxMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16481303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tontonsb","html_url":"https://github.com/tontonsb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tontonsb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tontonsb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tontonsb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tontonsb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tontonsb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tontonsb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tontonsb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tontonsb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tontonsb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/comments/1407229076","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/8559#issuecomment-1407229076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8559","id":1407229076,"node_id":"IC_kwDOEiPr8c5T4JyU","user":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-28T00:51:51Z","updated_at":"2023-01-28T00:51:51Z","body":"A

[this](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/issues/5#issuecomment-712725420) here:\r\n\r\n>One blocking issue I've run into with the current Sapper is that I can't rewrite urls from various sites that we want to host a \"whitelabel\" version of our app on, because the basepath has to be set in stone at build time:\r\n>\r\n> https://example.com/some-path/ <-- does not work\r\n> https://subdomain.example.com/ <-- works fine\r\n> \r\n> rather than host a different app for people who want to mount it under a subpath, ideally basepath could be a runtime concern. However I don't know if this is feasible, but it's worth considering.\r\n\r\n> Cool. For me it is to support ipfs website both when served through an ENS domain or through a gateway with ipfs/ base path for example, both url point to the same exact content : \r\n> https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeieeuq3av6jdys2q2zwhfv5hutcqejczr46wzjikd5vulfaxfi72r4/\r\n> https://jolly-roger.eth.link/\r\n> for the hash version, I have to compute at runtime the basepath since it is not possible to know the hash of an ipfs website at build time\r\n>\r\n> https://ptb.discord.com/channels/457912077277855764/750388563354583071/771786495152357386\r\n\r\n`paths.base` is baked into the app at build time.
