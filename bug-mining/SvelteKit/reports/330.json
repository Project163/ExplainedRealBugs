The problem is that users sometimes use trailing slash in URLs. In this case, the loaded page looks like it has no css loaded, but with the correct content. I would expect a redirect to the URL without a trailing slash. \r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior in this case?\r\n\r\nhttps://sveltekit-trailing-slash.vercel.app/test\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-01-27 182023](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1249779/215152544-19faedac-aa39-4c8d-b642-5e42cf2138ef.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://sveltekit-trailing-slash.vercel.app/test/\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-01-27 182012](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1249779/215152539-4ea1be39-5f5d-4e7a-8aec-073e57073e27.png)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\nDemo: https://sveltekit-trailing-slash.vercel.app/\r\n\r\nRepository: https://github.com/yellowby/sveltekit-trailing-slash\n\n### Logs\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Info\n\n```Shell\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Windows 10 10.0.22621\r\n    CPU: (16) x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz\r\n    Memory: 38.98 GB / 63.93 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 18.13.0 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.EXE\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.19 - C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Yarn\\bin\\yarn.CMD\r\n    npm: 8.19.3 - C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\npm.CMD\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Edge: Spartan (44.22621.1105.0), Chromium (109.0.1518.69)\r\n    Internet Explorer: 11.0.22621.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-auto: ^1.0.2 => 1.0.2\r\n    @sveltejs/adapter-node: ^1.1.4 => 1.1.4\r\n    @sveltejs/kit: ^1.0.0 => 1.3.1\r\n    svelte: ^3.54.0 => 3.55.1\r\n    vite: ^4.0.0 => 4.0.4\n```\n\n\n### Severity\n\nannoyance\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/8755/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
