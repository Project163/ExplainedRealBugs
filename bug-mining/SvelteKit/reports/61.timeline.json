seeing similar problems, but it is even worse. I have a statically generated site and the HTML has the links right (no trailing slash), but on click, something adds the slash before navigating.  This happens for external links, but also to internal links to static assets like PDFs. So `<a href=\"/pdfs/xyz.pdf\">Download PDF</a>` is generated correctly, but if someone clicks it, they get a 404.  The `rel=\"external\"` trick doesn't make sense for the static asset use case. Finding and modifying all of the links to add extra attributes isn't ideal, so I'm hoping someone picks this up.
