Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following:\r\n- [x] It's really useful if your PR references an issue where it is discussed ahead of time. In many cases, features are absent for a reason. For large changes, please create an RFC: https://github.com/sveltejs/rfcs\r\n- [x] This message body should clearly illustrate what problems it solves.\r\n- [ ] Ideally, include a test that fails without this PR but passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] Run the tests with `pnpm test` and lint the project with `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check`\r\n\r\n### Changesets\r\n- [x] If your PR makes a change that should be noted in one or more packages' changelogs, generate a changeset by running `pnpm changeset` and following the prompts. All changesets should be `patch` until SvelteKit 1.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/6518/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7311128411,"node_id":"CE_lADOEiPr8c5Q5UeMzwAAAAGzxvdb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7311128411","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-02T07:55:45Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7311128714,"node_id":"REFE_lADOEiPr8c5Q5UeMzwAAAAGzxviK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/events/7311128714","actor":{"login":"dummdidumm","id":5968653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njg2NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5968653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm","html_url":"https://github.com/dummdidumm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dummdidumm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d9a8f4b1ec937741a35e6b4396e9866a513516ea","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/commits/d9a8f4b1ec937741a35e6b4396e9866a513516ea","created_at":"2022-09-02T07:55:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"saibotsivad","id":91254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad","html_url":"https://github.com/saibotsivad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-07T18:04:41Z","updated_at":"2022-10-07T18:04:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/sites/issues/383","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/sites","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/sites/issues/383/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/sites/issues/383/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/sites/issues/383/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sveltejs/sites/issues/383","id":1401507436,"node_id":"I_kwDOE-96585TiU5s","number":383,"title":"Footer
