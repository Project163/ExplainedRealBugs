On a number of occasions I've found myself doing things like `if (routeId)` and getting caught out because it can sometimes be the empty string.\r\n\r\nSince we expose `routeId` via `event`, app developers will inevitably run into the same issue.\n\n### Describe the proposed solution\n\nIt would be safer, and arguably more intuitive, if route IDs were always prefixed with `/`. \n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nThe problem of course is that this would be a breaking change, and we can't detect people doing `routeId === 'foo'`. For the people currently using `routeId` this would be annoying.\r\n\r\nThe question is whether causing breaking change for that population is more costly than reaching 1.0 with a known design flaw.\n\n### Importance\n\nwould make my life easier\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Rich-Harris","id":1162160,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjIxNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1162160?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris","html_url":"https://github.com/Rich-Harris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rich-Harris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7332/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sveltejs/kit/issues/7332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
