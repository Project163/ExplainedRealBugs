It doesn't seem like there's an especially great way to make that happen automatically.\n\nManually, you can create an implementation and then do:\n\n``` java\nURL url = new URL(null, path.toUri().toString(), new JimfsURLStreamHandler());\n```\n\nIt's also possible to use `URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory(URLStreamHandlerFactory)` to statically set a factory to use for getting `URLStreamHandler`s for custom protocols. Setting that would allow `uri.toURL()` to work, but it doesn't seem like a good idea for Jimfs to set the `URLStreamHandlerFactory` automatically because it would conflict with anything else that may also try to set the factory (that method can only be called once).\n\nThe final piece of complexity is just how the `URLStreamHandler` should behave. If you just want reading files by `URL` to work, it should be enough to create a `URLConnection` that only overrides `getInputStream()`.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/comments/56426552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cgdecker","id":101568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker","html_url":"https://github.com/cgdecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":168651632,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2ODY1MTYzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/events/168651632","actor":{"login":"cgdecker","id":101568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker","html_url":"https://github.com/cgdecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-09-22T19:31:28Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/comments/69604435","html_url":"https://github.com/google/jimfs/issues/13#issuecomment-69604435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/13","id":69604435,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjA0NDM1","user":{"login":"seanrohead","id":9420643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MjA2NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9420643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanrohead","html_url":"https://github.com/seanrohead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanrohead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanrohead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanrohead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanrohead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanrohead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanrohead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanrohead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanrohead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanrohead/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-12T17:03:48Z","updated_at":"2015-01-12T17:06:52Z","body":"You don't need to change the default stream handler factory for this to work.

\r\n\r\nwe ran into some issues in our unit tests, where EMF is trying to write to some URL in the jimfs filesystem.\r\n\r\nThe stack is the following:\r\n```java\r\nPathURLConnection.getOutputStream() line: 130  =>  \"protocol doesn't support output\"\r\nURIHandlerImpl.createOutputStream(URI, Map<?,?>) line: 154   \r\nExtensibleURIConverterImpl.createOutputStream(URI, Map<?,?>) line: 349   \r\nPlatformResourceURIHandlerImpl.createOutputStream(URI, Map<?,?>) line: 498   \r\nExtensibleURIConverterImpl.createOutputStream(URI, Map<?,?>) line: 349   \r\nModelResourceImpl(ResourceImpl).save(Map<?,?>) line: 1041\r\n```\r\nTo make EMF aware of jimfs, we register the top-level URI of a jimfs path into the ecore 'platform resource map' (essentially a map from Eclipse IProject -> URI) in the test setup:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nEcorePlugin.getPlatformResourceMap().put(\"VdkWithVHub\", URI.createURI(top.toUri().toString()));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be good, if the [PathURLConnection](https://github.com/google/jimfs/blob/master/jimfs/src/main/java/com/google/common/jimfs/PathURLConnection.java) could also implement the write protocol.\r\n\r\nA trivial implementation fixed the issue for us: [pull request](https://github.com/google/jimfs/pull/160)\r\n\r\nWe would kindly ask to review the change and make suggestions if you see any violations of the protocol.\r\n\r\nalso see: #13 [Obtaining a URL from a jimfs path](https://github.com/google/jimfs/issues/13)\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJanik\r\n
