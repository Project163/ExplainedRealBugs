If a thread is interrupted when or \"while\" calling these methods, then the method must throw a `ClosedByInterruptException` and the channel must be closed:\n- `FileChannel.position(long)`\n- `FileChannel.position()`\n- `FileChannel.size()`\n- `FileChannel.force(boolean)`\n\nThere might be other methods that deviate besides these, but these are the ones that my tests caught. Correct interrupt behaviour is important to me, because my code needs to correctly cope with stray interrupts, which I obviously have to test for.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cgdecker","id":101568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker","html_url":"https://github.com/cgdecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
