If no byte is available because the stream is at end of file, the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into b. \n\nSo if len is 0, 0 should be returned no matter what.\n\n`JimfsInputStream` does not behave that way. As can be seen here: https://github.com/google/jimfs/blob/0c8b10edbe28805a2b1813c3f882939a8d41af74/jimfs/src/main/java/com/google/common/jimfs/JimfsInputStream.java#L87-L91\n\nIf `finished` is satisfied it will always return -1 even if it should return 0.\n\n---\n\nI ran into this while migrating an existing application to use Jimfs in tests. \nRegular `FileInpuStream`s backed by the default file system behave as documented.","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
