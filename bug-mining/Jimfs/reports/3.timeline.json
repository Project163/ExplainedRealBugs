Here was my reasoning for not implementing `InterruptibleChannel`'s interrupt behavior for these methods:\n- Blocking on the lock that guards the channel's position (to meet the requirement that no more than one method that uses the channel's position can run concurrently) does not have the interrupt behavior specified by `InterruptibleChannel`. That interrupt behavior only applies to the I/O operations themselves. This is consistent with how the default `FileChannelImpl` does it.\n- If the \"I/O\" part of the method (the part guarded by the position lock) is doing negligible work (i.e. not blocking on the file's I/O lock), there's no need to try to implement interrupt behavior there given that the method will return almost immediately and it should be harmless if an interrupt that happened to occur just before the method returned is treated the same as one that occurred just after the method returned.\n\nI suppose, though, that if the thread was interrupted while blocking on the `synchronized (this)` that guards the position, it might be preferable to have the interrupt behavior occur immediately after that blocking ends.\n\nFor `force(boolean)` at least, though, I'm not sure there's anything to change: it does literally nothing but check that the channel is open and then return. It doesn't block on anything.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/comments/92993788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cgdecker","id":101568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker","html_url":"https://github.com/cgdecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/comments/93015485","html_url":"https://github.com/google/jimfs/issues/21#issuecomment-93015485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/21","id":93015485,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkzMDE1NDg1","user":{"login":"chrisvest","id":7993,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisvest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisvest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-14T18:44:54Z","updated_at":"2015-04-14T18:44:54Z","body":"This makes sense if you're building a FileSystem for real use.
