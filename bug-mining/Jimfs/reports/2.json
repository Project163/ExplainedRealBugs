framework I'm testing internally needs to obtain an URL from a passed in path. For testing, I'd like to use jimfs, but obtaining a URL from a jimfs path seems not to be possible. Calling `path.toUri().toURL()` throws a MalformedURLException with message: `java.net.MalformedURLException: unknown protocol: jimfs`. Is this something fixable or something to live with? Here is a simpe test case to reproduce:\n\n``` java\nimport java.net.MalformedURLException;\nimport java.net.URI;\nimport java.nio.file.FileSystem;\nimport java.nio.file.Path;\n\nimport org.junit.Test;\n\nimport com.google.common.jimfs.Configuration;\nimport com.google.common.jimfs.Jimfs;\n\npublic class JimFSTest {\n\n    @Test\n    public void testGetURL() throws MalformedURLException {\n        final FileSystem fs = Jimfs.newFileSystem(Configuration.unix());\n        final Path path = fs.getPath(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n        final URI uri = path.toUri();\n        uri.toURL();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nEdit: I just found out that one can implement a `URLStreamHandlerFactory` to accomplish this. You might consider to ship a suitable implementation for jimfs.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cgdecker","id":101568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker","html_url":"https://github.com/cgdecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
