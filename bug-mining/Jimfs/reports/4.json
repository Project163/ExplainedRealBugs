the following code:\r\n\r\n\ttry (FileSystem jimFs = Jimfs.newFileSystem(Configuration.unix())) {\r\n\t\tfinal Path workDir = jimFs.getPath(\"\");\r\n\t\tFiles.createFile(workDir.resolve(\"file1.txt\"));\r\n\t\tfinal Path entry = Files.list(workDir).collect(MoreCollectors.onlyElement());\r\n\t\tLOGGER.info(\"Entry: {}, abs: {}, exists: {}, exists as abs: {}.\", entry, entry.toAbsolutePath(), Files.exists(entry), Files.exists(entry.toAbsolutePath()));\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nIt prints: `Entry: /file1.txt, abs: /work/file1.txt, exists: false, exists as abs: true.`\r\n\r\nI think that the entry name `/file1.txt` is incorrect. This seems to designate an absolute path, whereas a relative path is expected here (relative to the work dir). A bigger problem (maybe caused by the previous one) is that `Files.exists` reports this entry to not exist. Whereas the same entry is reported to exist when using its absolute form. Whether a file exists should not depend on the form of its path, and this entry does exist, in any case.","closed_by":{"login":"cpovirk","id":1703908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk","html_url":"https://github.com/cpovirk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
