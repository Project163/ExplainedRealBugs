Handling closing a FileSystem better is something I've been meaning to do but haven't gotten around to yet, partly because there's generally not a lot of harm if the file system still works after it's closed. I suspect that behavior is mostly specified with file systems like ZipFileSystem (which must close its open file when it's closed) in mind. That said, I do want to follow the spec as closely as possible.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/comments/37455145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cgdecker","id":101568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker","html_url":"https://github.com/cgdecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":101688351,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEwMTY4ODM1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/events/101688351","actor":{"login":"cgdecker","id":101568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker","html_url":"https://github.com/cgdecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-03-13T15:04:56Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":121669665,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDEyMTY2OTY2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/events/121669665","actor":{"login":"cgdecker","id":101568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker","html_url":"https://github.com/cgdecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-05-15T21:33:38Z","milestone":{"title":"1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":122070906,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEyMjA3MDkwNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/issues/events/122070906","actor":{"login":"cgdecker","id":101568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTU2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker","html_url":"https://github.com/cgdecker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cgdecker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"842e5adef329557ff4310a2bbaa3302967ace69d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/jimfs/commits/842e5adef329557ff4310a2bbaa3302967ace69d","created_at":"2014-05-16T21:2
