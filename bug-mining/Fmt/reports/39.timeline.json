Changing them to indexed would not practical, nor very nice to the user of such API. The named argument is used to log \"strerror\", similarly as was common with printf, i.e. original `%m` is replaced by fmt `{m}`. This is achieved by adding a named argument `\"m\"_a` as the last argument after what user provides in a log function. I also have a similar implementation [in open-source here](https://github.com/rbrich/xcikit/blob/eaab9305ef61d23d88bdb43a6292c964df6ad3ff/src/xci/core/log.h#L65).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if such a logging function could have the format checked in compile-time, but I understand that the named argument support is still somewhat experimental.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/comments/1253663042/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rbrich","id":6216152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMTYxNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6216152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbrich","html_url":"https://github.com/rbrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rbrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7500767376,"node_id":"LE_lADOAGurSs5SEx7KzwAAAAG_FKCQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/events/7500767376","actor":{"login":"vitaut","id":576385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjM4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/576385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut","html_url":"https://github.com/vitaut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-01T17:16:25Z","label":{"name":"help

#3105\r\n\r\nLooks like this is enough to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nI compared the runtime checking with compile-time checking and adjusted the compile-time version to mirror the runtime one.\r\n\r\nThe runtime check is this (second function for named args):\r\n```\r\n    FMT_CONSTEXPR auto on_arg_id(int id) -> int {\r\n      return parse_context.check_arg_id(id), id;\r\n    }\r\n    FMT_CONSTEXPR auto on_arg_id(basic_string_view<Char> id) -> int {\r\n      int arg_id = context.arg_id(id);\r\n      if (arg_id < 0) on_error(\"argument not found\");\r\n      return arg_id;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIt returns the arg index directly without running it through the `check_arg_id`, unlike the indexed arg check.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease read the contribution guidelines before submitting a pull
