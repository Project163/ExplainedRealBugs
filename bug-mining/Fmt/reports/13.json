I'm having an issue where I only want part of a string to be colored, so I'd like to wrap it in `fmt::format` and pass the colored result to a `fmt::print`, but currently that is not possible. I thought about changing it myself but it required more changes than expected and I don't fully know how the code works.\r\n\r\nGreat library, by the way!","closed_by":{"login":"vitaut","id":576385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjM4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/576385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut","html_url":"https://github.com/vitaut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/993/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
