See: https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/libc/manual/html_node/Control-Functions.html\r\n\r\nCommit ef54f9aa3858d7d10591719615bce337fbe49c40 changed the implementation of `fmt::isnan` from:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\ntemplate <typename T> constexpr bool isnan(T value) {\r\n  return value != value;  // std::isnan doesn't support __float128.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\ntemplate <typename T> constexpr bool isnan(T value) {\r\n  return !(value >= value);  // std::isnan doesn't support __float128.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe commit description says that this was done to suppress `-Wfloat-equal` warnings. The problem is that these two implementations are subtly different: while they both return the same value, the newer implementation also sets a floating-point exception flag. The reason is that while for IEEE-754 floating-point numbers the operation `NaN != NaN` is well defined and will always return true, `NaN >= NaN` is technically an invalid operation, hence why the exception flag is set (at least this is my non-expert understanding).\r\n\r\nThis has been causing headaches for a project I'm working on because I wanted to trace where floating-point exceptions were emanating from in my program (using the [GNU-specific `feenableexcept` function](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/libc/manual/html_node/Control-Functions.html)), but `fmt::isnan` will raise a spurious exception every time a NaN is passed in. Changing the code to use `value != value` instead fixes things.\r\n\r\nI guess there are different ways to fix this, but maybe you could just return to using `value != value` and find another way to suppress the warning (e.g. with a comment or a compiler argument)?","closed_by":{"login":"vitaut","id":576385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjM4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/576385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut","html_url":"https://github.com/vitaut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3948/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
