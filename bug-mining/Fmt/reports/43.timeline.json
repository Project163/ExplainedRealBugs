by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>-   Added support for the `%j` specifier (the number of days) for `std::chrono::duration` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3643, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3732). Thanks @intelfx.\r\n\r\n-   Added support for the chrono suffix for days and changed the suffix for minutes from \"m\" to the correct \"min\" (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3662, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3664). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/9KhMnq9ba)):\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n      fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", std::chrono::days(42)); // prints \"42d\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Thanks @Richardk2n.\r\n\r\n-   Fixed an overflow in `std::chrono::time_point` formatting with large dates (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3725, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3727). Thanks @cschreib.\r\n\r\n-   Added a formatter for `std::source_location` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3730). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/YajfKjhhr)):\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    #include <source_location>\r\n    #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n      fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", std::source_location::current());\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    prints\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    /app/example.cpp:5:51: int main()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Thanks @felix642.\r\n\r\n-   Added a formatter for `std::bitset` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3660). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/bdEaGeYxe)):\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    #include <bitset>\r\n    #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n      fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", std::bitset<6>(42)); // prints \"101010\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Thanks @muggenhor.\r\n\r\n-   Added an experimental `nested_formatter` that provides an easy way of applying a formatter to one or more subobjects while automatically handling width, fill and alignment. For example:\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    #include <fmt/format.h>\r\n\r\n    struct point {\r\n      double x, y;\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    template <>\r\n    struct fmt::formatter<point> : nested_formatter<double> {\r\n      auto format(point p, format_context& ctx) const {\r\n        return write_padded(ctx, [=](auto out) {\r\n          return format_to(out, \"({}, {})\", nested(p.x), nested(p.y));\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n      fmt::print(\"[{:>20.2f}]\", point{1, 2});\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    prints\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [          (1.00, 2.00)]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n-   Added the generic representation (`g`) to `std::filesystem::path` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3715, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3729). For example:\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    #include <filesystem>\r\n    #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n      fmt::print(\"{:g}\\n\", std::filesystem::path(\"C:\\\\foo\"));\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    prints `\"C:/foo\"` on Windows.\r\n\r\n    Thanks @js324.\r\n\r\n-   Made `format_as` work with references (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3739). Thanks @tchaikov.\r\n\r\n-   Fixed formatting of invalid UTF-8 with precision (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3284).\r\n\r\n-   Fixed an inconsistency between `fmt::to_string` and `fmt::format` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3684).\r\n\r\n-   Disallowed unsafe uses of `fmt::styled` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3625):\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    auto s = fmt::styled(std::string(\"dangle\"), fmt::emphasis::bold);\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", s); // compile error\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Pass `fmt::styled(...)` as a parameter instead.\r\n\r\n-   Added a null check when formatting a C string with the `s` specifier (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3706).\r\n\r\n-   Disallowed the `c` specifier for `bool` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3726, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3734). Thanks @js324.\r\n\r\n-   Made the default formatting unlocalized in `fmt::ostream_formatter` for consistency with the rest of the library (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3460).\r\n\r\n-   Fixed localized formatting in bases other than decimal (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3693, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3750). Thanks @js324.\r\n\r\n-   Fixed a performance regression in experimental `fmt::ostream::print` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3674).\r\n\r\n-   Added synchronization with the underlying output stream when writing to the Windows console (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3668, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3688, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3689). Thanks @Roman-Koshelev and @dimztimz.\r\n\r\n-   Changed to only export `format_error` when {fmt} is built as a shared library (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3626, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3627). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n-   Made `fmt::streamed` `constexpr`. (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3650). Thanks @muggenhor.\r\n\r\n-   Enabled `consteval` on older versions of MSVC (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3757). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n-   Added an option to build without `wchar_t` support on Windows (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3631, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3636). Thanks @glebm.\r\n\r\n-   Improved build and CI configuration (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3679, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3701, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3702, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3749). Thanks @jcar87, @pklima and @tchaikov.\r\n\r\n-   Fixed various warnings, compilation and test issues (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3607, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3610, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3624, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3630, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3634, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3638, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3645, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3646, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3647, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3652, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3654, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3663, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3670, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3680, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3694, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3695, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3699, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3705, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3710, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3712, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3713, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3714, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3716, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3723, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3738, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3740, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3741, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3743, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3745, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3747, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3748, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3751, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3754, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3755, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3760, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3762, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3763, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3764, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3774, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3779).
