I love using your library. \r\n\r\nI saw [this](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/985) issue but it was closed. Here is my usecase of time_point:\r\n```\r\nclass record {\r\nstd::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock> last_modified, ...;\r\nvoid init() {\r\n    last_modified = std::chrono::system_clock::now();\r\n}\r\nvoid expired() {\r\n    return ((std::chrono::system_clock::now() - last_modified) >  std::chrono::hours(8));\r\n}\r\n// Bunch of other operations that add/subtract duration to another time_point member.\r\n};\r\n```\r\nI want to implement a `print()` that displays the time_point members. Here is what I do now:\r\n```\r\nvoid print() {\r\n    const auto time_c = std::chrono::system_clock::to_time_t(last_modified);\r\n    std::cout << std::ctime(&time_c);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI would like to use `fmt::print(\"{}\", last_modified)` and be done with it. Could you please consider my request?
