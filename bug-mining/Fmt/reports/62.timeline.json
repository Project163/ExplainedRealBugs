reason\r\n* To check (when the whole project actually builds)\r\n  * If it works fine and runtime performance is equivalent\r\n  * Impact on building non-module files; hopefully they'll build faster.\r\n  * How it affects compilation pre-checks, in terms of what's checked before rebuilding (impact of CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES)\r\n* Currently out of scope: `import std;`\r\n\r\n### Documentation entry for user-facing changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Documentation is written (mandatory for new features)\r\n\r\n<!---\r\nDirectly edit documentation source files in the \"docs\" folder with the

information should be added (but add more as needed).\r\n- Motivation: Why is this function, table engine, etc. useful to ClickHouse users?\r\n\r\n- Parameters: If the feature being added takes
