has thrown me for a huge loop. I have an issue related to caching of alias template specializations. After a lot of hunting, I determined it's caused by this trailing return type during class template instantiation: https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/9d5b9defde1334726d35c0d21b6225511ed3976e/include/fmt/core.h#L1360-L1361\r\n\r\nThe return type is calling `this->map(\"\")`, but _this_ (`arg_mapper`) is still an incomplete type - I've only instantiated the functions above the `map` at line 1360 at this point.\r\n\r\nWhen overload resolution considers the constructor at line 1345, the `std::is_constructible<>` constraint on 1342 ends up (many levels of indirection down) attempting to construct an instance of `arg_mapper` in an unevaluated context. However, this attempt fails, because no default ctor is declared because I haven't finished injecting all the member functions, and therefore no implicit declaration of the default ctor.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this lack of ctor causes an alias template to fail substitution, and I've noted that failure in my alias template cache. After the `arg_mapper` class is complete, there's another `is_formattable` evaluation on the same arguments. This time it should succeed, but I've already cached it is a SFINAE failure, so am returning that, which causes the range test to fail.\r\n\r\n/usr/include/c++/10/type_traits:906:5 - is_constructible\r\n/usr/include/c++/10/type_traits:900:5 - __is_constructible_impl\r\nHere the __is_constructible compiler builtin is invoked with `T = formatter<char[1], char, void>`\r\n\r\nThe partial specializations of `formatter` are examined, since one must be selected in order to consider construction. The ranges partial makes things go haywire:\r\nhttps://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/9d5b9defde1334726d35c0d21b6225511ed3976e/include/fmt/ranges.h#L581\r\n\r\nThis guy is in the list of constraints:\r\n```cpp\r\nis_formattable<detail::value_type<T>, Char>::value\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat alias template is defined like so:\r\nhttps://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/9d5b9defde1334726d35c0d21b6225511ed3976e/include/fmt/core.h#L1776-L1781\r\n\r\nThe compiler attempts to construct `arg_mapper` in this unevaluated context:\r\n```cpp\r\ndetail::arg_mapper<buffer_context<Char>>()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `arg_mapper` is still incomplete, because we're still trying to evaluate the trailing-return-type for the `map` functions. Therefore, the implicit default ctor hasn't yet been declared. `__is_constructible` returns false, since there is no yet-declared ctor, and the alias template specialization `is_formattable` gets its SFINAE failure written to the alias template cache.\r\n\r\nThis substitution failure doesn't effect `arg_mapper`'s definition at all. All it did was knock this ranges `formatter` partial out of the candidate set, but that wasn't going to be the partial chosen, since there are character formatters that are chosen.\r\nhttps://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/9d5b9defde1334726d35c0d21b6225511ed3976e/include/fmt/ranges.h#L581\r\n\r\nThe problem is that later on we really do need this partial template definition of `formatter`:\r\nhttps://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/9d5b9defde1334726d35c0d21b6225511ed3976e/test/enforce-checks-test.cc#L55\r\n\r\nThe `vector` formatter is supposed to match it. But we've already attempted evaluated `is_formattable` on those same arguments, and it failed, so we just use that cached value, and this time the program is ill-formed, since there is no partial candidate.\r\n\r\nYou have a note about an MSVC workaround at this place:\r\nhttps://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/9d5b9defde1334726d35c0d21b6225511ed3976e/include/fmt/ranges.h#L585\r\n\r\nWas there a discussion about this? I don't know if this is a compiler bug or a library bug. Should two specializations of the same alias template with the same arguments be considered equivalent?\r\n\r\nEither way, I think it's very dangerous to be writing `this->map(\"\")` in your trailing-return-type, since the `arg_mapper` class is incomplete, you're not getting an accurate picture of the class.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I've never experienced a break like this with Hana, Boost.PFR, mdspan or the other really advanced template libraries. I think it's cursed code.\r\n\r\nIf we removed the trailing-return-type from those `map` overloads and rely on return type deduction, everything works:\r\n```cpp\r\n  FMT_CONSTEXPR FMT_INLINE auto map(const signed char* val) {\r\n    return map(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(val));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince it's in the body of the function, it's not instantiated until after the `arg_mapper` specialization is made complete, so the `arg_mapper` implicit ctor is defined.\r\n\r\n;tldr:\r\nCan we not do `decltype(this->map(\"\"))` in the return type and instead just name the type?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2635/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":5},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/2635/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
