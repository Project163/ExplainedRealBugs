described in #3948, the current internal implementation of `isnan` triggers a floating-point exception as a side effect, unlike `std::isnan`. This can cause issues for users attempting to find other causes of FP exceptions in their code.\r\n\r\nFix by changing `isnan` to use `value != value` as a test, which does not have side effects.\r\n\r\nI also added a test to confirm that FP exceptions are not raised (as suggested by @vitaut). I've confirmed that it fails with the current implementation and passes with this one.\r\n\r\nFixes

by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>- Added `fmt/base.h` which provides a subset of the API with minimal include dependencies and enough functionality to replace all uses of the `printf` family of functions. This brings the compile time of code using {fmt} much closer to the equivalent `printf` code as shown on the following benchmark that compiles 100 source files:\r\n\r\n  | Method       | Compile Time (s) |\r\n  |--------------|------------------|\r\n  | printf       | 1.6              |\r\n  | IOStreams    | 25.9             |\r\n  | fmt 10.x     | 19.0             |\r\n  | fmt 11.0     | 4.8              |\r\n  | tinyformat   | 29.1             |\r\n  | Boost Format | 55.0             |\r\n\r\n  This gives almost 4x improvement in build speed compared to version 10. Note that the benchmark is purely formatting code and includes. In real projects the difference from `printf` will be smaller partly because common standard headers will be included in almost any translation unit (TU) anyway. In particular, in every case except `printf` above ~1s is spent in total on including `<type_traits>` in all TUs.\r\n\r\n- Optimized includes in other headers such as `fmt/format.h` which is now roughly equivalent to the old `fmt/core.h` in terms of build speed.\r\n\r\n- Migrated the documentation at https://fmt.dev/ from Sphinx to MkDocs.\r\n\r\n- Improved C++20 module support (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3990, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3991, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3993, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3994, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3997, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3998, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4004, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4005, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4006, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4013, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4027, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4029). In particular, native CMake support for modules is now used if available. Thanks @yujincheng08 and @matt77hias.\r\n\r\n- Added an option to replace standard includes with `import std` enabled via the `FMT_IMPORT_STD` macro (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3921, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3928). Thanks @matt77hias.\r\n\r\n- Exported `fmt::range_format`, `fmt::range_format_kind` and `fmt::compiled_string` from the `fmt` module (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3970, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3999). Thanks @matt77hias and @yujincheng08.\r\n\r\n- Improved integration with stdio in `fmt::print`, enabling direct writes into a C stream buffer in common cases. This may give significant performance improvements ranging from tens of percent to [2x]( https://stackoverflow.com/a/78457454/471164) and eliminates dynamic memory allocations on the buffer level. It is currently enabled for built-in and string types with wider availability coming up in future releases.\r\n\r\n  For example, it gives ~24% improvement on a [simple benchmark]( https://isocpp.org/files/papers/P3107R5.html#perf) compiled with Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.1.0.2.5) and run on macOS 14.2.1:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Benchmark             Time             CPU   Iterations\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------\r\n  printf             81.8 ns         81.5 ns      8496899\r\n  fmt::print (10.x)  63.8 ns         61.9 ns     11524151\r\n  fmt::print (11.0)  51.3 ns         51.0 ns     13846580\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Improved safety of `fmt::format_to` when writing to an array (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3805). For example ([godbolt](https://www.godbolt.org/z/cYrn8dWY8)):\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n  auto volkswagen = char[4];\r\n  auto result = fmt::format_to(volkswagen, \"elephant\");\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  no longer results in a buffer overflow. Instead the output will be truncated and you can get the end iterator and whether truncation occurred from the `result` object. Thanks @ThePhD.\r\n\r\n- Enabled Unicode support by default in MSVC, bringing it on par with other compilers and making it unnecessary for users to enable it explicitly. Most of {fmt} is encoding-agnostic but this prevents mojibake in places where encoding matters such as path formatting and terminal output. You can control the Unicode support via the CMake `FMT_UNICODE` option. Note that some {fmt} packages such as the one in vcpkg have already been compiled with Unicode enabled.\r\n\r\n- Added a formatter for `std::expected` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3834). Thanks @dominicpoeschko.\r\n\r\n- Added a formatter for `std::complex` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1467, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3886, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3892, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3900). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n- Added a formatter for `std::type_info` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3978). Thanks @matt77hias.\r\n\r\n- Specialized `formatter` for `std::basic_string` types with custom traits and allocators (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3938, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3943). Thanks @dieram3.\r\n\r\n- Added formatters for `std::chrono::day`, `std::chrono::month`, `std::chrono::year` and `std::chrono::year_month_day` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3758, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3772, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3906, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3913). For example:\r\n\r\n  ```c++\r\n  #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n  #include <fmt/color.h>\r\n\r\n  int main() {\r\n    fmt::print(fg(fmt::color::green), \"{}\\n\", std::chrono::day(7));\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  prints a green day:\r\n\r\n  <img width=\"306\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/assets/576385/6e395f8b-451a-4cf7-bccc-ee92ca0dec65\">\r\n\r\n  Thanks @zivshek.\r\n\r\n- Fixed handling of precision in `%S` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3794, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3814). Thanks @js324.\r\n\r\n- Added support for the `-` specifier (glibc `strftime` extension) to day of the month (`%d`) and week of the year (`%W`, `%U`, `%V`) specifiers (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3976). Thanks @ZaheenJ.\r\n\r\n- Fixed the scope of the `-` extension in chrono formatting so that it doesn't apply to subsequent specifiers (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3811, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3812). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n- Improved handling of `time_point::min()` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3282).\r\n\r\n- Added support for character range formatting (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3857, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3863). Thanks @js324.\r\n\r\n- Added `string` and `debug_string` range formatters (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3973, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4024). Thanks @matt77hias.\r\n\r\n- Enabled ADL for `begin` and `end` in `fmt::join` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3813, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3824). Thanks @bbolli.\r\n\r\n- Made contiguous iterator optimizations apply to `std::basic_string` iterators (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3798). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n- Added support for ranges with mutable `begin` and `end` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3752, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3800, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3955). Thanks @tcbrindle and @Arghnews.\r\n\r\n- Added support for move-only iterators to `fmt::join` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3802, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3946). Thanks @Arghnews.\r\n\r\n- Moved range and iterator overloads of `fmt::join` to `fmt/ranges.h`, next to other overloads.\r\n\r\n- Fixed handling of types with `begin` returning `void` such as Eigen matrices (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3839, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3964). Thanks @Arghnews.\r\n\r\n- Added an `fmt::formattable` concept (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3974). Thanks @matt77hias.\r\n\r\n- Added support for `__float128` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3494).\r\n\r\n- Fixed rounding issues when formatting `long double` with fixed precision (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3539).\r\n\r\n- Made `fmt::isnan` not trigger floating-point exception for NaN values (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3948, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3951). Thanks @alexdewar.\r\n\r\n- Removed dependency on `<memory>` for `std::allocator_traits` when possible (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3804). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n- Enabled compile-time checks in formatting functions that take text colors and styles.\r\n\r\n- Deprecated wide stream overloads of `fmt::print` that take text styles.\r\n\r\n- Made format string compilation work with clang 12 and later despite only partial non-type template parameter support (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/4000, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4001). Thanks @yujincheng08.\r\n\r\n- Made `fmt::iterator_buffer`'s move constructor `noexcept` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3808). Thanks @waywardmonkeys.\r\n\r\n- Started enforcing that `formatter::format` is const for compatibility with `std::format` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3447).\r\n\r\n- Added `fmt::basic_format_arg::visit` and deprecated `fmt::visit_format_arg`.\r\n\r\n- Made `fmt::basic_string_view` not constructible from `nullptr` for consistency with `std::string_view` in C++23 (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3846). Thanks @dalle.\r\n\r\n- Fixed `fmt::group_digits` for negative integers (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3891, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3901). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n- Fixed handling of negative ids in `fmt::basic_format_args::get` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3945). Thanks @marlenecota.\r\n\r\n- Improved named argument validation (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3817).\r\n\r\n- Disabled copy construction/assignment for `fmt::format_arg_store` and fixed moved construction (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3833). Thanks @ivafanas.\r\n\r\n- Worked around a locale issue in RHEL/devtoolset (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3858, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3859). Thanks @g199209.\r\n\r\n- Added RTTI detection for MSVC (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3821, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3963). Thanks @edo9300.\r\n\r\n- Migrated the documentation from Sphinx to MkDocs.\r\n\r\n- Improved documentation and README (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3775, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3784, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3788, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3789, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3793, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3818, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3820, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3822, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3843, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3890, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3894, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3895, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3905, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3942, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/4008).
