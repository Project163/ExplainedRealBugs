that's not what we're trying to do.\r\n\r\nWe have some types with `begin()` and `end()` but we specifically don't want them to be formatted as ranges. Including `fmt/ranges.h` breaks a lot of our codebase because there is now an ambiguous template instantiation: the \"detected\" range formatter as well as our custom formatter that we prefer to use (either via `format_as()` or by specializing the `formatter` type - both cause ambiguous instantiations).\r\n\r\nSee the godbolt link above which shows what I'm talking about. Commenting out the `ranges.h` header lets it compile, but we lose `fmt::join` in trunk.

issue #3839\r\n\r\nAn Eigen 3.4 2x2 matrix has a begin member function that returns void and a static_assert that evaluates to false (as you're not meant to call begin on a non-1d matrix). \r\nHowever this doesn't play nicely with the SFINAE checks at the moment in fmt as they simply perform a SFINAE check that the expression `T{}.begin()` is valid, which evaluating to `void` is (even though it's of course not a valid type for an iterator):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/75e892420ed84a058f0a494d693a6baf5212eac4/include/fmt/ranges.h#L100-L104\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo model a range more strictly to eliminate this case:\r\n\r\nIf we look at the c++20 concept for a [range](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges/range), it requires `ranges::begin` on the type, and that requires the iterator type satisfy [input_or_output_iterator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/iterator/input_or_output_iterator), which specifically notes that `begin` returns: `The exposition-only concept /*can-reference*/ is satisfied if and only if the type is referenceable (in particular, not void).`\r\n\r\nSo just check we can deref the result of that type to fix this case, and not incorrectly identify a type with `void begin/end` functions as a range. Note we don't want to do this for the type returned by `end`, as (in c++ >= 20) it may be a different sentinel type that is not
