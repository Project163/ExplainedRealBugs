(661b23edeb52d400cf5812e7330f14f05c072fab), but as far as I can see this affects all versions after June 2022 (b135f1c01449f6f41be3933437797e768b54295a).\r\n\r\nI am getting this error with clang-tidy 15.0.7 on Linux but the same error also occurs on the clang-tidy in compiler explorer (linked above).\r\n\r\nThe fix seems to be relatively straightforward, I will submit a pull
