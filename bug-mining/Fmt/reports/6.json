However, its base class `ArgVisitor` has a private declaration `typedef internal::Arg Arg` (at `format.h:1567`). So the compiler finds the private `Arg` and thinks it's not accessible.  \r\nI read the C++ standard and do not find that whether compiler should continue searching the namespace scope after finding a name that is not accessible.  \r\nI will seed a feedback to Visual Studio to find out is it a feature/bug of the compiler but I also want to get your opinions about changing the codes related to `internal::Args`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"foonathan","id":9192733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxOTI3MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9192733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/foonathan","html_url":"https://github.com/foonathan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foonathan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foonathan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foonathan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foonathan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foonathan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foonathan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foonathan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foonathan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foonathan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
