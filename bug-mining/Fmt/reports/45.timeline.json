The time point is converted to `seconds`; this could be dangerous since this is only required to hold at least 292 years worth of time, and we're asking for more in this case. In practice this works OK since `seconds` is typically implemented with a 64 bit signed integer, which gives plenty of space (a 32 bit signed integer would only provide 68 years worth of time, hence isn't allowed). But it's technically beyond what the standard guarantees. To be safe, we could use `std::chrono::duration<std::int64_t>` instead, which can hold up to 300 billions years worth of seconds.\r\n2. This is where the real issue is. `gmtime` implicitly converts the `time_point` back to the `system_clock::time_point`, which has nanosecond precision on linux, hence overflows. We can't use `system_clock::from_time_t`, since it always requires a `system_clock::time_point`. Thankfully, `system_clock` is defined to have the same epoch as `time_t` (only in C++20; but even though this wasn't defined pre-C++20, all implementations did this anyway). This means you can get a `time_t` by simply counting the number of seconds in the `time_point` since the epoch, which is what we have already.\r\n\r\nHence, simply using this alternative `gmtime` overload should solve the problem:\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate<typename Duration>\r\ninline std::tm gmtime(\r\n    std::chrono::time_point<std::chrono::system_clock, Duration> time_point) {\r\n  using large_seconds = std::chrono::duration<std::int64_t>;\r\n  return gmtime(std::chrono::time_point_cast<large_seconds>(time_point).time_since_epoch().count());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(and we can remove the `time_point_cast` in the formatter)\r\n\r\nNB: this is assuming that `time_t` is 64 bit; if it's not, we're in deeper trouble :)\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/comments/1825639678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cschreib-ibex","id":54102755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTAyNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54102755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib-ibex","html_url":"https://github.com/cschreib-ibex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib-ibex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib-ibex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib-ibex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib-ibex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib-ibex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib-ibex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib-ibex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib-ibex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib-ibex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/comments/1825767652","html_url":"https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3725#issuecomment-1825767652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3725","id":1825767652,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGurSs5s0wDk","user":{"login":"cschreib","id":2236577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzY1Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2236577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib","html_url":"https://github.com/cschreib","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cschreib/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-24T14:41:32Z","updated_at":"2023-11-24T14:41:32Z","body":"I

by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>-   Added support for the `%j` specifier (the number of days) for `std::chrono::duration` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3643, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3732). Thanks @intelfx.\r\n\r\n-   Added support for the chrono suffix for days and changed the suffix for minutes from \"m\" to the correct \"min\" (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3662, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3664). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/9KhMnq9ba)):\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    #include <fmt/chrono.h>\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n      fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", std::chrono::days(42)); // prints \"42d\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Thanks @Richardk2n.\r\n\r\n-   Fixed an overflow in `std::chrono::time_point` formatting with large dates (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3725, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3727). Thanks @cschreib.\r\n\r\n-   Added a formatter for `std::source_location` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3730). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/YajfKjhhr)):\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    #include <source_location>\r\n    #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n      fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", std::source_location::current());\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    prints\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    /app/example.cpp:5:51: int main()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Thanks @felix642.\r\n\r\n-   Added a formatter for `std::bitset` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3660). For example ([godbolt](https://godbolt.org/z/bdEaGeYxe)):\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    #include <bitset>\r\n    #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n      fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", std::bitset<6>(42)); // prints \"101010\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Thanks @muggenhor.\r\n\r\n-   Added an experimental `nested_formatter` that provides an easy way of applying a formatter to one or more subobjects while automatically handling width, fill and alignment. For example:\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    #include <fmt/format.h>\r\n\r\n    struct point {\r\n      double x, y;\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    template <>\r\n    struct fmt::formatter<point> : nested_formatter<double> {\r\n      auto format(point p, format_context& ctx) const {\r\n        return write_padded(ctx, [=](auto out) {\r\n          return format_to(out, \"({}, {})\", nested(p.x), nested(p.y));\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n      fmt::print(\"[{:>20.2f}]\", point{1, 2});\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    prints\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [          (1.00, 2.00)]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n-   Added the generic representation (`g`) to `std::filesystem::path` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3715, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3729). For example:\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    #include <filesystem>\r\n    #include <fmt/std.h>\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n      fmt::print(\"{:g}\\n\", std::filesystem::path(\"C:\\\\foo\"));\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    prints `\"C:/foo\"` on Windows.\r\n\r\n    Thanks @js324.\r\n\r\n-   Made `format_as` work with references (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3739). Thanks @tchaikov.\r\n\r\n-   Fixed formatting of invalid UTF-8 with precision (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3284).\r\n\r\n-   Fixed an inconsistency between `fmt::to_string` and `fmt::format` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3684).\r\n\r\n-   Disallowed unsafe uses of `fmt::styled` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3625):\r\n\r\n    ```c++\r\n    auto s = fmt::styled(std::string(\"dangle\"), fmt::emphasis::bold);\r\n    fmt::print(\"{}\\n\", s); // compile error\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    Pass `fmt::styled(...)` as a parameter instead.\r\n\r\n-   Added a null check when formatting a C string with the `s` specifier (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3706).\r\n\r\n-   Disallowed the `c` specifier for `bool` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3726, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3734). Thanks @js324.\r\n\r\n-   Made the default formatting unlocalized in `fmt::ostream_formatter` for consistency with the rest of the library (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3460).\r\n\r\n-   Fixed localized formatting in bases other than decimal (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3693, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3750). Thanks @js324.\r\n\r\n-   Fixed a performance regression in experimental `fmt::ostream::print` (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3674).\r\n\r\n-   Added synchronization with the underlying output stream when writing to the Windows console (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3668, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3688, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3689). Thanks @Roman-Koshelev and @dimztimz.\r\n\r\n-   Changed to only export `format_error` when {fmt} is built as a shared library (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3626, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3627). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n-   Made `fmt::streamed` `constexpr`. (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3650). Thanks @muggenhor.\r\n\r\n-   Enabled `consteval` on older versions of MSVC (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3757). Thanks @phprus.\r\n\r\n-   Added an option to build without `wchar_t` support on Windows (https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/issues/3631, https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/pull/3636).
