UBSAN reports this as a reference binding to a null pointer at [TestAllocator.allocate](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt/blob/b6011453/test/mock-allocator.h#L55). I think that this succeeds nevertheless because a typical `std::allocator<char>::allocate` does not use `this`, so it does not crash when `this` is null.","closed_by":{"login":"vitaut","id":576385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjM4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/576385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut","html_url":"https://github.com/vitaut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vitaut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fmtlib/fmt/issues/1344/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
