is an RNG unsuitable for applications where unpredictable randomness is required, making it a poor default choice. There are currently two reasons to choose it over `StdRng`:\r\n\r\n1. Better performance. I think this advantage can be rendered obsolete by using a state-of-the-art SIMD implementation of ChaCha, which has comparable performance (#667).\r\n2. Smaller state size. However, ChaCha is only 8.5 times larger than `StdRng`, making it a suitable choice even for embedded applications. Remaining applications are massively parallel calculations, where the small state size might still be preferable, but this seems like a very niche use case that could be supported by a different crate.\r\n\r\nOnce we use a good SIMD implementation of ChaCha, there are few use cases remaining where `SmallRng` would be preferable. I think we could remove it, which has the following advantages:\r\n\r\n1. Less API and code in `rand`.\r\n2. Only secure RNG options in `rand`, requiring a more explicit opt-in to use a predictable RNG (by using an additional crate).\r\n\r\nNote that the current implementation of `StdRng` is significantly slower and larger than `SmallRng`, so I don't think we should deprecate `SmallRng` just yet.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/767/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/484864973","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/667#issuecomment-484864973","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/667","id":484864973,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NDg2NDk3Mw==","user":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-19T11:30:26Z","updated_at":"2019-04-19T11:30:26Z","body":"@kazcw would you be open to adding `rand_core` support into your ChaCha implementation?

is basically forked from #850: a request to reduce the number of dependencies. This issue is opened for **discussion** since previously it did not have much. Also see: #667, #789.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, this crate has several dependencies of its own, and is also the only required dependency of `rand` (besides `getrandom`, `rand_core` and on some platforms `libc`):\r\n```\r\n    ├── rand_chacha v0.2.1\r\n    │   ├── c2-chacha v0.2.2\r\n    │   │   ├── lazy_static v1.4.0\r\n    │   │   └── ppv-lite86 v0.2.5\r\n    │   └── rand_core v0.5.0\r\n    │       └── getrandom v0.1.11 (*)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Probable resolution: no change\r\n\r\nWe don't *need* to change anything.\r\n\r\n### Possible resolution: subsume dependencies\r\n\r\nWe could copy some/all dependencies up into `rand_chacha`. Note that currently [c2-chacha](https://crates.io/crates/c2-chacha) has no other dependent crates, while [ppv-lite86](https://crates.io/crates/ppv-lite86) has two (both only used by the [powhasher](https://crates.io/crates/powhasher) miner, as far as I can tell).\r\n\r\nCC @kazcw\r\n\r\n### Other resolutions\r\n\r\nWe could revert back to HC-128 which has a fast implementation without use of SIMD intrinsics.\r\n\r\nWe could revert to the old ChaCha implementation or use the `chacha20` crate, however this would not be good for performance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/872/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/872/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
