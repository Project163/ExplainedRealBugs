It has been translated to use\r\n   modern C coding standards.\r\n   If n is small and/or p is near 0 or near 1 (specifically, if\r\n   n*min(p,1-p) < SMALL_MEAN), then a different algorithm, called\r\n   BINV, is used which has an average runtime that scales linearly\r\n   with n*min(p,1-p).\r\n   But for larger problems, the BTPE algorithm takes the form of two\r\n   functions b(x) and t(x) -- \"bottom\" and \"top\" -- for which b(x) <\r\n   f(x)/f(M) < t(x), with M = floor(n*p+p).  b(x) defines a triangular\r\n   region, and t(x) includes a parallelogram and two tails.
