However using wasm_bindgen to build towards __nodejs__ we get a build artifact with an unknown `require('env')`\r\n\r\nThe make file to run the building is: \r\n\r\n```make\r\nbuild-wasm-dev:\r\n\tcargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown; \\\r\n\tmkdir -p dist; \\\r\n\twasm-bindgen target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/ditto.wasm --out-dir ./dist --nodejs\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the created file looks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet imports = {};\r\nimports['./ditto'] = require('./ditto');\r\nimports['env'] = require('env'); // HERE, what is this?\r\n\r\n            const join = require('path').join;\r\n            const bytes = require('fs').readFileSync(join(__dirname, 'ditto_bg.wasm'));\r\n            const wasmModule = new WebAssembly.Module(bytes);\r\n            const wasmInstance = new WebAssembly.Instance(wasmModule, imports);\r\n            module.exports = wasmInstance.exports;\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore running in node throws an unknown `env` module error.\r\n\r\nThis seems to only happen when my Cargo.toml includes:\r\n```toml\r\nrand = {version = \"0.5.0\", features = ['stdweb']}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
