some discussion (https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/pull/347) we probably still want a `Bernoulli` distribution, that provides more than 32 bits of accuracy. I.e. that uses `rng.sample(HighPrecision01) < p`.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/377889836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pitdicker","id":6255050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUwNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6255050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker","html_url":"https://github.com/pitdicker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1551688540,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQxNTUxNjg4NTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/1551688540","actor":{"login":"pitdicker","id":6255050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUwNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6255050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker","html_url":"https://github.com/pitdicker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-02T09:04:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1551688909,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE1NTE2ODg5MDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/1551688909","actor":{"login":"pitdicker","id":6255050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUwNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6255050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker","html_url":"https://github.com/pitdicker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-02T09:04:36Z","label":{"name":"E-easy","color":"00FF00"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1551688911,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MTU1MTY4ODkxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/1551688911","actor":{"login":"pitdicker","id":6255050,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNTUwNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6255050?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker","html_url":"https://github.com/pitdicker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pitdicker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-02T09:04:36Z","label":{"name":"P-medium","color":"d46ad4"},"performed_via_git

follow up on the [release strategy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/issues/205#issuecomment-352272614) in #205, here is a rough plan for Rand 0.5:\r\n\r\n- [x] Merge PRNG code improvements #209\r\n- [x] Add `Hc128Rng` #210\r\n- [x] Add new error types #225\r\n- [x] Add `SeedableRng::from_rng` to replace `Rand` impls on PRNGs; update `seed` type #233\r\n- [x] Rename `IndependentSample` → `Distribution` and remove `Sample` #256\r\n- [x] Replace `Rand` with `Uniform` distribution #256\r\n- [x] Split `Rng` to `Rng: RngCore` #265\r\n- [x] Move `Rng` etc. to new `rand-core` crate [requires `SampleRng`; ~#264~ #288]\r\n- [ ] ~Add [`HalfOpen01` distribution](https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/85#issuecomment-372106822)~\r\n\r\nRelated issues which need solving:\r\n\r\n- [x] Naming of `try_fill_bytes`: https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/27\r\n- [x] Name of \"default\" distribution: `Uniform`; https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/81\r\n- [x] Distribution names: https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/81\r\n- [x] Fate of `Rand`: https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/83\r\n- [x] Re-exporting: https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/15\r\n- [x] Decide which `Distribution::sample` prototype to use #287\r\n- [x] Remove default implementations for `RngCore` methods?\r\n\r\nThere are some extra changes which should be relatively easy to add after the above:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add new floating-point sampling code #274 (partial)\r\n- [x] Add new `Range` code #274\r\n- [x] Add `CryptoRng: RngCore` extension trait #273\r\n- [x] Switch `thread_rng()` to `HC-128`? https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/53\r\n- [x] Optional logging support: https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/39, https://github.com/dhardy/rand/pull/43\r\n- [x] ~New iterator code~ #275 rejected; #286 merged\r\n\r\nDesired additions:\r\n\r\n- [x] Merge #96 (requires testing/review)\r\n- [x] Add `Bernoulli` distribution and `gen_bool` then deprecate `gen_weighted_bool` (see #293)\r\n\r\nFinally, a list of other planned changes, which probably won't make 0.5:\r\n\r\n- [x] Replace `gen_ascii_chars` with `Alphanumeric` distribution: #279\r\n- [ ] Revise character distributions (more classes, possible renaming): likely not desired\r\n- [ ] Add `SeedableRng::from_hashable`: https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/18, https://github.com/dhardy/rand/pull/62\r\n- [x] Change the RNG used by `StdRng`: https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/53\r\n- [ ] Change the RNG used by `weak_rng`: https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/60, https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/52\r\n- [ ] Publish one or more PRNG algorithm crates and remove `XorShiftRng`, `IsaacRng`, `ChaChaRng`, etc. from `rand` (don't export): https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/58\r\n- [ ] Revise `WeightedChoice` & sequences code: https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/82\r\n- [ ] Fork protection: https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/59\r\n- [x] Revise other Rng methods: gen_iter, gen_weighted_bool, gen_ascii_chars, choose, shuffle: #293, #286,
