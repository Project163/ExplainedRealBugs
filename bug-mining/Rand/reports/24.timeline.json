At least, there's no point using Rand without `std` if it's also used with `std` somewhere in your dependency tree.\r\n\r\nThe main issue here is that this can easily break the compilation for the downstream users without any visible semver bump.\r\n\r\nImagine this scenario:\r\n\r\n1. I depend on crate `foo` 1.0.0 and on crate `bar` 1.0.0.\r\n2. The crate `bar` depends on `rand` 0.5, `foo` is `#[no_std]` and depends on `rand` 0.5 without the `std` feature. Both of these have `rand` as an internal dependency which isn't externally visible.\r\n3. `foo` updates its internal dependency on `rand` to 0.6 and is published as 1.0.1.\r\n4. I try to compile my crate and suddenly it breaks as `cargo` will automatically fetch `foo` 1.0.1 (which now has `rand` 0.6 without the default features) along with `bar` 1.0.0 (which still has `rand` 0.5).\r\n\r\nThis breaks the usual expectation that 1) dependency X shouldn't break the compilation of a completely unrelated dependency Y, and 2) that you can simultaneously have two versions of the same crate in your crate graph.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't be a big of a deal for any random crate ('random' as in an arbitrarily picked crate which usually only have a few users on average, no pun intended :smiley:), but `rand` has 1883 other crates depending on it at this point in time.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/440359492/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"koute","id":246574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjU3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute","html_url":"https://github.com/koute","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/440401794","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/645#issuecomment-440401794","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/645","id":440401794,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDQwMTc5NA==","user":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-20T19:31:45Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T19:33:23Z","body":"> Adding a fake dependency on rand_core = 0.2.2 fixed the problem\r\n\r\nProbably `cargo update -p rand_core` would also fix it in this case.\r\n\r\n> Maybe the constraints for rand_core should be made more stringent on the lower bound so that v0.2.1 is not used?\r\n\r\nAs long as all versions of `rand_core` were 0.2 and < 0.2.2 there wouldn't be a problem — though the existence of `rand_core` 0.2.2 *is* to force everyone to upgrade, yes.\r\n\r\n@koute if `rand_core` 0.2.2 requires `std`, it should force `rand_core` 0.3 to use `std`.

Hopefully that would fix the issue.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/440401794/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1978282725,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTk3ODI4MjcyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/1978282725","actor":{"login":"koute","id":246574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjU3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute","html_url":"https://github.com/koute","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-20T19:31:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1978282726,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5NzgyODI3MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/1978282726","actor":{"login":"koute","id":246574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjU3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/246574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute","html_url":"https://github.com/koute","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koute/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-20T19:31:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/445994531","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/645#issuecomment-445994531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/645","id":445994531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTk5NDUzMQ==","user":{"login":"pohl","id":74958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0OTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pohl","html_url":"https://github.com/pohl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pohl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pohl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pohl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pohl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pohl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pohl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pohl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pohl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pohl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-10T22:13:59Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T22:14:33Z","body":"I encountered this today in my side project, and it manifested as the same error that dvdplm mentioned  above.
