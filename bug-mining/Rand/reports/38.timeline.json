Unfortunately `Once` is only available in `std`. This leaves us with three choices:\r\n\r\n1.  Restrict `ReseedingRng` (and the whole `adapter` module) to `#[cfg(feature=\"std\")]`. Since this is likely not of use in `no_std` and `thread_rng` is already resticted to `std` this is probably the best choice, however it necessitates a breaking release of Rand.\r\n2.  Only call the fork handler when on Unix *and* `cfg(feature = \"std\")`. (This combination doesn't technically need to exist, but thanks to the way `no_std` works is still a valid compile target, thus we shouldn't break it.)\r\n3.  Implement `Once` ourselves with a spin-lock.

IMO.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/557085589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2819646508,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjgxOTY0NjUwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/2819646508","actor":{"login":"bjorn3","id":17426603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI2NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17426603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3","html_url":"https://github.com/bjorn3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-21T13:31:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2819646509,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI4MTk2NDY1MDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/2819646509","actor":{"login":"bjorn3","id":17426603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI2NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17426603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3","html_url":"https://github.com/bjorn3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-11-21T13:31:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/557180631","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/911#issuecomment-557180631","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/911","id":557180631,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NzE4MDYzMQ==","user":{"login":"vks","id":33460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks","html_url":"https://github.com/vks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-21T17:06:09Z","updated_at":"2019-11-21T17:06:09Z","body":"Option
