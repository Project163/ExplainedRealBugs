of the links in our API documentation are currently simple relative paths.\r\n\r\n- For links within the same crate this works everywhere but is fragile (if the documented item moves into or out of a sub-module).\r\n- For links to other Rand crates this works for [our hosted documentation](http://rust-random.github.io/rand/) but not on docs.rs.\r\n- For links to items from other crates which are not dependencies but instead linked as a suggested alternative or usage, it may be confusing where to find that (e.g. see #646).\r\n\r\nThanks to [RFC 1946](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1946) we should be able to improve this.\r\n\r\nTo address the above, I think we should:\r\n\r\n- [x] Revise existing relative links to use Rust paths instead of file paths, according to the RFC\r\n- [x] Decide how to handle links to non-dependencies\r\n- [ ] Add notes to the [Book doc contributions guide](https://rust-random.github.io/book/contrib-doc.html)\r\n\r\nPart of this needs additional discussion: how do we link to things which are not dependencies correctly? Examples:\r\n\r\n- [`SeedableRng`](https://rust-random.github.io/rand/rand_core/trait.SeedableRng.html) mentions `rand::FromEntropy`\r\n- [`StdRng`](https://rust-random.github.io/rand/rand/rngs/struct.StdRng.html) references `rand_hc::Hc128Rng` and `rand_chacha::ChaChaRng`\r\n\r\nNote that we don't currently appear to have a technical solution to reliably link to all these, except with blunt absolute or relative links (see
