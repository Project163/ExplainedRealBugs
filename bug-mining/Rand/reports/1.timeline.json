is often used to generate seed for user-space PRNG. #279 adds unsafe raw API which allows to remove redundant initialization of buffers. So I wonder if it could be worth to introduce the following safe wrappers:\r\n```rust\r\npub fn getrandom_array<const N: usize>() -> Result<[u8; N], Error> {\r\n    let mut buf = mem::MaybeUninit::<[u8; N]>::uninit();\r\n    unsafe { getrandom_raw(buf.as_mut_ptr().cast(), N).map(|()| buf.assume_init()) }\r\n}\r\n\r\npub fn getrandom_u32() -> Result<u32, Error> {\r\n    getrandom_array().map(u32::from_ne_bytes)\r\n}\r\n\r\npub fn getrandom_u64() -> Result<u64, Error> {\r\n    getrandom_array().map(u64::from_ne_bytes)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// and maybe other wrappers for u16, u128, i32, i64, etc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, `getrandom_array` implies MSRV bump to 1.51, which could be done in sync with [`rand v0.9`](https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/1165).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/getrandom/issues/281/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/getrandom/issues/281/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/1323825219","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/1165#issuecomment-1323825219","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1165","id":1323825219,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAc09Ts5O5_hD","user":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-22T15:08:23Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T15:08:23Z","body":"**Question:

Avoiding breaking changes to `rand_core` lets users upgrade to Rand v0.9 more easily (no need to touch RNGs)\r\n- We may well make breaking changes to `RngCore` in the future, but likely not soon
