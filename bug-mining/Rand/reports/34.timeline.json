Currently, everything seems to work fine due to eager dependency resolution.

There's anecdotal evidence that wrong minimal versions actually are a problem: https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/8ob598/rust_minimum_versions_semver_is_a_lie/e027mtz/. \r\n\r\n- should we implement \"--minimal-versions-for-me-but-not-my-dependencies\" as well, to make the initial roll-out of this feature easier?\r\n\r\n**Stabilization TODO:**\r\n\r\n- change `-Z minimal-versions` to just `--minimal-versions` and add it alongside `--frozen/locked`,\r\n- this will require community-wide effort to make the things work, so a special announcement should be prepared.

one of the (co-)maintainers of the rand-* packages in debian.

am no longer happy about depending on the `rand` crates. There is too much churn, too many crates, and IMO, worst of all, there is no desire to [add a minimal version check to their CI](https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/741). Which means _anything_ that depends on `quickcheck` in turn cannot reliably have its own minimal version check.\r\n\r\nBecause I am tired of depending on `rand`, I have started removing it completely where possible. For example, in `walkdir`, I've [removed quickcheck as a dependency](https://github.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/commit/5d16163ce67245d07df0f913847b5f7a4c4c02b6). In ripgrep, I've [removed `tempfile` as a dependency](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/31807f805a793c254587105ca8ee0d41dfe3004b), because it in turn was the only thing bringing `rand` into ripgrep's dependency tree.\r\n\r\nI don't see any other path forward here. I can either continue to grin and bear `rand`, drop everything that depends on randomness, or figure out how to generate randomness without `rand`. Specifically, I'd very much like to add a minimal version check back to the `regex` crate, which catches bugs that happen in practice. (See [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/570) and [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/issues/593).) My sense is that there is some design space in the ecosystem for a simple source of randomness that doesn't need to be cryptographically secure, and an API that does not experience significant churn. Certainly, quickcheck does not need a cryptographic random number generator.\r\n\r\nWith that said, there is some infrastructure in the `rand` API that is incredibly useful. For example, quickcheck makes heavy use of the [`Rng::gen`](https://docs.rs/rand/0.7.0/rand/trait.Rng.html#method.gen) method for generating values based on type.\r\n\r\nSo it seems like if we have something like the `Rng` trait with with a non-cryptographic RNG, then we'd be probably good to go.\r\n\r\nAre there other avenues here? What have I missed? My experience in building infrastructure for randomness is pretty limited, so am I underestimating the difficulty involved here?\r\n\r\nAnother side to this question is whether any users of quickcheck are leveraging parts of the `rand` ecosystem that would be difficult or impossible to do if we broke ties with `rand`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/quickcheck/issues/241/reactions","total_count":21,"+1":21,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/quickcheck/issues/241/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/524864880","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/741#issuecomment-524864880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/741","id":524864880,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNDg2NDg4MA==","user":{"login":"nox","id":123095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzA5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox","html_url":"https://github.com/nox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-26T13:40:57Z","updated_at":"2019-08-26T13:40:57Z","body":"> I feel like testing the most recent lib version is more important than checking the minimal version; is it really worth having CI runs for _each_ platform (we have several platform-specific deps) to check both?\r\n\r\nIf a crate says it depends on foo 1.2.3 but it actually requires foo 1.3.0, that's a bug in that crate.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/524864880/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nox","id":123095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzA5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox","html_url":"https://github.com/nox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/525618607","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/741#issuecomment-525618607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/741","id":525618607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNTYxODYwNw==","user":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-28T07:24:48Z","updated_at":"2019-08-28T07:24:48Z","body":"@nox if a crate \"depends\" on version 1.2.3, Cargo would (by default) pick the latest 1.2.x version (≥1.2.3).\r\n\r\nIn contrast when talking about *patch* versions, any x.y.z with a newer x.y.w (w > z) is effectively obsolete.
