the original post see below the line. Deliverables tracker:\r\n\r\n- [x] Update the book (see [here](https://github.com/rust-random/book/issues/57#issuecomment-2082152738))\r\n- [x] #1379\r\n- [ ] `zeroize` feature?\r\n- [ ] Forward secrecy / key-erasure? \r\n- [ ] #934 (separate issue)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCross-posting [from here](https://github.com/rust-random/book/issues/57) for visibility — the book may document policy, but it affects the whole project.\r\n\r\n> I've seen a few projects use rand in security sensitive code.\r\n> A reviewer may eventually point them to this warning in the book:\r\n> https://github.com/rust-random/book/blame/master/src/guide-rngs.md#L263-L271\r\n> Inferring that rand does not provide cryptographically secure prngs and they should use a different random library.\r\n\r\nWell,\r\n\r\n- Rand is not in any way certified for cryptographic security.\r\n- `SeedableRng::from_entropy`, `OsRng` and the `getrandom` crate attempt to offer strong seeding from an external source\r\n- `CryptoRng` and `CryptoBlockRng` are type-level documentation that implementers are *supposed* to be cryptographically secure (unpredictable given past outputs), but don't require any direct protection of their state (e.g. I don't think our implementations attempt to zero their state on destruction)\r\n- `ThreadRng` builds on the above and includes periodic reseeding and periodic fork-detection, but this may be insufficient in some cases (e.g. perhaps we should add a method to force immediate fork-detection for use before key-generation or even allow bypassing its buffer for when secrecy is more important than performance).\r\n\r\n> Is this warning out of date?\r\n\r\nNot really; we don't have a formal policy.\r\n\r\nInstead Rand attempts to choose reasonable compromises between performance, security and usability for a general audience. It is not marketed as a cryptographic product, but is *hopefully* good enough not to be a major security flaw in case it is (mis)used as one.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if Rand *should* go beyond this, *unless* it were to move from a volunteer project to a professional one. That said, I do have some possible ideas for improvements:\r\n\r\n- Use `zeroize` around `ThreadRng` state\r\n- Add `fn rand::secret_rng` to access the inner RNG (bypass `ThreadRng`'s cache)\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/543, https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/882, https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/463\r\n\r\nCC @vks @newpavlov @josephlr @joshlf @tarcieri","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1358/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13589414861,"node_id":"LE_lADOAc09Ts4dJmBJzwAAAAMp_gPN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/13589414861","actor":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-20T11:44:42Z","label":{"name":"E-question","color":"00FF00"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13589420785,"node_id":"LE_lADOAc09Ts4dJmBJzwAAAAMp_hrx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/13589420785","actor":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-20T11:47:46Z","label":{"name":"X-security","color":"bfbfbf"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
