Sure, PCG has single-stream variants, but since one of the biggest reasons to use non-crypto RNGs is to allow multiple generators without hitting memory usage/bandwidth/cache too hard, a 64-bit generator without streams is not so useful.

are my personal requirements for picking a default small PRNG. It seems like we should have some set of requirements to apply to https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/52, beyond benchmarks.\r\n@dhardy, @vks: What do you think?\r\n\r\nA user should not need to worry about:\r\n- speed and memory;\r\n- not consuming to many results;\r\n- independently initialized RNGs having a chance of producing similar streams;\r\n- whether statistical biases it contains may or may not matter.\r\n\r\nThis translates to the following requirements, in RNG terms:\r\n- for small chaotic RNGs:\r\n    - minimal cycle length: ~2^50\r\n    - minimal state size: 128 bits\r\n    - minimal seed size: 128 bits, unless with a proven initialization routine.\r\n- for fixed-period RNGs: minimal period \r\n    - minimal period: ~2^128, or 2^64 with ~2^64 streams\r\n    - minimal seed size: 128 bits, unless with a proven initialization routine.\r\n- passes PractRand and BigCrush\r\n\r\nOther qualities to look for are:\r\n- not being trivially predictable;\r\n- reproducible results also on architectures with a different endianness;\r\n- reasonably good theoretical basis;\r\n- license that can be used in Rand.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Speed and memory\r\nThis seems like a clear requirement. What differentiates small fast RNGs from cryptographic ones, is that they are very fast and / or use much less memory. Between a dozen and up to twenty instructions seem to be the norm. Also a state of about 16 bytes is usually enough, and using more memory is wasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Not consuming to many results\r\nWhat should be the minimum amount of results that can be consumed?\r\nOn today's hardware, a fast RNG can generate about 2^32 results in just 4 seconds. In most cases it is not reasonable to expect a process to do little else than generate random numbers, at least not without also requiring them to be cryptographically secure. With the exception of simulations maybe. 2^47 results take about a day to be generated. It seems anything that can generate a usable range close to 2^50 seems good enough.\r\n\r\n- For small chaotic RNGs this means the minimal cycle length should be guaranteed to be greater than ~2^50. Not all designs have enough theory behind them to give guarantees about the minimal cycle length.\r\n- For RNGs with a fixed period, not the entire period can be returned as results. As argued in the PCG paper chapter 3.1 that would mean all results appear exactly the same number of times, while because of the generalized birthday problem there should be variations.\r\n- Also for the same problem the RNG needs more bits of state then the number of bits it outputs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Independently initialized RNGs having a chance of producing similar streams\r\nMany RNGs have only one period. When you pick some random initial state, there is a chance to end up in the same range as the results of another generator. Lets take a period of 2^128, and 2^48 as an upper limit for the expected amount of used results. It then takes about 2^32 random initializations to have a chance of 1 in a million to repeat part of an already used stream. See [this comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2152#issuecomment-336736512), although some numbers are off by a factor 1000. So a period of 128 bits seems like a minimum requirement.\r\n\r\nAn alternative is RNGs with a small period and support for multiple streams, like PCG (when using LCG as a base generator) and SplitMix offer. A period of only 2^64 is just about enough to have a chance of 1 in 2000 for _one_ new RNG to end up within the stream of _one_ other RNG. If the RNG has 2^63 possible streams like PCG, 2^27 initializations are possible before the stream has a change of 1 in 1000 of being the same. Conclusion: support for ~2^64 streams is just enough to make a period of ~2^64 good enough for worry-free initialization.\r\n\r\nAll the above relies on the RNG taking a seed that has as many bits as the log2 of the period, 128. If the RNG can only take less bits, initialization may still be worry-free if the RNG has a proven method to map that seed to a state that can not be in the usable range of another seed. An example could be initializing PCG with a fixed state, and a random u64 for the stream. With just a u64 it is possible to guarantee 2^22 initializations and still having a change of only 1 in a million of ending up in the same stream. I am not aware of any RNG that offers this, besides it being quite pointless.\r\n\r\nFor small chaotic RNGs it is not really possible to talk about periods. The sizes calculated above for periods should map to state sizes if the RNG is perfect. So the state of chaotic RNGs should be at least 128 bits. I am not yet clear on what guarantees are available for this category of RNGs. Especially how cycles effect the birthday problem when initializing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Whether statistical biases it contains may or may not matter\r\nThe standard way to evaluate the statistical quality of RNGs is through test suites, with PractRand and the BigCrush test from TestU01 being the current state of the art.\r\n\r\nMany small chaotic RNGs pass without problems, and are quite fast.\r\n\r\nFor RNG's with a fixed period the recipe seems to be: take a fast, low quality RNG as a base generator, and apply a permutation function. Only the simple base generators like Xorshift, LCG or a Wehl sequence fail quickly.\r\n\r\nWhether a statistical biases of an RNG matter, depends on how the generated values get used. For many uses a little bias of patterns does not matter. On the other hand, when it does matter but someone does not realize so, it is very hard to notice. The values appear random after all.\r\n\r\nRNGs that have a clear bill from BigCrush and PractRand can be used without worry. At least for all situations where there is no adversary that tries to predict the RNG, use cryptographic RNGs in such a case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Not being trivially predictable\r\nOn the PCG blog a post about [trivial predictability](http://www.pcg-random.org/posts/on-trivial-predictability.html) is worth a read. For some algorithms cryptographically secure PRNG are unnecessary heavy, while some difficulty predicting the next results is enough to deter adversaries. One example is randomized quicksort. Not being trivially predictable can be seen as a plus, but not a requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproducable results also on architectures with a different endianness\r\nEven more then cryptographic RNGs, simple RNGs are used in many situations that need reproducible results. Then endianness should not be a worry.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reasonably good theoretical basis\r\nIf the RNG has at least some theoretical background, requirements like the period size or cycle length can be proven. I would say we need those guarantees for the RNG do be made a default in Rand. While a published paper is nice, even comments in the source code with math that makes sense seem good enough for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n### License that can be used in Rand.\r\nOur licenses are MIT and Apache 2.0. For RNGs that means they should have compatible licenses, like MIT or public domain. Anything higher like BSD or GPL would need permission from the

Having been burnt by this family of algorithms once, I'm not eager to give it pride of place in numpy.

PCG generator used by Numpy has a significant amount self-correlation. That is, for each sequence generated from a seed there is a large number of correlated, nonoverlapping sequences starting from other seeds. By \"correlated\" I mean that interleaving two such sequences and testing the result you obtain failures that did not appear in each sequence individually.\r\n\r\nThe probability that two generators out of large set of terminals get two of those sequences is nonnegligible. Why this happens from a mathematical viewpoint is well known but it is explained here in detail: http://prng.di.unimi.it/pcg.pgp (see \"Subsequences within the same generator\").\r\n\r\nTo show this problem directly, I wrote this simple C program reusing the Numpy code: http://prng.di.unimi.it/intpcgnumpy.c . The program takes two 128-bit states of two generators (with the same LCG constant or \"stream\") in the form of high and low bits, interleaves their output and writes it in binary form. Once we send it through PractRand, we should see no statistical failure, as the two streams should be independent.

And if you consider the probability that they do not exactly start from the same state, but have significant overlapping correlating sequences, you need much less.\r\n\r\nAny sensible generator from the literature will *not* behave like that. You can choose adversarially any two starting states of MRG32k3a, SFC64, CMWC, xoshiro256++, etc., and as long as you generate nonoverlapping sequences you will not see the failures above. This is a major drawback that can pop up when a number of devices uses the generator and one assumes (as it should be) that pairwise those sequences should not show correlation. The correlation can induce unwanted behavior that is hard to detect.\r\n\r\nPlease at least document somewhere that the generator should not be used on multiple terminals or in a highly parallel environment.\r\n\r\nThe same can happen with different \"streams\", as the sequences generated by an LCG by changing the additive constant are all the same modulo a change of sign and an additive constant. You can see some discussion here: https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/907 and a full mathematical discussion of the problem here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05304

As part of [testing](https://github.com/rust-embedded/msp430-rt/blob/a886eb703d27b2c754574994384527bddc010609/macros/src/lib.rs#L428-L460) rust cross-compilation on a variety of hosts, I've found that `rand::rngs::SmallRng` returns the same output for different seeds on a `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` host. I'm not sure if this applies to other ARM hosts, even of the same architecture version (I'm using an [ASUS TinkerBoard](https://www.asus.com/us/Single-Board-Computer/Tinker-Board/) in this example). Nor am I sure this applies to other architectures; `x86_64` Windows and Linux seem fine.\r\n\r\n**Quick solution**: Compile on hosts besides `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` :).\r\n\r\n**Details**: Consider the following program, with the `small_rng` feature enabled. I've created a [small repo](https://github.com/cr1901/rand-bug) for convenience:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::{\r\n    sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering},\r\n    time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH},\r\n};\r\n\r\nuse rand::{Rng, SeedableRng};\r\n\r\nfn random_ident() -> (u64, u64, [u8; 16], String) {\r\n    static CALL_COUNT: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);\r\n\r\n    let secs = SystemTime::now()\r\n        .duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH)\r\n        .unwrap()\r\n        .as_secs();\r\n\r\n    let count: u64 = CALL_COUNT.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst) as u64;\r\n    let mut seed: [u8; 16] = [0; 16];\r\n\r\n    for (i, v) in seed.iter_mut().take(8).enumerate() {\r\n        *v = ((secs >> (i * 8)) & 0xFF) as u8\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    for (i, v) in seed.iter_mut().skip(8).enumerate() {\r\n        *v = ((count >> (i * 8)) & 0xFF) as u8\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    let mut rng = rand::rngs::SmallRng::from_seed(seed);\r\n    (secs, count, seed, (0..16)\r\n        .map(|i| {\r\n            if i == 0 || rng.gen() {\r\n                ('a' as u8 + rng.gen::<u8>() % 25) as char\r\n            } else {\r\n                ('0' as u8 + rng.gen::<u8>() % 10) as char\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n        .collect::<String>())\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    println!(\"{:?}\", random_ident());\r\n    println!(\"{:?}\", random_ident());\r\n    println!(\"{:?}\", random_ident());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` (and Windows for that matter), this small program returns two different random identifiers for different seeds, as expected:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwilliam@xubuntu-dtrain:~/Projects/debug/rand-bug$ cargo run\r\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.01s\r\n     Running
