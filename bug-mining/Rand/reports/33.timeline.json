rand could be modularised as follows:\r\n\r\n| component | dependencies |\r\n| -------------- | ------------------ |\r\n| `rand_core` | |\r\n| PRNG crates | core |\r\n| `rand_os` | core + std |\r\n| `JitterRng` | core + std |\r\n| `EntropyRng` | core + os + jitter + std |\r\n| `ThreadRng` | core + os + jitter + entropy + std + hc |\r\n| `seq` | core |\r\n| `distributions` | core |\r\n| `Rng` | core + seq + distributions |\r\n\r\nRoughly 30% of the current code comes under non-linear distributions, which is its own story (#290). For the rest I don't *think* there's sufficient utility for more crates.\r\n\r\nI regret accepting #643 as-is; it \"promises\" to support all `std` platforms yet fails on WASM with a compile error (#674, #678) and on any unsupported platforms. The reasons that is an issue are convoluted (probably involving users depending on `rand` with default features yet not needing them all), but the conclusion of #678 is that Rand should always build for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, failing if necessary at run-time.\r\n\r\nWe used to use run-time failure within `EntropyRng` but disable `OsRng` at compile time where unneeded. Practical solutions are:\r\n\r\n1. Restore the old behavior: `rand_os` must compile but without the `OsRng` struct on unsupported platforms. `EntropyRng` is currently available on all platforms but with run-time failure when no source is available, however it requires a complex `cfg` pattern in order to disable the missing `OsRng` dependency when not available; it would therefore make sense to have this in the same crate.\r\n2.  Enable `OsRng` on WASM, and use run-time failure on missing implementation.\r\n3.  Enable `OsRng` on all platforms, and use run-time failure on missing implementation.\r\n\r\nI think the cleanest solution would be (1), but @tarcieri @naftulikay I understand there would be resistance to moving `JitterRng` into `rand_os`. Is this really justified? I guess in part this depends on whether the RFC proposed in #648 gets accepted, though this will be a while coming.\r\n\r\nOtherwise we can do (2) or (3); the difference is that (2) would cause build failures on any platform where Rand is used with `std`/default features but `OsRng` is unavailable. I'm not sure whether this is a good idea?\r\n\r\nI suppose (2) is most sensible now.\r\n\r\nCC @newpavlov @burdges ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/681/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/455131380","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/699#issuecomment-455131380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/699","id":455131380,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTEzMTM4MA==","user":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-17T10:59:57Z","updated_at":"2019-01-17T10:59:57Z","body":"Thanks for splitting this out into a new issue.\r\n\r\nAt this point I can only agree that we should be cautious about considering `JitterRng` secure.

is getting a rare but recurring crash on Windows due to OsRng failing to initialize.\r\n\r\nThe bug is being tracked [here](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1385971), and you can see the crash reports [here](https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/signature/?signature=core%3A%3Aresult%3A%3Aunwrap_failed%3CT%3E%20%7C%20std%3A%3Acollections%3A%3Ahash%3A%3Amap%3A%3A%7B%7Bimpl%7D%7D%3A%3Anew%3A%3AKEYS%3A%3A__init&date=%3E%3D2017-09-21T22%3A48%3A00.000Z&date=%3C2017-09-28T22%3A48%3A00.000Z&_columns=moz_crash_reason&_sort=-date&page=1#summary)\r\n\r\nSince the crash message isn't public on that page, just to give an idea, these are the kinds of crash reasons we have:\r\n\r\n - `failed to create an OS RNG: Error { repr: Os { code: 127, message: \"OS Error 127 (FormatMessageW() returned error 15100)\" } }` (15100 is `ERROR_MUI_FILE_NOT_FOUND`, i.e. it's unable to find the strings file to return the translated error message)\r\n - `failed to create an OS RNG: Error { repr: Os { code: 127, message: \"OS Error 127 (FormatMessageW() returned error 5)\" } }` (5 is `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`, so the translation string file is)\r\n - `failed to create an OS RNG: Error { repr: Os { code: -2146893801, message: \"Provider type not defined.\" } }`\r\n   - `failed to create an OS RNG: Error { repr: Os { code: -2146893801, message: \"Tipo de proveedor no definido.\" } }` and basically the same thing in different languages\r\n - `failed to create an OS RNG: Error { repr: Os { code: -2146893818, message: \"Invalid Signature.\" } }`\r\n\r\nThe FormatMessage errors are not a problem, they just mean that the formatter was unable to figure out what the error message was -- if we hit that we're erroring out already.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe actual OS error seems to mostly be error code 127 (`ERROR_PROC_NOT_FOUND`). I believe `-2146893801` is also one of these with some extra flags set. This is concerning; it doesn't seem like this should _happen_, because we are only feeding known system crypto provider (`PROV_RSA_FULL`) to `CryptAcquireContextA`. I'm unsure what the \"invalid signature\" error is about.\r\n\r\nThis might just be system DLLs being broken, but it's occurring regularly enough (we have a almost thousand crash reports) that we're having to work around it by disabling RandomState on systems where this doesn't work (which we can do because we've already forked HashMap for fallible allocations). Furthermore, Firefox code uses `CryptAcquireContext` and `CryptGenRandom` in a bunch of places and those don't seem to be particularly crashy.\r\n\r\nWe should see if this is an issue on our side, or perhaps make OsRng (or perhaps just `RandomState`'s initializer?) more resilient to this (perhaps with a more expensive

[getrandom crate](https://github.com/rust-random/getrandom/) is close to initial release, which means we can almost start building on it. This means:\r\n\r\n- `rand_os::OsRng` will become a thin wrapper around `getrandom`\r\n- either we have to map `getrandom::Error` values to `rand_core::Error` values, or replace the latter completely (suggested in #715)\r\n- the `rand_os` crate will become trivially small\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn #715 we have talked about other possible changes:\r\n\r\n- the `getrandom` crate should handle other sources on embedded platforms\r\n- we no longer appear to need a fallback in case of OS failure\r\n- therefore `EntropyRng` is no longer needed\r\n- we could replace `rand::FromEntropy::from_entropy` with `rand_core::SeedableRng::from_entropy`\r\n\r\nHere I would like to add a caveat: we have no proof that a fallback entropy source is not needed. @tarcieri has pointed out in #699 that we cannot be confident of the security of `JitterRng`, however there is also resistance to merely switching to RDRAND (partly since it is not available on all platforms, and in part based on the belief that we shouldn't need any fallback).\r\n\r\nWhat we do *not* want to do is remove `EntropyRng` only to find that we need to add it back again, meanwhile there is strong resistance to the idea of including a fallback within `getrandom`. This means that for now we should either keep `EntropyRng` (even if it is merely a wrapper) or plan to put any needed fallback within `OsRng`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it seems clear that we don't want to move the `JitterRng` code into `rand_core`, and we cannot make `rand_core` depend on `rand_jitter` circularly. The same applies to the `rdrand` crate. Thus the only option for including a fallback within `rand_core` would be a direct RDRAND implementation, which we probably also don't want.\r\n\r\nLike it or not, this means that we cannot move `OsRng` or `from_entropy` into `rand_core` *unless* we can prove that we don't need a fallback.\r\n\r\nNow, *if* we want to pursue a no-fallback entropy source, we could try removing all fallbacks for Rand 0.7 and watch for error reports. However, I'm not sure whether we want to do so (personally I agree with @cpeterso that Rand should [\"just work\"](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44911#issuecomment-464170709)).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis means we have to look at other options for now:\r\n\r\n1.  Keep `rand_os` with just `OsRng` even though this is essentially an empty crate\r\n2.  Move `EntropyRng` to `rand_os` (@burdges suggestion)\r\n3.  Drop `rand_os` and go back to `rand::rngs::OsRng`\r\n\r\nProposal: 2: move `EntropyRng` and `FromEntropy` to `rand_os` for now, keeping re-exports in `rand`, add `rdrand` as a fallback option, and put both `jitter` and `rdrand` behind feature flags (disabled by default).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/484856431","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/699#issuecomment-484856431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/699","id":484856431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NDg1NjQzMQ==","user":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-19T11:16:58Z","updated_at":"2019-04-19T11:16:58Z","body":"Update:
