part of `rand` has needed work for a while, and hasn't had much love recently, excepting the excellent work on `seq::sample*` by @vitiral.\r\n\r\n[`WeightedChoice`](https://docs.rs/rand/0.4.2/rand/distributions/struct.WeightedChoice.html) is a distribution for sampling one item from a slice, with weights. The current API only accepts a slice (reference) and clones objects when sampling.\r\n\r\nThe [`seq` module](https://docs.rs/rand/0.4.2/rand/seq/index.html) has functions to:\r\n- sample a set number of items from an iterator of unknown length, returning some of the iterated items\r\n- sample a set number of items from a slice, returning clones of the items\r\n- sample a set number of items from a slice, returning references into the original slice\r\n\r\nIssues to solve:\r\n- [ ] Is this sufficiently generic/flexible? Do we cover all expected functionality?\r\n- [ ] Is the code succinct?\r\n- [ ] Is the documentation sufficient?\r\n- [ ] Why are `WeightedChoice` and `seq::*` in completely separate modules, the first as a distribution the second as simple functions?\r\n- [ ] Is there excess functionality which arguably doesn't belong in `rand`?\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n- [implementation of `seq::*`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/pull/195)\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/issues/203 [opt]: investigate using sample_iter instead of sample_indicies_inplace\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/issues/169 [alg]: sampling with randomised ordering\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/issues/202 [API]: investigate generic `sample_indicies`\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/issues/142 [API]: `WeightedChoice` is hard to use with borrow checker\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/issues/90 [API]: Consider adding an owned version of WeightedChoice\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/pull/152 [API PR]: Add an owned variant of WeightedChoice\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/issues/110 [API+alg]: [`RandomChoice`](https://github.com/StefanoD/Rust_Random_Choice) impl\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/issues/47 [API]: Consider pruning gen_weighted_bool\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/pull/198 [API+alg PR]: Add `Rng::pick` / `Choose`\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rand/issues/116 [doc]: no doc for algorithm complexity\r\n- Partial refactoring I did in this branch: [API doc](https://dhardy.github.io/rand/rand/sequences/index.html) (makes `WeightedChoice` owning, adds `Choose`, some reorganisation)\r\n\r\nI'm going to say nothing is fixed at this point.

remove.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/370211045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/374172648","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/47#issuecomment-374172648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/47","id":374172648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDE3MjY0OA==","user":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-19T10:53:21Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T10:53:21Z","body":"#308
