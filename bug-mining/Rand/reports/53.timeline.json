this just came up: #1362. It appears to me that fork reseeding works *exactly* as advertised, but that someone mis-understood what those advertisements are.\r\n\r\nTo recap:\r\n\r\n- We could just *not* have any form of fork protection, but at some point...\r\n- Realised that adding **periodic** fork-detection and reseeding is practically free...\r\n- However this falls short of the type of immediate detection-and-reseed that would be expected in an entropy source intended for security applications.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that a compromise is worse than not having fork-detection at all? Should we just remove all documentation of this capability?\r\n\r\nThis argument could be taken further: periodic reseeding (without fork) might be a useful feature in some contexts, but from a security point of view it means almost nothing: if the seeds were ever insecure or state was ever leaked then the system may already be compromised.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo, should:\r\n\r\n- Rand explicitly be for non-cryptographic only?

(Though as said above, it might get mis-used anyway.)\r\n- Offering opt-in via feature flags might seem like the best of both worlds, but it's a hazard and in some ways the worst of both (might get forgotten/missed; no fine-grained control over usage).\r\n- Who stands behind the `rand` lib?

We don't even ask for donations, and one of the reasons I would not be comfortable doing so is that where people give, they might expect something in return. ...\r\n- ... In other words, *should* we look for a company willing to stand behind the project and offer some level of verification? (This would necessarily have an impact on the nature of the project, likely with reduced interest in accepting PRs from the community.)\r\n\r\nI've been pondering this over the last couple of weeks, and while we likely should clarify docs I'm less sure about other changes. But, I would like to hear others' opinions, especially that of frequent contributors or reviewers (but also of users).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/1860006090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11274508449,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAc09Ts54hVwjzwAAAAKgA1ih","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/11274508449","actor":{"login":"nstilt1","id":43357580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzU3NTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43357580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1","html_url":"https://github.com/nstilt1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-18T10:10:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11274508462,"node_id":"SE_lADOAc09Ts54hVwjzwAAAAKgA1iu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/11274508462","actor":{"login":"nstilt1","id":43357580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzU3NTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43357580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1","html_url":"https://github.com/nstilt1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-18T10:10:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/1860542309","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/1358#issuecomment-1860542309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1358","id":1860542309,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAc09Ts5u5Z9l","user":{"login":"tarcieri","id":797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri","html_url":"https://github.com/tarcieri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tarcieri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-18T13:45:23Z","updated_at":"2023-12-18T13:45:23Z","body":"I

It should be possible to have a common `fill_bytes()` method, and then a function signature for a generate as `unsafe fn generate(dest_ptr: *mut u8, num_blocks: usize)`. One benefit of this is that using `fill_bytes()` to fill an array with more than `BLOCK_SIZE * n` bytes, most of, if not all of the bytes could be written directly to the array, skipping the buffer. It mainly depends on the RNG's index and the size of the destination array.\r\n\r\nThe `num_blocks` parameter is especially useful when there are SIMD backends that are capable of generating more than 1 block at a time. It can also assist with the use of hardware-dependent buffer sizes by calling `self.core.generate(self.buffer.as_mut_ptr() as *mut u8, BUF_BLOCKS);`.\r\n\r\nEdit: Well, it turns out that it is fairly difficult to make a variable-sized buffer at runtime for x86/x86_64 instead of compile time.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/1863765077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nstilt1","id":43357580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzU3NTgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43357580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1","html_url":"https://github.com/nstilt1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nstilt1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/1921154587","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/1358#issuecomment-1921154587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1358","id":1921154587,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAc09Ts5ygn4b","user":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-01T11:53:19Z","updated_at":"2024-04-29T08:03:16Z","body":"# thread_rng\r\n\r\n### Fork protection\r\n\r\nQuite likely the best option here is to not attempt to provide any fork protection at all (or at least to remove mention of this in the docs).

Maybe we should introduce an additional marker trait for it?\r\n\r\nWe briefly mention *forward secrecy* in [the book](https://rust-random.github.io/book/guide-rngs.html#cryptographically-secure-pseudo-random-number-generators-csprngs); namely that none of our RNGs provide it (except `OsRng` which is stateless).\r\n\r\n- Should we add an RNG with forward secrecy? I'm inclined to recommend usage of `OsRng` where it matters, but not too knowledgeable on the topic. (As I see, it's a trade-off between performance and damage limitation, where `OsRng` is the slowest/most secure option and something like `ChaCha12Rng` is at the other end of what can still claim to be a secure generator. A key-erasure CSPRNG would presumably be somewhere in between.)\r\n- Should we add a marker trait for this capability?\r\n\r\nWithout persuasion to the contrary, my answer to both of the above is *no*.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMy conclusion: we can close this issue now; #934 already tracks the only remaining change I'd like to see.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/2082193633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12639704317,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAc09Ts54hVwjzwAAAALxYpT9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/12639704317","actor":{"login":"newpavlov","id":329626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTYyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/329626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov","html_url":"https://github.com/newpavlov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-29T08:55:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12639704333,"node_id":"SE_lADOAc09Ts54hVwjzwAAAALxYpUN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/12639704333","actor":{"login":"newpavlov","id":329626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTYyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/329626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov","html_url":"https://github.com/newpavlov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/newpavlov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-29T08:55:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/2084283872","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/1358#issuecomment-2084283872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1358","id":2084283872,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAc09Ts58O6Xg","user":{"login":"josephlr","id":5506060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDYwNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5506060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephlr","html_url":"https://github.com/josephlr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephlr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephlr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephlr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephlr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephlr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephlr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephlr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephlr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/josephlr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-30T02:55:26Z","updated_at":"2024-04-30T02:55:26Z","body":"@dhardy I agree with the points above.
