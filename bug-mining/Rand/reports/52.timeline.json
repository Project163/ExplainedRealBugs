That loop will require roughly `spacing(low)/(2*spacing(scale))` iterations to complete, where `spacing(x)` is the unit of least precision of `x`.

[x] Added a `CHANGELOG.md` entry\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nFix #1299 by removing logic specific to ensuring that we emulate a closed range by excluding `high` from the result.\r\n\r\n# Motivation\r\n\r\nFix #1299.\r\n\r\nAdditional motivation: floating-point types are approximations of continuous (real) numbers. Although one might expect that `rng.gen_range(0f32..1f32)` is strictly less than `1f32`, it can also be seen as an approximation of the real range `[0, 1)` which includes values whose nearest approximation under `f32` is `1f32`.\r\n\r\nIn general, one can always expect that floating-point numbers may round up/down to the nearest representable value, hence this change is not expected to affect many users.\r\n\r\n`sample_single` was changed (see below) as a simplification, and to match the new behaviour of `new`.\r\n\r\n# Details\r\n\r\nSpecific to floats (i.e. `UniformFloat`),\r\n\r\n- `new` sets `scale = high - low` (unchanged) then ensures that `low + scale * max_rand <= high` (previously: ensure `< high`)\r\n- `new_inclusive` sets `scale = (high - low) / (1 - ε)` then ensures that `low + scale * max_rand <= high` (unchanged)\r\n- `sample_single` is now equivalent to `sample_single_inclusive` (previously: use rejection sampling to ensure `sample < high`)\r\n- `sample_single_inclusive` is unchanged: it yields `low + (high-low) * Standard.samgle(rng)`\r\n\r\nNote: `new` attempts to ensure that `high` may be yielded; `sample_single_inclusive` does not. This has not changed, but is a little surprising.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13518797603,"node_id":"CE_lADOAc09Ts5gUMY_zwAAAAMlyHsj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/13518797603","actor":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-16T10:32:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13518797617,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAc09Ts5gUMY_zwAAAAMlyHsx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/13518797617","actor":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1e381d13ee060f678c9a4ca54124ab8af30b4402","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/commits/1e381d13ee060f678c9a4ca54124ab8af30b4402","created_at":"2024-07-16T10:32:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
