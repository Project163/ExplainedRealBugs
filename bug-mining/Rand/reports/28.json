But the implementation seems to be `O(n)`. Is this a documentation error?\r\n\r\nAlso, what does \"Depending on the implementation, complexity is expected to be\" mean, exactly? Complexity is either specified or depends on the implementation. This question stays for functions like `SliceRandom::choose`.
