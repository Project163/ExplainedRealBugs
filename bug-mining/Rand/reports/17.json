Users are likely to see unexpected and hard-to-reproduce bugs if the returned value on rare occasions will be outside of the specified limits.\r\n\r\nOne example that I ran into was while implementing `choose_weighted` for dhardy/rand#82. If the generated number can be slightly higher than `high`, that means that we risk iterating through the whole item-set without selecting any item to return.\r\n\r\nThe simplest approach is to simply check the generated value against high/low and loop if it doesn't fit withing the desired boundaries. However that runs into problem when `scale` rounds to infinity, since then we'll just loop forever.\r\n\r\nLooking into some alternative approaches instead.","closed_by":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
