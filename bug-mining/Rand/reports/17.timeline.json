top of the existing `Rng.choose()` and `Rng.choose_mut()`, this implements `Rng.choose_from_iterator()`, `Rng.choose_weighted()`, `Rng.choose_weighted_with_total()`, `SliceRandom.choose()`, `SliceRandom.choose_mut()`, and `IteratorRandom.choose()`.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegarding the `vec.shuffle(rng)` vs. `rng.shuffle(vec)` issue, my strategy for where to stick functions was basically:\r\n* Stick all functions on the `Rng` trait. Since this helps with documentation and discoverability.\r\n* For functions that can reasonably be used in chains like `get_stuff().do_random_op(&mut rng).do_other_stuff()`, I've also added functions on `SliceRandom` and `IteratorRandom` which forward to the implementation on the `Rng` trait.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a reasonable trade-off to me. But happy to discuss more.\r\n\r\nAlso, this patch relies on that issue #476 will be fixed. Otherwise using floating point weights will on very rare occasions panic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1671695172,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2NzE2OTUxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/1671695172","actor":{"login":"sicking","id":1831914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzE5MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1831914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking","html_url":"https://github.com/sicking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a4c6b659d3c8eb30aa6e62ce8cb7f58d301aa7be","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sicking/rand/commits/a4c6b659d3c8eb30aa6e62ce8cb7f58d301aa7be","created_at":"2018-06-08T20:03:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1671935038,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2NzE5MzUwMzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/1671935038","actor":{"login":"sicking","id":1831914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzE5MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1831914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking","html_url":"https://github.com/sicking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8828cad87ef6ce8fae87ca158c192f27f43ac071","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sicking/rand/commits/8828cad87ef6ce8fae87ca158c192f27f43ac071","created_at":"2018-06-08T22:47:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1675207595,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2NzUyMDc1OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/1675207595","actor":{"login":"sicking","id":1831914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzE5MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1831914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking","html_url":"https://github.com/sicking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3b1ab6e86198ff50f92431420237b69db2e42d7b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sicking/rand/commits/3b1ab6e86198ff50f92431420237b69db2e42d7b","created_at":"2018-06-12T01:24:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1683952604,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2ODM5NTI2MDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/events/1683952604","actor":{"login":"sicking","id":1831914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzE5MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1831914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking","html_url":"https://github.com/sicking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sicking/starred
