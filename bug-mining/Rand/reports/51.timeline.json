need to update my weighted indices inside a hot loop. Instead of reconstructing the entire index from scratch, this commit allows updating the inner cumulative weights in-place using a slice of weights via `WeightedIndex::assign_weights`. WeightedIndex::assign_weights_unchecked` is also provided in those cases where the user promises that all weights are valid and their sum exceeds zero.\r\n\r\n# Open questions\r\n\r\nHow to handle a partial update? If assignment fails during `WeightedIndex::assign_weights`, the index can be left in a partially updated undefined state. The method's doc comment notes that but does not go further than that. I see the following ways to handle this:\r\n\r\n1. Leave things as they are. Users of `assign_weights` read the documentation and will keep this caveat in mind.\r\n2. Roll back the changes by using e.g. `SubAssign`. This will probably require keeping around the old cumulative weights, which implies an extra allocation in the function body, which goes against the point of this new feature.\r\n3. Add a field `has_errored: bool` to `WeightedIndex`, initialized to `false`. If an error is encountered during assignment, set to `true`. If `WeightedIndex` is used for sampling with `has_errored == True`, panic. I don't recall where I have seen this, but I believe this solution is even used somewhere in the standard library.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/948597800","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/1195#issuecomment-948597800","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1195","id":948597800,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAc09Ts44inQo","user":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-21T13:06:53Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T13:06:53Z","body":"Follow up change: `WeightedIndex::new` and `assign_weights` (whatever it gets called) should be updated to account for `Uniform::new` returning a `Result`.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/948597800/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dhardy","id":134893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy","html_url":"https://github.com/dhardy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhardy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/comments/950382443","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-random/rand/issues/1195#issuecomment-950382443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/1195","id":950382443,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAc09Ts44pa9r","user":{"login":"kazcw","id":1047859,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDc4NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1047859?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazcw","html_url":"https://github.com/kazcw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazcw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazcw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazcw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazcw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazcw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazcw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazcw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazcw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kazcw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-24T19:38:01Z","updated_at":"2021-10-24T19:38:01Z","body":"I agree that this should be done now or never, and IMO it's better to have a breaking change now than have this be an inconsistency in the API forever.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf the error type exposes the distinction between `EmptyRange` and `NonFinite`, we should assume people will rely on that distinction, and commit to a policy about which error code will be returned when both have occurred. Preferably, this policy should be the same between debug and release builds, without imposing a performance burden that we currently avoid by making finer distinctions in `debug_assert`s only. I think designing and implementing such a policy would be *possible*, but not trivial.\r\n\r\nI propose avoiding that hullabaloo by returning an opaque error type. The type's debug output can include details about the exact error encountered, which would be as informative to a debugging developer as the current assert approach; if it's ever decided in the future that users actually do need to distinguish these cases programmatically, an accessor could be added in a backward-compatible manner in the style of

solution does not need to preclude other crates from implementing `UniformSampler`.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to make `UniformSampler::new` fallible, right? Presumably something like this:\r\n```rust\r\npub trait UniformSampler {\r\n    // The possible errors vary for different types, and we cannot anticipate the classes of errors\r\n    // for all implementors of the trait, so this is an associated type.\r\n    type Error: Display;\r\n    fn new<B1, B2>(low: B1, high: B2) -> Result<Self, Self::Error>;\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<X: SampleUniform> Uniform<X> {\r\n    fn new<B1, B2>(low: B1, high: B2) -> Result<Self, X::Error> { ... }\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\npub struct InvalidFloatRange(FloatRangeError);\r\nenum FloatRangeError {\r\n    Empty,\r\n    Infinite,\r\n}\r\nimpl Display for FloatRangeError {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n// In the macro defining floating point samplers:\r\nimpl UniformSampler for UniformFloat<$Ty> {\r\n    type Error = FloatRangeError;\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\npub struct EmptyRange;\r\n// In the macro defining integer samplers:\r\nimpl UniformSampler for UniformInt<$Ty> {\r\n    type Error = EmptyRange;\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, the question is whether, in a case like `InvalidFloatRange` where more than one reason for failure is possible, we:\r\n1.
