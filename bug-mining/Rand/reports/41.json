It is not a good choice when security against prediction or reproducibility are important. ... The algorithm is deterministic but should not be considered reproducible due to dependence on platform and possible replacement in future library versions.\r\n\r\nIdeally (in my opinion), `SmallRng` should be *small* but not *too small*; preferably 128-bit or 256-bit if we must.  @vigna have you thoughts on this (given that you recommend a 256-bit variant of your generator for general usage, but in this case we already have a ChaCha-based generator for general usage)?\r\n\r\nThere are other generators besides PCG and Xo(ro)shiro, e.g. GJrand, JSF and SFC, though I've seen less analysis of these. Previous decisions on this topic have been somewhat influenced by [this thread](https://github.com/dhardy/rand/issues/60), though it only considers benchmarks and some very basic analysis.","closed_by":{"login":"vks","id":33460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks","html_url":"https://github.com/vks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/910/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-random/rand/issues/910/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
