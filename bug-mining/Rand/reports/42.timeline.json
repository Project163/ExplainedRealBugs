my example I have composible filters and rankers. Most of them fall back to a random selector if they can't narrow it down to one choice. However it is surprising when you have a filter that shouldn't have an effect do something. For example:\r\n\r\n- Adding a filter that logically shouldn't change anything due to known state or being less selective than previous filters. \r\n- A debugging filter that collects the iterator in order to make more intelligent printing decisions, then forwards the `Vec.into_iter()`. \r\n\r\nIt also means that seemingly noop changes such as refactoring to avoid collecting the iterator will change the result which makes it harder to validate that the change is correct.
