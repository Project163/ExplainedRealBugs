So the dependency should be updated to require a newer version of libc.\r\n\r\nThere may be other issues lurking as well, see: https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/issues/312\r\n\r\nThe regex crate does this check in its CI configuration to make sure its dependency specifications are always correct.
