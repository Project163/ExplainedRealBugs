Escaping keys is a serialization matter when a Properties object is written to something other than memory. So, if you do:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class TestObject {\r\n\tMap<String, String> values = new HashMap<>();\r\n\tpublic Map<String, String> getValues() {\r\n\t\treturn values;\r\n\t}\r\n\tpublic void setValues(Map<String, String> values) {\r\n\t\tthis.values = values;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n[...]\r\n@Test\r\n\tpublic void test() throws Exception {\r\n\t\tTestObject expected = new TestObject();\r\n\t\texpected.values.put(\"foo:bar\", \"1\");\r\n\t\tProperties properties = mapper.writeValueAsProperties(expected);\r\n\t\tTestObject actual = mapper.readPropertiesAs(properties, TestObject.class);\r\n\t\tassertThat(actual.values).isEqualTo(expected.values);\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fails because the properties object already contains the key escaped as ```foo\\:bar```, but readProperties expects that it doesn't. The properties itself, will add another backslash if it's about to be written to an actual file.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/91/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/91/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
