The input stream isn't closed properly unlike the regular JSON parser which does close.\r\n\r\nThis came up in a scenario when we read a properties file to create the object and later needed to delete the file.\r\n\r\nOnly seems to happen under Windows 10 (Linux is NOT impacted). Java version is 8 using Open JDK 8 u242 b08. \r\n\r\nAttached a zip file with a small maven project created in IntelliJ demonstrating the issue. Run \"compile\" to ensure the resources (.json, .properties files) are copied to the target folder before each run. \r\n\r\n[jackson-testing.zip](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/files/4325288/jackson-testing.zip)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/179/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
