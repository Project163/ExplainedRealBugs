#1321\r\n\r\nA better fix would be to change `MessageBody` to take a `Pin<&mut\r\nSelf>`, rather than a `&mut self`. This will avoid requiring the\r\nuse of `Box` for all consumers by allowing the caller to determine how\r\nto pin the `MessageBody` implementation (e.g. via stack pinning).\r\n\r\nHowever, doing so is a breaking change that will affect every user of\r\n`MessageBody`. By pinning the inner stream ourselves, we can fix the\r\nundefined behavior without breaking the API.\r\n\r\nI've included @sebzim4500's reproduction case as a new test case.\r\nHowever, due to the nature of undefined behavior, this could pass (and\r\nnot segfault) even if underlying issue were to regress.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, until rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines#148 is resolved,\r\nit's not
