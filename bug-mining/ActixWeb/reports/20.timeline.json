 I waited for @robjtede if he's ok but I totally agree with him - this needs to be documented somewhere (it also goes with your goal to reduce issues).  \r\nI'd maybe go for new paragraph [in `Response` docs](https://actix.rs/docs/response/), explaining that `Content-Length` is set up automatically and it cannot be forced to some value, however, it's compliant with RFC and sets the value accordingly when responding to HEAD - or better, explain responding to HEAD more thoroughly.\r\n\r\nJust one more question now crossed my mind:\r\nYou've said `You don't need to set the content-length`. I felt like I _cannot_ set it even when I want to, even though there's `content_length` method on `Response` - but that seems to do nothing. Can you please explain it?\r\n\r\nThanks!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/comments/623576596/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jendakol","id":1770097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzAwOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1770097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jendakol","html_url":"https://github.com/jendakol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jendakol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jendakol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jendakol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jendakol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jendakol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jendakol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jendakol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jendakol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jendakol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3300756965,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzMwMDc1Njk2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/events/3300756965","actor":{"login":"omid","id":45714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid","html_url":"https://github.com/omid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-04T16:45:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3300756969,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzMDA3NTY5Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/events/3300756969","actor":{"login":"omid","id":45714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid","html_url":"https://github.com/omid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/omid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-04T16:45:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3300756981,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzMwMDc1Njk4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/events/3300756981","actor":{"login":"robjtede","id":3316789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTY3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3316789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede","html_url":"https://github.com/robjtede","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-04T16:45:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3300756985,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzMDA3NTY5ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/events/3300756985","actor":{"login":"robjtede","id":3316789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTY3ODk=","avatar_url":"h
