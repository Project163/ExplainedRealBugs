That desktop program used `futures` + `tokio` crates, similar to this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nextern crate futures;\r\nextern crate tokio;\r\n\r\nuse futures::{future, Future};\r\nuse tokio::runtime::Runtime;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    loop {\r\n        poll_stats();\r\n        thread::sleep(...);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn poll_stats() {\r\n    let mut runtime = Runtime::new().unwrap();\r\n    runtime.block_on(...).unwrap();\r\n    runtime.shutdown_now().wait().unwrap();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know that was not good use of those crates. But personally I think that pattern was still valid use:\r\n\r\n1. Make new runtime.\r\n2. Block on one single job.\r\n3. Shutdown.\r\n4. Repeat from 1.\r\n\r\nHowever after running for several days, I noticed that the program started to eat RAM, then it couldn't spawn new job anymore. Running `lsof -p <pid>` revealed that there were hundreds of unclosed `ESTABLISHED` TCP connections to my server. I tried some more times, and it happened again and again.\r\n\r\nThen I switched to `futures::future::loop_fn()`. Now the program is running on my desktop. It's polling the server right now with no unclosed connections.\r\n\r\nAgain, I'm really not sure if this can help. I can't prove anything from that experience.  :-(  But in my thinking, I _guess_ there might be some bug in the `futures` crate.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/comments/422240453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1852169353,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4NTIxNjkzNTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/events/1852169353","actor":{"login":"sapir","id":896766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/896766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir","html_url":"https://github.com/sapir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3eb67344fd37c5432b2bd22d993916482fd2e770","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sapir/actix-web/commits/3eb67344fd37c5432b2bd22d993916482fd2e770","created_at":"2018-09-18T11:57:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sapir","id":896766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Njc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/896766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir","html_url":"https://github.com/sapir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sapir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-18T12:01:49Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T12:01:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/514","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/514/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/514/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/514/events","html_url":"https://github.com/actix/actix-web/pull/514","id":361270168,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjE2MjgyNDYx","number":514,"title":"Try
