[This](https://github.com/john01dav/actix-plus) worked fine with in `actix_web` 3.0.0. I [ported the package](https://github.com/finnbear/actix-plus) to support 4.0.0-beta.#, but it stopped matching paths. I narrowed the reason down to this issue.\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n\r\n\r\n* Rust Version (I.e, output of `rustc -V`): `rustc 1.56.0-nightly (ae90dcf02 2021-08-09)`\r\n* Actix Web Version: 4.0.0-beta.9\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"robjtede","id":3316789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTY3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3316789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede","html_url":"https://github.com/robjtede","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/2389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/2389/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
