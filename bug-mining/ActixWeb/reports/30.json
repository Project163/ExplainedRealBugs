Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen using the `on_connect` hook to assign a value into `conn_data`'s `Extensions, the values should be dropped after the connection is closed.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nThe values are indeed visible to the request, but do not get dropped after the connection has closed. This feels like a memory leak.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\n\r\n#### Complete code\r\nRun the code in https://github.com/Schniz/actix-web-not-dropping-on-connect-extensions\r\nand run a `curl http://localhost:8081/`\r\n\r\n#### tl;dr\r\n\r\n* Create a `Droppable` struct, with a `impl Drop` that logs to stdout\r\n* Assign a `Droppable` to the connection:\r\n  ```rust\r\n  HttpServer::new(|| /* .. */)\r\n    .on_connect(|_conn, storage| {\r\n      storage.insert(Droppable);\r\n    })\r\n    .bind(/* ... */)\r\n    .run.await?;\r\n  ```\r\n* Expect to see a line in stdout\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nCaching/connection-aware information did not get dropped\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Rust Version (I.e, output of `rustc -V`): `rustc 1.60.0 (7737e0b5c 2022-04-04)`\r\n- Actix Web Version: `4.0.1`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"robjtede","id":3316789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTY3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3316789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede","html_url":"https://github.com/robjtede","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/2740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/2740/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
