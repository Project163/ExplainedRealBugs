Include code to reproduce, if relevant -->\r\n1. Build and start the server\r\n2. Benchmark the root endpoint where no path information is extracted\r\n3. Benchmark the ID endpoint where path information is extracted\r\n4. Compare the results\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nI noticed the issue while developing a search backend.\r\nAs soon as I extract path or query information, the throughput drops continuously during benchmarking.\r\nIn addition, regardless of whether I extract information, I noticed that the memory consumption is continuously increasing, which could indicate a memory leak.\r\n\r\n## Your

-->\r\nA change made in PR #1486 to support multiple layers of application data caused a leak of app data for each request object that was reclaimed by the request pool. This PR makes a simple change to set fresh app data for a re-used request object rather than appending to the existing vec of app data layers.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds some documentation around the request pool so readers can better understand its purpose and life cycle.\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR fixes or closes an issue, reference it here. -->\r\nfixes #1606\r\nfixes #1607\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/1609/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/1609/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3560524785,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM1NjA1MjQ3ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/events/3560524785","actor":{"login":"robjtede","id":3316789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTY3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3316789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede","html_url":"https://github.com/robjtede","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9b71f55ace09b54a0f36a0c10627986c69ee64bc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/commits/9b71f55ace09b54a0f36a0c10627986c69ee64bc","created_at":"2020-07-18T03:47:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3561238444,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzU2MTIzODQ0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/events/3561238444","actor":{"login":"robjtede","id":3316789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTY3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3316789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede","html_url":"https://github.com/robjtede","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-18T15:17:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3561238520,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM1NjEyMzg1MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/events/3561238520","actor":{"login":"robjtede","id":3316789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTY3ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3316789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede","html_url":"https://github.com/robjtede","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robjtede/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"971ba3eee14b4191ccddd6ddae0a5c135ae789e9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/commits/971ba3eee14b4191ccddd6ddae0a5c135ae789e9","created_at":"2020-07-18T15:17:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
