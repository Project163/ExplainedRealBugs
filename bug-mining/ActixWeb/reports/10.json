Even when running the websocket example, the StreamHandler's finished() method doesn't ever get called. That is, if I add a finished() method to examples/websocket/src/main.rs, similar to the client one, and run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd examples/websocket\r\ncargo run --bin server\r\n```\r\n\r\nand also\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd examples/websocket\r\ncargo run --bin client\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then hit CTRL-C on the client, then the server doesn't notice. Whereas if I hit CTRL-C on the server, the client does get a \"Server disconnected\" message within a few seconds, meaning finished() was called.\r\n\r\n(Also, I noticed that the server is using WebsocketContext, while the client is using a regular Context. Shouldn't the client also use WebsocketContext?)\r\n\r\nnetstat shows that the client closes its half of the socket for writing / sends a FIN (FIN_WAIT2 state) while the server is keeping its half open (CLOSE_WAIT state).\r\n\r\nThis also happens with current actix-web/master / 0.7.8 and actix 0.7.0. I also tried actix master, but then the example doesn't compile anymore.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fafhrd91","id":598990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODk5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/598990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91","html_url":"https://github.com/fafhrd91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/511/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
