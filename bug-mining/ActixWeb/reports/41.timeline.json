behavior. -->\r\n<!-- Emphasize any breaking changes. -->\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of `actix_web::response::builder::HttpResponseBuilder::streaming()`. \r\n\r\nBefore this PR, if `Content-Type` is not set by the user, then there is no such header in the final response. This PR adds a default `Content-Type` of `application/octet-stream`, just like `actix_web::response::builder::HttpResponseBuilder::json()` defaults the `Content-Type` to `application/json`.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, if the user does not call `actix_web::response::builder::HttpResponseBuilder::no_chunking()` but sets `Content-Length`, then the header is silently dropped, as described in #2306. This PR respects the user's input: if the user sets `Content-Length`, then `actix_web::response::builder::HttpResponseBuilder::no_chunking()` is automatically called with the corresponding stream length.\r\n\r\nA small illustration program for the change: \r\n```rust\r\nuse std::{\r\n    pin::Pin,\r\n    task::{Context, Poll},\r\n};\r\n\r\nuse actix_web::{get, web, App, HttpRequest,
