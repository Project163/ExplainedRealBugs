Even when caught in testing, it can take a while to notice the source of the problem.\r\n\r\nRust's \"omit a semicolon to return the value\" rule would be intolerable for programmers - when I explain it to people, they always look skeptical - except that the type checker always catches the mistake. By permitting `()` as a return type, Actix has removed that safety net.\r\n\r\nWithout that impl, people would have to return `HttpResponse::Ok()`, which doesn't seem like much of a burden. All the examples in the documentation do this already.","closed_by":{"login":"fafhrd91","id":598990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODk5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/598990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91","html_url":"https://github.com/fafhrd91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fafhrd91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/1108/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/1108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
