This results in the server returning `400 Bad Request`.\r\n\r\nWhat I think is happening is that `httpie` sends header `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate` (note title-case) and this is not recognized by actix when inserted into `HeaderMap`. Then actix adds it's own similar header in lowercase. I don't really understand how `HeaderMap` handles deduplication but something must have gone wrong.","closed_by":{"login":"DoumanAsh","id":5676053,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzYwNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5676053?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh","html_url":"https://github.com/DoumanAsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DoumanAsh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actix/actix-web/issues/320/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
