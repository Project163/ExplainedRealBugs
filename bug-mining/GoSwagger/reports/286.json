Problem statement\r\n\r\nGenerated client library fails to build due to missing models that aren't generated.\r\n\r\nThere's a `models` modules referenced in one of the generated files (`client/webhooks/webhooks_create_responses.go`), but it's not generated, therefore not available.\r\n\r\nNo matter what combination of command line flags I use I'm not able to generate the missing models. The spec validates successfully using `swagger validate ...` but not sure if there's perhaps something odd about it.\r\n\r\nAny help or pointers would be greatly appreciated, thanks.\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n\r\nhttps://api.cloudsmith.io/?format=openapi\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate the following files:\r\n\r\n`go.mod`\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule github.com/cloudsmith-io/cloudsmith-go\r\n\r\ngo 1.14\r\n```\r\n\r\n`main.go`\r\n\r\n```go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport \"github.com/cloudsmith-io/cloudsmith-go/client\"\r\n\r\nfunc main {\r\n\tclient.New(nil, nil)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -o swagger.json \"https://api.cloudsmith.io/?format=openapi\"\r\nswagger generate client -f swagger.json\r\ngo build\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults in the output:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo: finding module for package github.com/go-openapi/strfmt\r\ngo: finding module for package github.com/go-openapi/runtime\r\ngo: finding module for package github.com/go-openapi/swag\r\ngo: finding module for package github.com/go-openapi/runtime/client\r\ngo: finding module for package github.com/go-openapi/errors\r\ngo: finding module for package github.com/cloudsmith-io/cloudsmith-go/models\r\ngo: finding module for package github.com/go-openapi/validate\r\ngo: found github.com/go-openapi/runtime in github.com/go-openapi/runtime v0.19.15\r\ngo: found github.com/go-openapi/strfmt in github.com/go-openapi/strfmt v0.19.5\r\ngo: found github.com/go-openapi/errors in github.com/go-openapi/errors v0.19.4\r\ngo: found github.com/go-openapi/swag in github.com/go-openapi/swag v0.19.9\r\ngo: found github.com/go-openapi/validate in github.com/go-openapi/validate v0.19.8\r\ngo: finding module for package github.com/cloudsmith-io/cloudsmith-go/models\r\nclient/webhooks/webhooks_create_responses.go:19:2: cannot find module providing package github.com/cloudsmith-io/cloudsmith-go/models: module github.com/cloudsmith-io/cloudsmith-go/models: git ls-remote -q origin in /Users/paddy/go/pkg/mod/cache/vcs/b2f1ca9505e5604c8ac0e6d8cf2590175ec860c989e60b0f5ea99e975f9207be: exit status 128:\r\n\tfatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled\r\nConfirm the import path was entered correctly.\r\nIf this is a private repository, see https://golang.org/doc/faq#git_https for additional information.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: v0.23.0\r\nswagger commit: 3596b40bedd4f06cc918767098568456d2ec2370\r\nswagger container: quay.io/goswagger/swagger:v0.23.0\r\ngo version: go version go1.14.3 darwin/amd64\r\nOS:  OSX 10.13.6\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2306/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
