Run swagger generate\r\n`swagger generate server -f ./swagger.yaml -t ./generated --exclude-main`\r\n2. Go to `generated/restapi/configure*.go`\r\nThere I have comment\r\n```\r\n//go:generate swagger generate server --target ../generated --name ExampleSwaggerServer --spec ../swagger.yaml --exclude-main\r\n```\r\nWhich is not right, because `swagger.yaml` and `generated` directory are 2 levels up, but not one.\r\nIf you try to run go generate you will get an error `couldn't find a swagger spec`\r\nSo comment should be\r\n```\r\n//go:generate swagger generate server --target ../../generated --name ExampleSwaggerServer --spec ../../swagger.yaml --exclude-main\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: v0.17.2\r\ncommit: 800a3052f0305ab54980f961bd4f1e8b3e5599fe\r\ngo version: 1.10.3\r\nOS:   Ubuntu\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1789/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1789/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
