For example, for the following type definition:\n\n``` yaml\ndefinitions:\n  slp_action_enum:\n    type: string\n    enum:\n      - slp.action.STOP\n...\n```\n\nthe following code is generated in `models/slp_action_enum.go`:\n\n``` go\ntype SlpActionEnum string\n...\nfunc (m SlpActionEnum) validateSlpActionEnumEnum(path, location string, value slp_action_enum) error {\n    if slpActionEnumEnum == nil {\n        var res []slp_action_enum\n...\n```\n\nIn the `validateSlpActionEnumEnum` function above, the argument `value` and the variable `res` are of type `slp_action_enum`, which is incorrect since there is no such type.
