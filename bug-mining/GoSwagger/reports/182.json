Create a client with default `basePath`, `host`, `schemes` and `httpTransport`;\r\n2. Create a client with a custom `httpTransport`, hardcoding the `basePath`, `host` and `schemes`;\r\n\r\nIdeally it should _also_ be possible to:\r\n\r\n- Create a client with all defaults, except 1 customized one (e.g. a custom `host`, as is often required for public API's);\r\n- Create a client with a custom `httpTransport`, without having to hardcode the `basePath`, `host` and `schemes`;\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/838/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
