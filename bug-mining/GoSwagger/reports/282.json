This produces some incorrect/different strings and identifier names.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/generator/shared.go#L762\r\n\r\nThe code where this is implemented ☝️ warns that the name shouldn’t be `api` or `test` (in a comment) but it’s not mentioned anywhere in the documentation or treated as an error.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nTry to generate a server from whatever spec using `--name api` and `--name somethingelse`. Observe the difference in the filenames and the identifiers/strings in the code.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\ngo-swagger version: latest master (c1166eb277856e9f1e0ea50d989b12df78e02b18)\r\nOS: macOS Mojave\r\n\r\n## Feedback from Slack (goswagger.slack.com)\r\n\r\n@fredbi pointed out that an improvement could be made which would make sure that the expression never returns an empty string.\r\n\r\nThe `test` suffix is removed in the implementation because of the special meaning of files ending with it in Go.\r\n\r\n`api` suffix is also trimmed to avoid package name conflicts in the generated code - `api` is used in many places.\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution was to return `defaultName` in case that the expression produces an empty string.","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2293/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
