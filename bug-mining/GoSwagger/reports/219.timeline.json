What I was hopping for is to discuss and hopefully to find a better solution to fix this issue. At this moment, the way I see this is 0.14.0 introduced breaking changes to the code that was developed for 0.13.0. Let me explain what I mean:\r\n\r\n0.13.0 was generating models matching definitions from provided swagger specification file(providing there is no external $ref in it). That match also covered model names(So it was relatively easy to find generated model by its name from the swagger). In that version the --skip-flatten was quite handy for exactly that purpose. Those models were used by developers to receive and return data in all endpoints' implementation.\r\n\r\n0.14.0 changed the behaviour of that option to \"expand all\". Thus now both structures content and their names don't match the code that was developed for the previous version. Thus the code that has been developed for 0.13.0 needs to be fixed and there is no guarantee that the next go-swagger version would continue to produce reliable structure content and names.\r\n\r\nI can see a point in doing that for external $ref but would also think that \"flatten light\" solution is a much better option. The way I see it is external definitions' $ref can be imported into models in a similar way the old --skip-flatten option generated internal models(the names of imported models can be mangled to avoid clashes with internal ones).

Description**\r\n\r\nFor a HTTP request, if the method is POST, they may be a request body in it. Then pouch daemon side needs to validate these parameter. This issue is to track all the validation rules for this request  body. In the issue, I only tracked fields which are in type of `string`, `[]string`, `map[string]interface{}`.\r\n\r\nWe should make this validation rules clear, and add these restrictions in swagger.yml. After that, we generate struct codes and user generated validation funcs in APIxxx_bridge.go.\r\n\r\n- [ ] ContainerCreateConfig\r\n  - [ ] ContainerConfig\r\n  - [ ] HostConfig\r\n  - [ ]

NetworkCreateConfig\r\n\r\n@rudyfly Please check the VolumeCreateConfig and NetworkCreateConfig;\r\n@YaoZengzeng Please check whether CRI implementation side needs more restrictions;\r\n@CodeJuan Please master this part, as in the future you will maintain all the API side of Pouch.\r\n@sunyuan3 @Letty5411 Please get these validation aware and we will use these rules to test Pouch Daemon in the

Fixes #1559 (broken codegen with --skip-flatten`\r\n* Refactors model.go and operation.go: reduce code repetition and boiler plate with validations\r\n* Enables model validation codegen on extra schemas in operations\r\n* Body parameters and responses work with full expand (--skip-flatten)\r\n* Models now supports producing extra schema with references to another package (`type.go`, change\r\nto `typeresolver`)\r\n\r\n> This is currently validated by UT only: since the current spec pre-processing \r\n> only leaves the choice between full flattening (no extra schemas possible) or\r\n> full expansion (everything is an anonymous extra schema), there is no CLI\r\n> generation option as for current which leaves complex anonymous structures\r\n> with inner references to model definitions.\r\n> This is thus a preliminary work to support more nuanced spec pre-processing scenarios.\r\n\r\n* fixes enum slice validation for params\r\n\r\n> **NOTE**: I tried to minimize conflicts with PR #1566, but they are unavoidable.\r\n> Please merge in any order, I'll take care of the

Problem statement\r\n\r\nHere are some points that I am considering faulty with `go-openapi/analysis/flatten.go`.\r\n\r\n1. Too many anonymous OAIGen definitions generated. \r\n> OAIGen are generated whenever there is a name conflict when flattening the spec. \r\n> In some obvious cases, however, this conflict may be resolved without creating an additional definition.\r\n> Flatten should issue a warning to the user to explain this \"OAIGen\" creation.\r\n\r\n2.  Have an option to stop flattening as soon as references are good enough for the generator \r\n> At this stage it is not required for codegen to create all $ref's for complex things \r\n> (this is _minimal flattening_ ).\r\n> All codegen will assume that this step has been completed, code checking for remote $ref\r\n> (e.g. `!ref.HasFragmentsOnly`) may be removed\r\n\r\n3.  Full flattening should consider maps of simple things as simple things (e.g. don't create a definition for map[]{my object}, the definition for {myobject} should be enough)\r\n\r\n4. Have an option to remove unused definitions (e.g. `#/parameters` which are expanded), so as to produce a pristine spec.\r\n\r\nI propose the following modification to `swagger` CLI options:\r\n- `--with-flatten=minimal` (default)\r\n- `--with-flatten=full` (correspond to current default)\r\n- `--with-expand` | `--with-flatten=expand` (corresponds to current `--skip-flatten`)\r\n- `--skip-flatten` is desupported\r\n\r\n`--with-flatten` may support multiple options, e.g:\r\n`--with-flatten:full,verbose,remove-unused`\r\n\r\nSome more suggestions to come later on:\r\n5. In full flatten mode, more options to control how allOf are handled\r\n6. In full flatten mode propagating x-go-name (as prefix) to newly created definitions: creating new definitions introduces some naming conventions. If a x-go-name has been set in the original structure, new names are no consistent with their container...\r\n> Example: if an array of complex items has `x-go-name: zzz`, the items definition created should have `x-go-name: zzzItems`\r\n \r\nSee also #1559 \r\n\r\nPoints (1), (2) and (3) and (4) are currently under testing on my dev.\r\nI'll do my best to issue a \"how-to flatten a spec\" doc with this series of PR's.\r\n\r\nPoints (5) and (6) would require some preparatory work on models.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: 0.14\r\ngo version: x.x.x  \r\nOS:
