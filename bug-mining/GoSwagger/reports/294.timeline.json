Problem statement\r\ni'm trying to extract a model from our swagger document & consume it from an external source. we want the the type to be generated by DB access layer which also has a schema & generates code.\r\n\r\nwhen doing so i've hit 2 issues:\r\n1. The API's which use the imported types changed so that they take a value rather than a pointer. this implies most of the called API's which forces a huge change to the code base.\r\nNotet hat the type definition has changed a bit - its the exact same definition when comparing the generated go code using diff tool.\r\nThat's the simple one :)\r\n\r\n2. some API's which take a type T imported using the x-go-type now generate invalid code for the client.\r\nthese API's consume the imported type within the API body. they generate the type as value rather than pointer but still check for it to be nil, which fails to compile.\r\nso having a workaround to make the value back into a pointer would be a work-around.\r\n \r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\nthe part which imports the type looks like so:\r\n```\r\nHotspot:\r\n  x-go-type:\r\n    import:\r\n      package: fbc/xwf/swagger/gen/ents\r\n    type: Hotspot\r\n  x-nullable: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe API declaration (schema version 2.0) is:\r\n```\r\npost:\r\n  tags:\r\n  - hotspot\r\n  summary: Create a Hotspot\r\n  operationId: \"CreateHotspot\"\r\n  consumes:\r\n  - application/json\r\n  produces:\r\n  - application/json\r\n  parameters:\r\n  - in: body\r\n    name: Hotspot\r\n    required: false\r\n    schema:\r\n      $ref: '#/definitions/Hotspot'\r\n  responses:\r\n    201:\r\n      description: Hotspot created.\r\n      schema:\r\n        $ref: '#/definitions/Hotspot'\r\n    400:\r\n      description: Bad request.\r\n      schema:\r\n        $ref: '#/definitions/Error'\r\n    422:\r\n      description: Unprocessable entity\r\n      schema:\r\n        $ref: '#/definitions/Error'\r\n    500:\r\n      description: Unexpected error.\r\n      schema:\r\n        $ref: '#/definitions/Error'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\ngenerating client code generates the following invalid code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc (o *CreateHotspotParams) WriteToRequest(r runtime.ClientRequest, reg strfmt.Registry) error {\r\n\r\n        if err := r.SetTimeout(o.timeout); err != nil {\r\n                return err\r\n        }\r\n        var res []error\r\n\r\n        if o.Hotspot != nil {                   <<<<<<<<<<<<<<< This fails to compile. o.Hotspot is a value, NOT a pointer\r\n                if err := r.SetBodyParam(o.Hotspot); err != nil {\r\n                        return err\r\n                }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if len(res) > 0 {\r\n                return errors.CompositeValidationError(res...)\r\n        }\r\n        return nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: v0.21.0\r\ncommit:

suggesting that the addition of this causes the generated code to have the type map[string]interface{})\r\nhttps://goswagger.io/faq/faq_model.html (Also says that if I add additionalProperties: true it will generate a map[string]interface{})\r\n\r\nIn addition, the following tickets all suggest this is a valid method of achieving the desired result:\r\nhttps://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1450#issuecomment-385613822 (not stated outright but that is how I understood this comment)\r\nhttps://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2081#issuecomment-541296380\r\n\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n```\r\nswagger: \"2.0\"\r\ninfo:\r\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\r\n  title: \"Swagger Petstore\"\r\nhost: \"petstore.swagger.io\"\r\nbasePath: \"/v2\"\r\npaths:\r\n  /pet:\r\n    post:\r\n      operationId: \"addPet\"\r\n      parameters:\r\n      - in: \"body\"\r\n        name: \"body\"\r\n        schema:\r\n          $ref: \"#/definitions/Pet\"\r\n      responses:\r\n        \"405\":\r\n          description: \"Invalid input\"\r\ndefinitions:\r\n  Pet:\r\n    type: \"object\"\r\n    additionalProperties: true\r\n```\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n```\r\n$ go-swagger generate client -t <outputDir> -f <aboveSnippet>\r\n$ cat <outputDir>/models/pet.go\r\n// Code generated by go-swagger; DO NOT EDIT.\r\n\r\npackage models\r\n\r\n// This file was generated by the swagger tool.\r\n// Editing this file might prove futile when you re-run the swagger generate command\r\n\r\n// Pet pet\r\n// swagger:model Pet\r\ntype Pet interface{}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expect that since the Pet definition has `additionalProperties: true`, that the resulting model would be `type Pet map[string]interface{}`, not `type Pet interface{}`\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: 0.22.0  \r\ngo version: 1.13.1  \r\nOS:  MacOS High
