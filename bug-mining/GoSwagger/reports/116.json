Is this intended? I was trying to use Markdown to document the API metadata, as the Swagger UI is able to render markdown.\n\nSo, my code looks like that:\n\n``` go\n// #video-transcoding-api\n//\n// HTTP API for transcoding media files into different formats using pluggable\n// providers.\n//\n// ##Currently supported providers\n//\n// * [Amazon Elastic Transcoder](https://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/)\n// * [Elemental Conductor](https://www.elementaltechnologies.com/products/elemental-conductor)\n// * [Encoding.com](http://api.encoding.com)\n//\n// [...]\n//\n// swagger:meta\npackage main\n```\n\nAnd the result is the following:\n\n``` json\n{\n  [...]\n  \"info\": {\n    \"description\": \"HTTP API for transcoding media files into different formats using pluggable\\nproviders.\\n\\nCurrently supported providers\\n\\nAmazon Elastic Transcoder](https://aws.amazon.com/elastictranscoder/)\\nElemental Conductor](https://www.elementaltechnologies.com/products/elemental-conductor)\\nEncoding.com](http://api.encoding.com)\",\n    [...]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd here is how it's displayed on Swagger UI:\n\n<img width=\"971\" alt=\"swagger-ui-markdown\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/108725/13016371/7d20eb40-d1a5-11e5-9968-4ac5c8a11b29.png\">\n\nI can work on a pull request if this is not intended behavior.\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/276/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
