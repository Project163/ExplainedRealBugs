Where the `MyBase` might reside in another package not directly related to api package.\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// MyBase holds the base attributes\r\ntype MyBase struct {\r\n    AttributeA string `json:\"attributeA\"`\r\n    AttributeB string `json:\"attributeB\"`\r\n}\r\n\r\n// MyBaseResponse used as api response\r\n// swagger:model MyBaseResponse \r\ntype MyBaseResponse struct {\r\n    *MyBase\r\n    AttributeC string `json:\"attributeC\"`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow when running the following command we do see inconsistent results in the generate json.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nswagger generate spec -m -o docs/swagger.json && git diff\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne time it contains the MyBase and the other time we see it is getting removed again. We have this for a bunch of definitions. So one run it removes MyBaseA next time it adds it and removes another one etc. To me this looks like a bug which is not properly traversing composed structs to include those attributes as part of the MyBaseResponse. The behavior is also random as sometimes nothing changes.\r\n\r\nusing above bash command using `git diff` it is easy to detect the changes. For us this is really a blocking issue as `goreleaser` project does not allow dirty state to make a release, which is pretty logical as your release might be jeopardized when generated code changed during a build compared to the committed code.
