few comments on that issue.\r\n\r\n1. It is futile to override the Content-Type header this way: it is overridden by the client runtime based on the \"consumes\" mime types\r\n2. Everything works just fine if the operation declares only one \"consumes\": \"multipart/form-data\" (see a working example: https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/tree/master/examples/file-server)\r\n3. The problem comes from the two \"consumes\" types specified:\r\n   * problem N°1: the order of the mime types for the client is reversed. So it picks primarily \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", which was not intended\r\n   * problem N°2: although the swagger 2.0 states that files _may_ be transferred over \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" ([reference](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md#parameter-object)), our client runtime (go-openapi/runtime/client) does not support that (because it is not the _preferred_ way) and results in a mismatch: sending a multipart body with Content-Type: \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"\r\n\r\nIt is possible to work around this problem by forcing the MIME type in the operation by using an option.\r\nLike so:\r\n```go\r\ndummyAuth := runtime.ClientAuthInfoWriterFunc(func(_ runtime.ClientRequest, _ strfmt.Registry) error {\r\n\t\treturn nil\r\n\t})\r\nforceMime := func(mime string) my_tag.ClientOption {\r\n\t\treturn func(r *runtime.ClientOperation) {\r\n\t\t\tr.ConsumesMediaTypes = []string{mime}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nconst content = \"content of this file\"\r\nrdr := strings.NewReader(content)\r\nparams := my_tag.NewOperationNameParams().\r\n\t\t\t\tWithFile(runtime.NamedReader(\"file\", rdr))\r\nresp, err := c.MyTag.OperationName(params, dummyAuth, forceMime(\"multipart/form-data\"))\r\n````\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/1871512273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/1871513953","html_url":"https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2773#issuecomment-1871513953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2773","id":1871513953,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAZfQX85vjQlh","user":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-28T21:56:48Z","updated_at":"2023-12-28T21:59:26Z","body":"There are a few ways we could improve this situation:\r\n* generate a `UseMIME(...)` option with the client, so that the caller may switch easily when several mimes are consumed\r\n* generate the client with mime types in the specified order\r\n* support application/x-www-form-urlencoded for files in runtime (this would be workable only for small files, and we'd lose the ability to stream).
