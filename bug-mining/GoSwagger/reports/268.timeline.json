in `/cmd/rules_import.go` `models.RawMessage` is [used](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/master/cmd/rules_import.go#L100)  Because `models.RawMessage` is basically `[]uint8` it is converted to base64 when encoded as json as per [documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Marshal)\r\n\r\n>Array and slice values encode as JSON arrays, except that []byte encodes as a base64-encoded string, and a nil slice encodes as the null JSON value.\r\n\r\nIt seems that commit https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/commit/38c52a3cc3a24b1d77d7f07d012be561d018b5ec introduced the problem because it replaced `json.RawMessage` with `models.RawMessage`. When I replaced it back the problem was gone.\r\n\r\nIf needed I can create a pr to fix this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ory/oathkeeper/issues/182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ory/oathkeeper/issues/182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/553361431","html_url":"https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1622#issuecomment-553361431","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1622","id":553361431,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzM2MTQzMQ==","user":{"login":"aeneasr","id":3372410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzI0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3372410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeneasr","html_url":"https://github.com/aeneasr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeneasr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeneasr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeneasr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeneasr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeneasr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeneasr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeneasr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeneasr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aeneasr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T11:25:49Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T11:25:49Z","body":"I've

this patch, `encoding/json.RawMessage` would be interpreted as []uint8, which `encoding/json` is incapable of decoding. This patch addresses that by checking if a type's name is `encoding/json.RawMessage` and if so, sets `type: object`.\r\n\r\nIn #1622 it was suggested to use `type: string` with `format: binary` which is however not the correct use, because this is not an serialized JSON object but a deserialized JSON object.\r\n\r\nIf my understanding is correct, `type: string` with `fromat: binary` would expect something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \"foo\": \"[\\\"bar\\\"]\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype f struct { Foo json.RawMessage `json:\"foo\"` }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas `json.RawMessage` actually implies:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ \"foo\": [\"bar\"] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tried to mess around with `x-go-type`\r\n\r\n```go\r\n\t\t\ttgt.AddExtension(\"x-go-type\", map[string]interface{}{\r\n\t\t\t\t\"import\": map[string]interface{}{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"alias\":   \"json\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"package\": \"encoding/json\",\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\t\"type\": \"RawMessage\",\r\n\t\t\t})\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut that yielded no result when generating the client code but I believe it to be the right extension here, it does seem however that its applicability is limited as discussed in: https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1879#issuecomment-462347371\r\n\r\nI do understand that `json.RawMessage` can be any defined JSON type, and that this is just a workaround for now, but it's better than what we have so far.
