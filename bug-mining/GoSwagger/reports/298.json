For example,\r\n\r\n```\r\nSignupRequest:\r\n    properties:\r\n      email:\r\n        type: string\r\n    required:\r\n      - email\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill be\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype SignupRequest struct {\r\n\t// email\r\n\t// Required: true\r\n\tEmail *string `json:\"email\"`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, required properties of an object that are referenced to definitions  are not pointers by default. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSignupRequest:\r\n    properties:\r\n      email:\r\n        $ref: \"#/definitions/Email\"\r\n    required:\r\n      - email\r\ndefinitions:\r\n  Email:\r\n    type: string\r\n```\r\nwille be:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype SignupRequest struct {\r\n\t// email\r\n\t// Required: true\r\n\tEmail Email `json:\"email\"`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould Email field be of *Email type?\r\n\r\nNow to get the email as pointer, we can use `x-nullable`. However the following does not work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSignupRequest:\r\n    properties:\r\n      email:\r\n        $ref: \"#/definitions/Email\"\r\n        x-nullable: true\r\n    required:\r\n      - email\r\ndefinitions:\r\n  Email:\r\n    type: string\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut If we put `x-nullable` in the definition as following, it works, but I do not want to do it in the common definitions!\r\n\r\n```\r\nSignupRequest:\r\n    properties:\r\n      email:\r\n        $ref: \"#/definitions/Email\"\r\n    required:\r\n      - email\r\ndefinitions:\r\n  Email:\r\n    type: string\r\n    x-nullable: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other workaround is to use `allOf` as following. Which is weird!\r\n\r\n```\r\nSignupRequest:\r\n    properties:\r\n      email:\r\n        allOf:\r\n          - $ref: \"#/definitions/Email\"\r\n          - x-nullable: true\r\n    required:\r\n      - email\r\ndefinitions:\r\n  Email:\r\n    type: string\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: 2.0\r\ngo version: go1.14.6\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2400/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2400/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
