Currently (latest tip e4c8b3c09d4ed2b35e6b77e57ab77169e56243fc) you will get: \n\n``` shell\n$ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \"http://127.0.0.1:8282/testing\" -d 'names=test'\n{\"code\":500,\"message\":\"request Content-Type isn't multipart/form-data\"}\n$ # obviously this next one doesn't work as well\n$ curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" \"http://127.0.0.1:8282/testing\" -d 'name=test'\n{\"code\":415,\"message\":\"unsupported media type \\\"multipart/form-data\\\", only [application/x-www-form-urlencoded] are allowed\"}\n```\n\nThis appears to be coming from the std lib and more accurately from the call at\n`restapi/operations/post_testing_parameters.go:37`\n\n``` go\n29  func (o *PostTestingParams) BindRequest(r *http.Request, route *middleware.MatchedRoute) error {\n30      var res []error\n31      if err := r.ParseMultipartForm(32 << 20); err != nil {\n32          return err\n33      }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/263/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
