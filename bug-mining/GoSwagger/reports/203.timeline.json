Problem statement\r\n\r\n$ref about string type with format, loading feature is broken.\r\nFor example, define `mydate` in swagger (this is `type=string, format=date`),  and passing correct input (e.g. `2017-01-01`),  on deseriazeation is failed.\r\n\r\nMaybe, generated code defines new type (type alias of strfmt.Date) but UnmarshalText method is not defined. so swag.ReadJSON is failed.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nswagger.yml\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ndefinitions:\r\n  mydate:\r\n    description: this is mydate\r\n    type: string\r\n    format: date\r\n```\r\n\r\ngenerating
