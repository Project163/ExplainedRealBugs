Here `MyType` used in a `Zzz` object type:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Zzz struct {\r\n        // meta\r\n        Meta MyType `json:\"meta,omitempty\"`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it generates bad go code as the \"import.package\" is empty (then gofmt glues field name and the type together):\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype Zzz struct {\r\n        // meta\r\n        Meta.MyType `json:\"meta,omitempty\"`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a way to overcome this behavior?
