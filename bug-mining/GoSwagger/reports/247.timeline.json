Please advise.\r\n\r\n```golang\r\n// WriteResponse to the client\r\nfunc (o *GetAllOK) WriteResponse(rw http.ResponseWriter, producer runtime.Producer) {\r\n\r\n\trw.WriteHeader(200)\r\n\tif o.Payload != nil {\r\n\t\t// FRED\r\n\t\t// .IsArray: true\r\n\t\t// .IsAliased: true\r\n\t\t// .IsMap: false\r\n\t\t// .IsComplexObject: true\r\n\t\t// .IsNullable: false\r\n\t\t// .IsInterface: false\r\n\t\t// .Zero: make(models.B1, 0, 50)\r\n\t\t// .IsBaseType: false\r\n\t\t// From above: Payload POINTER\r\n\t\tpayload := o.Payload\r\n\t\tif payload == nil {\r\n\t\t\tpayload = &models.B1{}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tif err := producer.Produce(rw, payload); err != nil {\r\n\t\t\tpanic(err) // let the recovery middleware deal with this\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n``` ","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/372676048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
