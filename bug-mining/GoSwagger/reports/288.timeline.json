Problem statement\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nsmall introduction:\r\nAs described in #2156, i'm working on generating and testing client library for a swagger specified on:\r\nhttps://vdc-download.vmware.com/vmwb-repository/dcr-public/6faa975e-68ee-4c6c-944a-5e9e664b2475/50c61a14-cc14-4adb-b936-b5411ccdd1a5/swagger-3.3.2-dist.json.\r\nWhich is latest 3.3.2 version from https://code.vmware.com/apis/784/velocloud-sdwan-vco-api\r\n\r\nFixed all items for duplicated definitions, and a few other \"cornercases\" which are addressed in #2161 for follow-up.\r\n\r\nThe swagger version derived from that, with all required fixes are at:\r\n[Manual fixed swagger](https://iafilius.home.xs4all.nl/swagger-3.3.2-dist-manualfixes7.json)\r\n\r\n\r\nClient generated with:\r\n```\r\n../go-swagger/cmd/swagger/swagger generate client -f ./swagger-3.3.2-dist-manualfixes7.json ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like overlap with issue #1707 which is open for more then a year. (but not 100% sure)\r\n\r\nWhile starting with the most simple API call in library (apart from logging in), i need to give the 'EdgeEdgeProvisionBody' struct as API call parameter.\r\n\r\nAs i'm lookin into go-swagger as an option to generate the client library (opposed to maven/swagger UI), with special focus on a few known issues like:\r\n- not submitting 'non defined and optional(omitempty) types' (structs, bool's, int's, strings etc), even when a possible default value is zero (by design)\r\n- submitting 'defined and optional (omitempty) typed' (structs, bool's, int's, strings etc), even when value is zero.\r\n\r\nUsing pointer's to (nested) types (struct, string, bool, int ...) is a good working solution path, and also practiced in go-swagger.\r\nBut it looks like the produced code contains an error.\r\nFor example, the first struct i noticed:\r\n```\r\n/*EdgeEdgeProvisionBody edge_edge_provision\r\nswagger:model EdgeEdgeProvisionBody\r\n*/\r\ntype EdgeEdgeProvisionBody struct {\r\n\r\n\t// challenge password\r\n\tChallengePassword string `json:\"challengePassword,omitempty\"`\r\n\r\n\t// configuration Id\r\n\t// Required: true\r\n\tConfigurationID *int64 `json:\"configurationId\"`\r\n\r\n\t// description\r\n\tDescription string `json:\"description,omitempty\"`\r\n\r\n\t// enterprise Id\r\n\tEnterpriseID int64 `json:\"enterpriseId,omitempty\"`\r\n\r\n\t// generate certificate\r\n\tGenerateCertificate bool `json:\"generateCertificate,omitempty\"`\r\n\r\n\t// ha enabled\r\n\tHaEnabled bool `json:\"haEnabled,omitempty\"`\r\n\r\n\t// model number\r\n\t// Required: true\r\n\t// Enum: [edge500 edge5X0 edge510 edge6X0 edge840 edge1000 edge1000qat edge3X00 virtual]\r\n\tModelNumber *string `json:\"modelNumber\"`\r\n\r\n\t// name\r\n\tName string `json:\"name,omitempty\"`\r\n\r\n\t// private key password\r\n\tPrivateKeyPassword string `json:\"privateKeyPassword,omitempty\"`\r\n\r\n\t// serial number\r\n\tSerialNumber string `json:\"serialNumber,omitempty\"`\r\n\r\n\t// site\r\n\tSite *models.Site `json:\"site,omitempty\"`\r\n\r\n\t// subject c n\r\n\tSubjectCN string `json:\"subjectCN,omitempty\"`\r\n\r\n\t// subject o\r\n\tSubjectO string `json:\"subjectO,omitempty\"`\r\n\r\n\t// subject o u\r\n\tSubjectOU string `json:\"subjectOU,omitempty\"`\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSolution for nested structs looks OK:\r\n```\r\n\t// site\r\n\tSite *models.Site `json:\"site,omitempty\"`\r\n```\r\n\r\nSolution for Mandatory values has the pointer solution, so it will submit the parameter but with null value, like:\r\n'''\r\n\"configurationId\":null,\r\n'''\r\nThis is perfectly fine.\r\n\r\nBut the types which are defined defined as optional (omitempty) are not defined as pointers. A typical sample:\r\n```\r\n\t// ha enabled\r\n\tHaEnabled bool `json:\"haEnabled,omitempty\"`\r\n```\r\nSo in this case, the boolean only wil be submitted when having the true value, and false value is always ignored. (empty/not defined != false)\r\n\r\nThe same with an int:\r\n```\r\n\t// enterprise Id\r\n\tEnterpriseID int64 `json:\"enterpriseId,omitempty\"`\r\n\r\n```\r\nSo a valid value of '0' always will be ignored.\r\nThis last case (omitempty without pointer solution) should be changed to a using a pointer as well.\r\nRemoving the 'omitempty' does not solve it, it introduces the issue that value always is send, even when not defiend (as null, when using pointer).\r\nIn this case the API server is quite unpredictable when submitting parameters is is not expecting, introducing lots of undesired effects.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nArjan\r\n\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n2.0\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSee above description, \r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version:
