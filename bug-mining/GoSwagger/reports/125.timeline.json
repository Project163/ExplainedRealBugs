me, I think not having the server handle both was because of the std libs behaviour of `http.Handle` and whether the path arg is a prefix - I can't recall exactly, but without the slash I think the server would not treat the given path as a prefix so the handler would not get matched for nested routes.\n\nRe why not just catch it:\n\nI guess the server is catching it, and (possibly?) doing the \"right\" thing by doing a 301 to the canonical resource.\n\nRe your test:\n\nCorrect, so here's an example call:\n\n```\n$ curl -D - https://example.com/api/my-op\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\nLocation: /api/my-op/\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nDate: Mon, 15 Feb 2016 01:56:54 GMT\nServer: Google Frontend\nCache-Control: private\nAlt-Svc:
