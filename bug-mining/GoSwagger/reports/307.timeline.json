Git strongly discourages the use of it, even though it is technically possible, with great care and caution. \r\n\r\nFurther, go-swagger is still in its 0.x release series. It might just not be the right time to enter this debate about whether resolving $Version$ tags in source code is a good thing or not.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nFred","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/348439781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/348457751","html_url":"https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1283#issuecomment-348457751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1283","id":348457751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODQ1Nzc1MQ==","user":{"login":"reidrac","id":120189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/120189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidrac","html_url":"https://github.com/reidrac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidrac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidrac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidrac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidrac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidrac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidrac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidrac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidrac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidrac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-01T10:20:49Z","updated_at":"2017-12-01T10:29:09Z","body":"Thanks for your explanation, really appreciated.\r\n\r\nI have a requirement of being able to build from source in a reliable and predictable way, so using \"dep\" helps because I can pin commits on go-swagger dependencies (that are currently floating; so if you build go-swagger 0.12.0 now, you won't get the same binary/features than when it was released).\r\n\r\nI downloaded the binary version of 0.12.0 and the git commit reported doesn't match the commit tagged as 0.12.0; plus the floating dependencies, I can't use it because when we hit an issue we don't really know what's going on.\r\n\r\nFor example, building 0.12.0 recently, out spec didn't work anymore because of this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/go-openapi/spec/commit/5a4a1e94454f878ce1e1fefff23ea10bd5dd5110\r\n\r\nSo we really need to use \"dep\" to pin the version of the dependencies.\r\n\r\nI think is reasonable to expect the version command to behave correctly when building from source, even if there's no git information available.
