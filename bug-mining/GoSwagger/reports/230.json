Problem statement\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is related to #842, but when an endpoint expects an array of polymorphic values, the server fails with the following error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"code\":400,\"message\":\"parsing contents body from \\\"\\\" failed, because json: cannot unmarshal object into Go value of type models.Value\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n\r\n``` yaml\r\nswagger: '2.0'\r\ninfo:\r\n  version: '0.0.1'\r\n  title: Test\r\nschemes:\r\n  - http\r\nbasePath: /v1\r\nproduces:\r\n  - application/json\r\nconsumes:\r\n  -

Implement a dummy handler  \r\n- Build and start the server  \r\n- execute the following curl:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl 'http://localhost:PORT/v1/test -X PUT -H 'Content-type: application/json' -d '[{\"ValueType\":\"StringValue\",\"Foobar\":\"hello\"}]'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: 0.12.0  \r\ngo version: go1.9.1 darwin/amd64  \r\nOS:   MacOS but should be irrelevant\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nWhen `payload` is to be an object that contains the array instead of just the array, it works.\r\n\r\n``` yaml\r\n- name: payload\r\n    in: body\r\n    required: true\r\n    schema:\r\n      type: object\r\n      properties:\r\n        values:\r\n          type: array\r\n          items:\r\n            $ref: '#/definitions/Value'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the issue can be worked around it is not a blocking issue for me, I am submitting this issue more out of curiosity as to what provokes this behavior.\r\n\r\nEdit: fix invalid sample
