me this is still a problem.\r\n\r\nI'm starting out with an empty `$GOPATH` and a the swagger `0.7.4` binary.\r\nFollowing the simple server tutorial I generate the `swagger.yml` with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nswagger init spec \\\r\n  --title \"A To Do list application\" \\\r\n  --description \"The product of a tutorial on goswagger.io\" \\\r\n  --version 1.0.0 \\\r\n  --scheme http \\\r\n  --consumes application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json \\\r\n  --produces application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich finishes with the message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFor this generation to compile you need to have some packages in your GOPATH:\r\n\r\n  * github.com/go-openapi/runtime\r\n  * github.com/tylerb/graceful\r\n  * github.com/jessevdk/go-flags\r\n  * golang.org/x/net/context\r\n```\r\nI `go get -u` those and add a simple hello world get handler that returns a string and 200 to the swagger spec. Then I try to build the server with `go build -v cmd/a-to-do-list-application-server/main.go`.\r\nIt failes on missing packages:\r\n- `github.com/go-openapi/analysis`\r\n- `github.com/go-openapi/loads`\r\n- `github.com/go-openapi/spec`\r\n- `github.com/go-openapi/validate`\r\n- `github.com/gorilla/context`\r\n\r\nAfter installing those I try to compile again and finally get the message this issue is built on:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n[rio@ravage testserver]$ go build -v cmd/a-to-do-list-application-server/main.go
