This scenario makes impossible to properly package go-swagger for GNU/Linux source-based distributions such as Arch, and Gentoo due to missing bundled dependencies.\n\nI am the maintainer of the Gentoo `ebuild` for go-swagger (you can find it [here](https://github.com/Dr-Terrible/go-overlay/tree/master/dev-util/go-swagger)), so I can easily circumvent the issue by manually update the missing dependency. Unfortunately, it will not be so easy to fix for other distributions, so I think it's worth fixing by upstream with an updated tarball (or a new version bump, whatever suits you better).\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
