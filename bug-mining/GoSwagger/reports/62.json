encountered some problems with the Authorization Handler in the configure_api not being called. \nDigging around, I notices that the AuthenticatorsFor method in my api does not return anything.\n\nspec looks like this:\n\n```\n    \"securityDefinitions\": {\n        \"token\": {\n            \"type\": \"apiKey\",\n            \"in\": \"header\",\n            \"name\": \"Authorization\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"security\": [\n        {\n            \"token\": []\n        }\n    ],\n```\n\nThe generated \"AuthenticatorsFor\" method:\n\n```\nfunc (o *someAPI) AuthenticatorsFor(schemes map[string]spec.SecurityScheme) map[string]httpkit.Authenticator {\n\n    result := make(map[string]httpkit.Authenticator)\n    for name, scheme := range schemes {\n        switch name { // <== name here is \"token\"\n\n        case \"Authorization\":\n\n            result[name] = security.APIKeyAuth(scheme.Name, scheme.In, func(tok string) (interface{}, error) { return o.AuthorizationAuth(tok) })\n\n        }\n    }\n    return result\n}\n```\n\nIt checks for the name of the securityShema, which in my case is \"token\".\nChanging the security schema's name to be the same as the header name, fixed the problem.\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/152/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
