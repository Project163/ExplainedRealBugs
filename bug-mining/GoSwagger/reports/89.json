err != nil {\n             return err\n       }\n}\n```\n\nThe `qTestingThis != \"\"` is always true and the whole check can be omitted in this case.\n\nI don't know how to implement this, without breaking backwards compatibility, with previously generated code. \n\nBreaking compatibility proposition:\nIf all the fields that are not required are actually pointers to the values, a pointer of `nil` can mean that they are not set. This will definitely break code that use direct field setting of the param struct:\n\n``` go\n&GetTestingParams{\n     TestingThis: 12, \n}\n```\n\ninstead of the functions. \n\np.s. My workaround (especially because I never actually set the field) is to change it's type to string before generating the code. \n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
