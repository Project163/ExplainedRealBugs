On top of that a server cli application can be created, but one can be manually created as well. Before one can call `server.Serve()` the api needs to be properly configured AND the server has to have the handler set. Currently that process is in my opinion quite error prone.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGenerate a server based on any valid OpenAPI spec and then create a server cli app more or less as follows:\r\n\r\n```go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\n// imports...\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tswaggerSpec, err := loads.Analyzed(restapi.SwaggerJSON, \"\")\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\tlog.Fatalln(err)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tapi := foo.NewFooAPI(swaggerSpec)\r\n\r\n\tserver := restapi.NewServer(api)\r\n\tdefer server.Shutdown()\r\n\r\n\t// calling any route will make the server app panic (and recover)\r\n\t// the reason being that server.ConfigureAPI() isn't called\r\n\t// instead the user choose to set the handler herself,\r\n\t// but forgot to set the producers and consumers among other things.\r\n\r\n\tserver.SetHandler(api.Serve(nil))\r\n\tif err := server.Serve(); err != nil {\r\n\t\tlog.Fatalln(err)\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n\r\nWhen you use the generated server cli instead you'll have it calling `server.ConfigureAPI()`, making it not panic and instead return you the expected NotImplemented errors, when calling any route.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nWhile this work greats, it's not a good solution I think. The generated configureAPI function is pretty useless, which makes sense I suppose, knowing that it seems to be a file that is meant to be edited and thus being made useful.\r\n\r\nPersonally however I think we should rely on better defaults and I think I have a solution that doesn't break any code for people using older versions.\r\n\r\n> Make the API constructor have reasonable defaults.\r\n\r\nFor this we have to change a constructor such as this:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc NewFooAPI(spec *loads.Document) *FooAPI {\r\n\treturn &FooAPI{\r\n\t\thandlers:        make(map[string]map[string]http.Handler),\r\n\t\tformats:         strfmt.Default,\r\n\t\tdefaultConsumes: \"application/json\",\r\n\t\tdefaultProduces: \"application/json\",\r\n\t\tServerShutdown:  func() {},\r\n\t\tspec:            spec,\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc NewFooAPI(spec *loads.Document) * FooAPI {\r\n\treturn & FooAPI{\r\n\t\thandlers:        make(map[string]map[string]http.Handler),\r\n\t\tformats:         strfmt.Default,\r\n\t\tdefaultConsumes: \"application/json\",\r\n\t\tdefaultProduces: \"application/json\",\r\n\t\tServerShutdown:  func() {},\r\n\t\t// basically giving the `ServerError`, `producers`\r\n\t\t// and `consumers` a decent default\r\n\t\tServeError:      errors.ServerError,\r\n\t\tJSONConsumer:    runtime.JSONConsumer(),\r\n\t\tJSONProducer:    runtime.JSONProducer(),\r\n\t\tTxtProducer:     runtime.TextProducer(),\r\n\t\tspec:            spec,\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing this makes it so that the API as it is just works. On top of that we could also make all the handlers by default _NotImplementedHandlers_, such that the simple example given above just works, without any weird unexpected panics.\r\n\r\nAnother idea would be that the `configureAPI` function wouldn't just stupidly override all handlers, and instead first check if the handlers are still nil. And only override a handler if it is indeed still nil.\r\n\r\nLastly, one could even forget to set the handler (e.g. via `server.SetHandler(api.Serve(nil))`) and not get a panic or fatal error at start up to warn about this. Instead no routes will be available and everything will return a `404`. These errors might tip of the user, but perhaps explicitly shouting to the user about this problem at start-up of the cmd app might be more helpful and beginner-friendly?","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/810/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/810/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
