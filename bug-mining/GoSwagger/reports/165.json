For the swagger snippet below I see the following handler being generated in the `configure_whatever.go`:\n\n```\napi.HealthGetHealthHandler = health.GetHealthHandlerFunc(func() middleware.Responder {\n  return middleware.NotImplemented(\"operation health.GetHealth has not yet been implemented\")\n})\n```\n\nThere is no argument in the signature that allows me to access the original HTTP request to, for example, read an HTTP header. \n## Swagger specification\n\n```\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  title: Swagger issue\n  description: foobar\n  version: \"1.0.0\"\nhost: example.com\nschemes:\n  - http\nbasePath: /v1\nconsumes:\n  - application/json\nproduces:\n  - application/json\n\npaths:\n  /health:\n    get:\n      summary: Health check resource\n      description: Checks the health of the API.\n      tags:\n        - Health\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: Service is healty\n          schema:\n            $ref: '#/definitions/Health'\n        503:\n          description: Service not available\n\ndefinitions:\n  Health:\n    type: object\n    properties:\n      status:\n        type: string\n        description: Short status message about the health.\n\n```\n## Steps to reproduce\n1.

Look at the handler and try go access original request. \n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/550/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
