Also, the way contexts in go work causes values to be removed from the context once the handler that setted the value returns. (= the values are not available in the previous handlers. Even after the handler called ServeHTTP on the next handler in the chain.)\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is:\r\nThe logging handler adds a value containing a string-pointer to the context. The authorization handler (that is further down the handler-chain) sets the value of this pointer to a string containing the user for the current request. The logging-handler can then (after calling ServeHTTP) use the string-pointer (that now points to a username) to include the username in the printed logs.\r\n\r\nThis is not really a clean solution,
