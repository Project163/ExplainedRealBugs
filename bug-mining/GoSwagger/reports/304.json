err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn err\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\nWhich, as you can see, typecasts the integer to an int64. This results in failure if Serial is a large enough uint64.\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n```\r\n      parameters:\r\n        - in: path\r\n          name: serial\r\n          type: integer\r\n          format: uint64\r\n          required: true\r\n          description: The serial number\r\n          minimum: 1\r\n```\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nCreate a route with the given path parameter.
