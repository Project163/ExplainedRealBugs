Problem statement\n\nWith the recent change all required values are now pointers. Even though it is a valid and reasonable change from some points of view, it makes life much harder for me, GC and makes code ugly to work with generated models when required property can not be nullable and even zero value by design.\n\nThe similar problem affected not required values, many of them turned to be not nullable. However, I like this, because I have a control via \"x-nullable: true\" to turn them to be nullable when I want to. On the other hand, there is no way to use the same way to turn required properties to be not nullable.\n\nSo, the request is to make \"x-nullable: false\" to work with the required property.\n\nrelated:
