Fix the code causing the runtime exception. My understanding is that should be as simple as adding delete [here](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/httpkit/request.go#L28)\n2. Decide that we don't want to support DELETEs with bodies. Generally you shouldn't be sending bodies with REST APIs, _but_ it isn't forbidden in HTTP1.1 - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.5. If this is the case it should probably fail validation. \n\nHappy to submit a PR but would like to hear thoughts on which approach we want to take here. \n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/219/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
