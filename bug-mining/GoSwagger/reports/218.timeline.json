Problem statement\r\nThe issue is similar to the Issue #1392 and #1093 but not the same.\r\nWhen the body parameter is an under properties in object type, referencing array data type, none of the validation is called. But if we mark the body parameter required, the validation will show in the auto-generated code.\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n**Case : 1**\r\n```yaml\r\nprofileCfg: \r\n           type: object\r\n           properties:\r\n               value1:\r\n                   type: integer\r\n                   format: int32\r\n              value2:\r\n                  type: integer\r\n                  format: int32                    \r\nprofileCfgs:\r\n           type: array\r\n           x-omitempty: true\r\n           items:\r\n              $ref: '#definitions/profileCfg'\r\nProfile:\r\n           type: object\r\n           properties: \r\n                  profileCfg:\r\n                       $ref: '#definitions/profileCfgs'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Case: 2**\r\n```yaml\r\nprofileCfg: \r\n           type: object\r\n           properties:\r\n               value1:\r\n                   type: integer\r\n                   format: int32\r\n              value2:\r\n                  type: integer\r\n                  format: int32                    \r\nprofileCfgs:\r\n           type: array\r\n           x-omitempty: true\r\n           items:\r\n              $ref: '#definitions/profileCfg'\r\nProfile:\r\n           type: object\r\n           required:\r\n               - profileCfg\r\n           properties: \r\n                  profileCfg:\r\n                       $ref: '#definitions/profileCfgs'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Case 3**\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nprofileCfg: \r\n           type: object\r\n           properties:\r\n               value1:\r\n                   type: integer\r\n                   format: int32\r\n              value2:\r\n                  type: integer\r\n                  format: int32            \r\nProfile:\r\n           type: object\r\n           required:\r\n               - profileCfg\r\n           properties: \r\n                  profileCfg:\r\n                       type: array\r\n                       x-omitempty: true\r\n                       items:\r\n                         $ref: '#definitions/profileCfg'\r\n```\r\n                    \r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGenerate the server based on this swagger\r\nIn the Case1, the validation will not be generated.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (m *Profile) Validate(formats strfmt.Registry) error {\r\n        var res []error\r\n        if len(res) > 0 {\r\n                              return errors\r\n        }\r\n         return nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the Case2, the validation will be generated successfully.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (m *profile) Validate(formats strfmt.Registry) error {\r\n      var res []error\r\n      if err := m.validateProfile(formats); err != nil {\r\n                res = append(res, err)\r\n      }\r\n     if len(res) > 0 {\r\n                              return errors\r\n        }\r\n         return nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the Case3, if we remove the refer to the array struct, and without mark the area required the validation will still be generated same as the code in the Case 2. (Case 3 validation generation is by the fix in the issue #1392 and #1093.\r\n\r\nSo I think there may an issue that I have to mark the parameter required which it referring to the array struct if I want the validation to generate.

Problem statement\r\n\r\nFollowing investigations about #1536 (body param is an array), it appeared that the situation \r\nin which body is a map is not rendered properly, and neither is validation carried on.\r\n\r\nSituations such as:\r\n```yaml\r\nparameters:\r\n  - name: mapOfObject\r\n     in: body\r\n     required: true\r\n     schema:\r\n      type: object\r\n      additionalProperties:\r\n        $ref: '#/definitions/modelObject'\r\n```\r\n\r\nare rendered as interface{} param without validation.\r\n\r\nI am proposing a PR to produce a mapping like this:\r\n```go\r\ntype GetMapObjectParams struct {\r\n  ...\r\n  MapOfObject models.GetMapObjectParamBody\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the corresponding validation, calling `body.Validate(route.Formats)`\r\n\r\nThis is for maps of complex objects.\r\n\r\nFor simple maps such as in:\r\n```yaml\r\nparameters:\r\n  - name: mapOfArrayWithMax\r\n     in: body\r\n     required: true\r\n     schema:\r\n      type: object\r\n      additionalProperties:\r\n        $ref: '#/definitions/modelArray'\r\n```\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nparameters:\r\n  - name: mapOfAnonArray\r\n     in: body\r\n     required: true\r\n     schema:\r\n      type: object\r\n      additionalProperties:\r\n        type: array\r\n        maxItems: 10\r\n        items:\r\n          type: integer\r\n          maximum: 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe rendering would respectively look like:\r\n```go\r\n   ...\r\n  MapOfArrayWithMax map[string]models.ModelArrayWithMax\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```go\r\n   ...\r\n  MapOfAnonArray map[string][]int64\r\n```\r\nIn these cases, validation is deferred to a method called by `BindRequest` to take care of nested structures.\r\n\r\nAlso, when using aliased interface{} types, such as in : \r\n```yaml\r\nparameters:\r\n  - name: mapOfInterface\r\n     in: body\r\n     required: true\r\n     schema:\r\n      type: object\r\n      additionalProperties:\r\n        $ref: '#/definitions/modelInterface'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe rendering would not be just `interface{}`, but rather:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n  ...\r\n  MapOfInterface map[string]models.ModelInterface\r\n``` \r\n\r\nOf course in this case, there is no validation.\r\n\r\nSince I discovered other problems when using `--skip-flatten`,  i.e. full support for body validation with anonymous schemas generated in the operation package, I'd rather defer the resolution of \r\nissues specific to having everything anonymous (with possible duplicates) to another PR.\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\nSee example above.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n`generate server ...`\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: 0.14 \r\ngo version: 1.9.1\r\nOS:   ubuntu 14\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1556/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1656933135,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2NTY5MzMxMzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/events/1656933135","actor":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3d053493adbe9f497e15516ff38e71f5f67f8a69","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fredbi/go-swagger/commits/3d053493adbe9f497e15516ff38e71f5f67f8a69","created_at":"2018-05-31T20:41:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-31T20:42:55Z","updated_at":"2018-05-31T20:42:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1566","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1566/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1566/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1566/events","html_url":"https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/pull/1566","id":328289630,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTkxODY4Mjgx","number":1566,"title":"Render

Render and validate maps in body parameters\r\n- fix incorrect rendering of maps in body param (i.e systematic `ìnterface{}` type)\r\n- validate maps (e.g. schema AdditionalProperties) in body parameter\r\n- render simple maps (e.g. `map[string][]map[string][][][]int64`) as inlined types\r\n- maps of schema does not create a schema of their own, just the complex part (e.g. `map[string][][]map[string]model.MyModel`)\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n- fixes #1556 \r\n- fixes #1562\r\n\r\n### Summary of changes\r\n\r\n- `operation.go`:**refactoring + new feature/fix**\r\n  - refactored body param processing\r\n  - treat anonymous maps as Child GenParameter structures (such as `[]map[string][][][]map[string]*model.MyMode`)\r\n  - extended body param validation strategy selection to maps\r\n  - fix: enums are considered slice validations, including for bod params\r\n  \r\n- `model.go`: **targeted fixes**\r\n  - refactored slice validations\r\n  - fix missing lift validation case for maps\r\n  - align nullable status for maps of primitives or arrays of primitives (#1562)\r\n  \r\n- `types.go`: **cosmetic**\r\n  - more comments in code (e.g. special nullability rules)\r\n  - outsource debug func\r\n  \r\n- `structs.go`: **enrichments**\r\n  - removed unused and unassigned `BodyParam` struct\r\n  - enriched GenParameters to support map constructs\r\n  \r\n- `templates/server/parameter.gotmpl`: **refactoring + new feature/fix**\r\n   - extended body param section to support maps as well as maps, with or without validations\r\n   - large refactoring of nested validations to merge slice and map validations\r\n   - follow guards as in models (IsZero | Required)\r\n   \r\n### Known issues\r\n\r\nKnown existing issues not resolved here:\r\n\r\n1. fully supporting `--skip-flatten` (e.g. anonymous types + extra schemas in the operation package)\r\n2. undue definitions created by flatten on maps of objects (non blocking)\r\n3. incorrect validations of Zero Values in slices and maps in some cases (e.g. skipping validation with IsZero())\r\n4. depending on the future solution to replace/remove IsZero|Required for slice and map elements, the nullability re-alignment above \r\nmay be easily modified and change nullable priorities\r\n5. Nice to have: nested array validations with slice validations should execute slice validation before, not after validating all elements","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1566/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1664705624,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2NjQ3MDU2MjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/events/1664705624","actor":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6a08ec72c2a34b45b2cdea325495b63aff6b39de","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fredbi/go-swagger/commits/6a08ec72c2a34b45b2cdea325495b63aff6b39de","created_at":"2018-06-05T20:53:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1679170105,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2NzkxNzAxMDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/events/1679170105","actor":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"85fabfe37f8f00525b1060bbe95e18f8cc057324","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fredbi/go-swagger/commits/85fabfe37f8f00525b1060bbe95e18f8cc057324","created_at":"2018-06-13T16:22:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1679390189,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2NzkzOTAxODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/events/1679390189","actor":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d779b42920e955d465dd15679160045440293178","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fredbi/go-swagger/commits/d779b42920e955d465dd15679160045440293178","created_at":"2018-06-13T18:07:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1684392073,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2ODQzOTIwNzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/events/1684392073","actor":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/
