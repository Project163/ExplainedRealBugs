Problem statement\r\n\r\nJust tested the `quay.io/goswagger/swagger:0.15.0` docker image as a replacement for 0.14.0 for generating a client.\r\n\r\nThe error output was:\r\n\r\n```\r\nname inlined schema: object has no field /v4/users/%7Bemail%7D/\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith 0.14.0. the generation works fine based off the identical spec.\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n\r\nThe spec is in this folder:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/giantswarm/api-spec/tree/14d57a701b20135b174e97a7e755e0b49f28c097\r\n\r\nThe main file is `spec.yaml`, there are three more referenced YAML files in the same folder. The place where the generation broke is likely [line 293 or spec.yaml](https://github.com/giantswarm/api-spec/blob/14d57a701b20135b174e97a7e755e0b49f28c097/spec.yaml#L293):\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `git clone https://github.com/giantswarm/gsclientgen.git`\r\n2. Edit `Makefile` to replace `quay.io/goswagger/swagger:0.15.0` with `quay.io/goswagger/swagger:0.15.0`\r\n3. Run `make generate`\r\n\r\nThis will use the current `master` of the spec linked above. To make sure the exact same version is used, edit `Makefile` once more and change the `BRANCH` variable in the top from `master` to `14d57a701b20135b174e97a7e755e0b49f28c097`.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nswagger version: The spec uses Swagger 2.0\r\nOS: Linux (official docker image)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1621/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
