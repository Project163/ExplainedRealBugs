There is a complex type (JWK), which is returned by API and already modeled within app with existing type (\"github.com/mendsley/gojwk\"). This type is able to unmarshal itself from json, besides, it does some computations to decode keys after that (because of that I cannot replace it with generated one).\r\n\r\nCurrently, I described fields of JWK in the yaml spec and go-swagger generates me a parallel type,  which I have to convert to desired type copying all fields one-by-one. I wonder, if some more convenient option exists for that? May be I can provide desired type name in yaml spec somehow, so that go-swagger would use it instead of generating a new one?\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n\r\nswagger 2.0 yaml\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/778/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
