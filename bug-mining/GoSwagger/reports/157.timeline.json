is there something that can be worked out to get gentoo support included in the release process?\n\nSure, when there are new releases ready to be rolled out just warn me and I'll test a live git snapshot on x86_64, x86_32, and arm7+ (complete with Unit Testing). Then I'll report a success or whatever is amiss before the official release.\n\nI do it regularly for several official packages; as a reference, take Asciinema's work-flow as an example: https://github.com/asciinema/discussions/issues/143  They use a specific issue with which new releases are signalled and then every GNU/Linux distribution maintainers report their feedbacks.\n\nIt works quite well as a solution, but just in case I'm open to other suggestions too. I have no particular preference.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/199330028/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Dr-Terrible","id":200897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDg5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible","html_url":"https://github.com/Dr-Terrible","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"Dr-Terrible","id":200897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDg5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible","html_url":"https://github.com/Dr-Terrible","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Terrible/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-31T11:49:23Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T11:49:23Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/549","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/549/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/549/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/549/events","html_url":"https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/549","id":157652675,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNTc2NTI2NzU=","number":549,"title":"go-swagger
