Well, I tried to sort it out myself, but have a couple of questions and a sense that may be I am heading in a wrong direction. Could you please take a look at [the gist](https://gist.github.com/nikolay-turpitko/a2a79a5b83462339bcf0fefccc306690)?\r\n\r\nWhat I want to achieve. I have [this definitions in the swagger yaml spec](https://gist.github.com/nikolay-turpitko/a2a79a5b83462339bcf0fefccc306690#file-spec-yaml-L265) - an array of JWKs, and I want JWK be modeled with [this existing go class](https://github.com/mendsley/gojwk/blob/master/key.go), which come from the lib. I wrapped lib's class with [my own one](https://gist.github.com/nikolay-turpitko/a2a79a5b83462339bcf0fefccc306690#file-jwk-go) to add a stub Validate method (so that generated code be able to compile). Now I want from the go-swagger that it generate me a go code with an array of my custom jwk elements.\r\n\r\nWhat I tried so far. Not sure, whether it is a misuse for  `x-go-name` and `x-go-package` tags, but I like names and decided to use them, [I added these tags to the JsonWebKey type definition in the spec](https://gist.github.com/nikolay-turpitko/a2a79a5b83462339bcf0fefccc306690#file-spec-yaml-L305). Next, I hacked go-swagger's `generator/model.go` to skip the definition with `x-go-package` tag. And hacked `typeResolver` to return `jwk.Key` as go type for it (name constructed as base name of the package from the `x-go-package` plus name from the `x-go-name`). I created a [patch](https://gist.github.com/nikolay-turpitko/a2a79a5b83462339bcf0fefccc306690#file-patch) to illustrate changes (it's not a PR, just for the sake of the question). OK, with these changes it [kinda did what I wanted](https://gist.github.com/nikolay-turpitko/a2a79a5b83462339bcf0fefccc306690#file-json_web_key_set-go). This code compiled and go tests in `go-swagger/genearator` passed (have not tried all other tests yet, though).\r\n\r\nIt's almost OK, but I cannot figure out where the import string came from. It magically appeared and happened to be correct. But if I change package name to, for example `gojwk`, it finds and imports the package with the same name from the lib, not the package from my project. I want to put my full package name from the `x-go-package` somewhere, so that it always be used.\r\n\r\nAnd overall, this hack feels a bit clumsy, I'd anticipate to fix the method t.goTypeName() instead, so that approach would work not only in `resolveSchemaRef`, but whenever t.goTypeName() invoked. But if I try to move fix there, some existing go tests fails. Also, some hack already existed for `x-go-name` exactly at the same spots.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/267758815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nikolay-turpitko","id":1192730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTI3MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1192730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikolay-turpitko","html_url":"https://github.com/nikolay-turpitko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikolay-turpitko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikolay-turpitko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikolay-turpitko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikolay-turpitko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikolay-turpitko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikolay-turpitko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikolay-turpitko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikolay-turpitko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikolay-turpitko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":897578981,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODk3NTc4OTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/events/897578981","actor":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-12-17T11:55:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":897578982,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDg5NzU3ODk4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/events/897578982","actor":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-12-17T11:55:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/267880572","html_url":"https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/778#issuecomment-267880572","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/778","id":267880572,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2Nzg4MDU3Mg==","user":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User"
