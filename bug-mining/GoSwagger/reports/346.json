Problem statement\r\n\r\nWhen using the `maxProperties` property in a schema, then generated validation logic incorrectly checks the length of the base object as opposed to the length of the property that's being validated.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (m *SomeThing) validateData(formats strfmt.Registry) error {\r\n\tif swag.IsZero(m.Data) { // not required\r\n\t\treturn nil\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tnprops := len(m) // <-- ERROR: len(m) should be len(m.Data)\r\n\r\n\t// maxProperties: 20\r\n\tif nprops > 20 {\r\n\t\treturn errors.TooManyProperties(\"data\", \"body\", 20)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"SomeThing\": {\r\n      \"properties\": {\r\n        \"data\": {\r\n          \"additionalProperties\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"object\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"maxProperties\": 20,\r\n          \"type\": \"object\",\r\n          \"x-nullable\": true\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"type\": \"object\"\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Create a schema with a component schema that has the above content\r\n2. Generate models `swagger generate models -f ./spec.json -t ./out`\r\n3. Generated code is non-compilable.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: v0.26.1\r\ngo version: go1.16.4 darwin/amd64\r\nOS:  MacOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2587/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2587/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
