When I try uploading a file via the client, the server receives 0 bytes when I try access the body.\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n\r\n```\r\nswagger: \"2.0\"\r\nbasePath: /\r\nschemes: \r\n  - http\r\nconsumes: \r\n  - application/json\r\nproduces: \r\n  - application/json\r\n\r\npaths:\r\n  /upload:\r\n    post:\r\n      tags:\r\n      - uploads\r\n      summary: uploads\r\n      operationId: upload#File\r\n      consumes:\r\n      - multipart/form-data\r\n      parameters:\r\n      - name: file\r\n        in: formData\r\n        type: file\r\n        required: true\r\n      responses:\r\n        \"200\":\r\n          description: OK\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGenerate the client from the above swagger, then try using it upload files:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfile := ... // populate some file\r\nclient.Uploads.UploadFile(context.Background(), uploads.NewUploadFileParams().WithFile(file))\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn my server, I do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc (a *API) UploadFile(ctx context.Context, in ops.UploadFileParams) middleware.Responder {\r\n\tmybuffer := make([]byte, 1024*10)\r\n\tw, err := in.File.Read(mybuffer)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\tpanic(err)\r\n\t}\r\n\tfmt.Println(w)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will always print `0` when I try submitting the file via the client. However, if I use Postman to submit the file, it works correctly -- it prints non-zero.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: 0.17.2 \r\ngo version: go1.11.2 darwin/amd64\r\nOS:  macOS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1838/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
