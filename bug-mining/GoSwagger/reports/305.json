Problem statement\r\n\r\nIf schema data containing backticks end up in struct (etc.) tags of generated Go code, the tag generation is not handling quotation of tags properly. ( Outer quotes would need to be \" instead of backtick with inner double quotes being escaped. One solution is to do this with _all_ tags, but that would make the generated code ugly,  and `go fmt` doesn't clean it up.)\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n\r\nBackticks are legal, e.g. in `XMLObject`, the [name](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/#xmlObject) parameter is a `string` with no further restrictions ...\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI've attached a minimal extract from a real-world public schema (https://api.mouser.com/api/docs/ui/index) which ends up generating broken code.  Executed as (`swagger generate client -f test.json.txt`), here are the relevant bits:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// schema\r\n\"xml\" : {\r\n    \"name\" : \"KeyValuePair`2\",\r\n    \"wrapped\" : true\r\n}\r\n// go IS\r\n(...) `json:\"ScheduledReleases\" xml:\"KeyValuePair`2\"`\r\n\r\n// go SHOULD\r\n(...) \"json:\\\"ScheduledReleases\\\" xml:\\\"KeyValuePair`2\\\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n[test.json.txt](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/files/5538040/test.json.txt)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you can't escape backticks within backticks, so Tags need to revert to double quotes containing escaped quotation marks ...\r\n\r\n(Also, I'm well aware that this is _terribly awfully unaesthetic_ style and it leaves me scratching my head asking myself what sort of a _deranged monster_ would do such a thing, but as far as I can tell it's perfectly legal.)\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: current (2020-11-13) master (  8831a62b )\r\ngo version: ```\r\ngo version go1.14.3 linux/amd64```\r\nOS:   \r\n```\r\n$ lsb_release  -a\r\nNo LSB modules are available.\r\nDistributor ID:\tUbuntu\r\nDescription:\tUbuntu 20.04.1 LTS\r\nRelease:\t20.04\r\nCodename:\tfocal\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2423/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
