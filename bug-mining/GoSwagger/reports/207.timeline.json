Problem statement\r\nWhenever a schema declares a default value, the corresponding generated structure is properly initialized, like in:\r\n```yaml\r\nparameters:\r\n  - in: body\r\n    name: myBodyParam\r\n    schema:\r\n      type: object\r\n      properties:\r\n        p1: \r\n          type: string\r\n        p2:\r\n           type: integer\r\n      default:\r\n        p1: abc\r\n        p2: 12\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when defaults are declared at a lower level, no initialization takes place, as in:\r\n```yaml\r\nparameters:\r\n  - in: body\r\n    name: myBodyParam\r\n    schema:\r\n      type: object\r\n      properties:\r\n        p1: \r\n          type: string\r\n          default: abc\r\n        p2:\r\n          type: integer\r\n          default: 12\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like the \"schema\" term used in the [json schema spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fge-json-schema-validation-00#section-6.2) has been taken to the letter, making it equivalent to the swagger schema term.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\ngenerate server with structures proposed  as examples and submit uninitialized body\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: x.x.x  \r\ngo version:

Problem statement\r\n\r\nAccording to the docs here https://goswagger.io/use/server.html#your-own-code\r\n\r\n> Every incoming request is described as a bunch of input parameters which have been validated prior to calling the handler. So whenever your code is executed, the input parameters are guaranteed to be valid according to what the swagger specification prescribes.\r\n\r\nHowever, in practice the server generated does not actually validate input. I'm able to not specify required properties `resource_type` or `resource_id`, or even send an empty body and the code path still reaches my route handler.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n```yaml\r\npaths:\r\n  /resource_schema:\r\n    put:\r\n      tags: [ResourceSchema]\r\n      description: Find or create a `ResourceSchema` based on the resource's type and id\r\n      parameters:\r\n        - in: body\r\n          name: input\r\n          required: true\r\n          schema:\r\n            type: object\r\n            properties:\r\n              resource_type: { $ref: '#/definitions/ResourceType' }\r\n              resource_id: { type: string }\r\n            required: [resource_type, resource_id]\r\n      responses:\r\n        200:\r\n          description: Success\r\n          schema: { $ref: '#/definitions/ResourceSchema' }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\nswagger generate server -t servers/go\r\ngo run servers/go/cmd/schema-service-server/main.go\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen make a request to the server, such as\r\n```\r\ncurl -X PUT \"http://localhost:60223/v1/resource_schema\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"content-type: application/json\" -d \"{}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: dev (latest master as of time of issue)\r\ngo version go1.8.1

Problem statement\r\n\r\nI have found that in code generated for a swagger object that contains a field which itself is an array of other nested objects, the `Validate` function for the array field is never called. \r\n\r\nThe symptom of this problem is that I can submit a parent object with an array of children that are missing their required fields.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n## swagger specification\r\n```\r\n---\r\nad_profile:\r\n    type: object\r\n    required:\r\n      - id\r\n      - member_id\r\n    properties:\r\n      id:\r\n        type: integer\r\n      member_id:\r\n        type: integer\r\n      members:\r\n        type: array\r\n        items:\r\n          type: object\r\n          required:\r\n            - member_id\r\n            - status\r\n          properties:\r\n            member_id:\r\n              type: integer\r\n            status:\r\n              type: string\r\n```\r\n## generated function to validate AdProfile.Members\r\n\r\nThis function looks right to me, because it attempts to call `Validate` on each of the items in the array.\r\n```\r\n// Validate validates this ad profile members\r\nfunc (m AdProfileMembers) Validate(formats strfmt.Registry) error {\r\n    var res []error\r\n\r\n    for i := 0; i < len(m); i++ {\r\n\r\n        if swag.IsZero(m[i]) { // not required\r\n            continue\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if m[i] != nil {\r\n\r\n            if err := m[i].Validate(formats); err != nil {\r\n                if ve, ok := err.(*errors.Validation); ok {\r\n                    return ve.ValidateName(strconv.Itoa(i))\r\n                }\r\n                return err\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if len(res) > 0 {\r\n        return errors.CompositeValidationError(res...)\r\n    }\r\n    return nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, this function never gets called while validating the parent AdProfile object. This is the generated code that validates the array on the parent object (the array is called Members):\r\n```\r\nfunc (m *AdProfile) validateMembers(formats strfmt.Registry) error {\r\n\r\n    if err := validate.Required(\"members\", \"body\", m.Members); err != nil {\r\n        return err\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt seems to me that this function is missing a call to `m.Members.Validate(formats)`. This would cause us to call validate individually on each of the children in the Members array.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, the above function is not generated _at all_ if the array field is not a required field. This seems wrong. Even if the array itself is not required, if is provided and there are objects inside it, they should be validated according to their required fields. Right now, this is _not_ happening. \r\n\r\n## Fix\r\n\r\nI've confirmed with that we if we add a call to `m.Members.Validate(formats)` here, we will correctly validate the children objects (AdProfileMembersItems):\r\n```\r\nfunc (m *AdProfile) validateMembers(formats strfmt.Registry) error {\r\n\r\n    if err := validate.Required(\"members\", \"body\", m.Members); err != nil {\r\n        return err\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if err := m.Members.Validate(formats); err != nil {\r\n        return err\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\nPosting to the API with bad data produces the expected output:\r\n```\r\n{\\\"code\\\":602,\\\"message\\\":\\\"allow_pending_creatives in body is required\\\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: 0.10.0  \r\ngo version: 1.8\r\nOS: Linux Ubuntu

But if we mark the body parameter required, the validation will show in the auto-generated code.\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n**Case : 1**\r\n```yaml\r\nprofileCfg: \r\n           type: object\r\n           properties:\r\n               value1:\r\n                   type: integer\r\n                   format: int32\r\n              value2:\r\n                  type: integer\r\n                  format: int32                    \r\nprofileCfgs:\r\n           type: array\r\n           x-omitempty: true\r\n           items:\r\n              $ref: '#definitions/profileCfg'\r\nProfile:\r\n           type: object\r\n           properties: \r\n                  profileCfg:\r\n                       $ref: '#definitions/profileCfgs'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Case: 2**\r\n```yaml\r\nprofileCfg: \r\n           type: object\r\n           properties:\r\n               value1:\r\n                   type: integer\r\n                   format: int32\r\n              value2:\r\n                  type: integer\r\n                  format: int32                    \r\nprofileCfgs:\r\n           type: array\r\n           x-omitempty: true\r\n           items:\r\n              $ref: '#definitions/profileCfg'\r\nProfile:\r\n           type: object\r\n           required:\r\n               - profileCfg\r\n           properties: \r\n                  profileCfg:\r\n                       $ref: '#definitions/profileCfgs'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Case 3**\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nprofileCfg: \r\n           type: object\r\n           properties:\r\n               value1:\r\n                   type: integer\r\n                   format: int32\r\n              value2:\r\n                  type: integer\r\n                  format: int32            \r\nProfile:\r\n           type: object\r\n           required:\r\n               - profileCfg\r\n           properties: \r\n                  profileCfg:\r\n                       type: array\r\n                       x-omitempty: true\r\n                       items:\r\n                         $ref: '#definitions/profileCfg'\r\n```\r\n                    \r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGenerate the server based on this swagger\r\nIn the Case1, the validation will not be generated.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (m *Profile) Validate(formats strfmt.Registry) error {\r\n        var res []error\r\n        if len(res) > 0 {\r\n                              return errors\r\n        }\r\n         return nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the Case2, the validation will be generated successfully.\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (m *profile) Validate(formats strfmt.Registry) error {\r\n      var res []error\r\n      if err := m.validateProfile(formats); err != nil {\r\n                res = append(res, err)\r\n      }\r\n     if len(res) > 0 {\r\n                              return errors\r\n        }\r\n         return nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the Case3, if we remove the refer to the array struct, and without mark the area required the validation will still be generated same as the code in the Case 2. (Case 3 validation generation is by the fix in the issue #1392 and #1093.\r\n\r\nSo I think there may an issue that I have to mark the parameter required which it referring to the array struct if I want the validation to generate.
