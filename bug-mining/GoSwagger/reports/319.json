Problem statement\r\n\r\nUpdating to latest go-openapi/spec exposed a known issue on windows with $refs (see #go-openapi/spec#97).\r\n\r\nSince the update brought a lot of improvements and bug fixes from various contributors, I am updating go-swagger\r\nand temporarily disable our appveyor CI run on windows.\r\n\r\nSolving the windows issue on go-openapi/spec is not that easy, however. My hunch is that we have to change the\r\nref normalizer and canonicallize URIs on local files (e.g. file:///C:/mypath instead of C:\\mypath).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nOn windows:\r\ngo test ./...\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: x.x.x  \r\ngo version: x.x.x  \r\nOS:   windows\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2428/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
