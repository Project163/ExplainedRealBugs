I generated a schema which orgiinally included the archivedlogs client, but after regenerating it a few times, it removed the archivedlogs, but added userfiles. It seems it's not always using all clients it generated in the frontend_client constructor.\n\nHere's the diff (it took me a few client generations to get this to happen since it doesn't always occur). It seems to be limited to the archivedlogs and userfiles packages, not sure why the others aren't being added/removed between generation.\n\n``` diff\ndiff --git a/common/go-quay/client/quay_frontend_client.go b/common/go-quay/client/quay_frontend_client.go\nindex 52b5e16..9487e26 100644\n--- a/common/go-quay/client/quay_frontend_client.go\n+++ b/common/go-quay/client/quay_frontend_client.go\n@@ -7,6 +7,7 @@ import (\n    \"github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/client\"\n    \"github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/strfmt\"\n\n+   \"github.com/foo/common/go-quay/client/archivedlogs\"\n    \"github.com/foo/common/go-quay/client/billing\"\n    \"github.com/foo/common/go-quay/client/build\"\n    \"github.com/foo/common/go-quay/client/discovery\"\n@@ -25,13 +26,14 @@ import (\n    \"github.com/foo/common/go-quay/client/team\"\n    \"github.com/foo/common/go-quay/client/trigger\"\n    \"github.com/foo/common/go-quay/client/user\"\n-   \"github.com/foo/common/go-quay/client/userfiles\"\n )\n\n // New creates a new quay frontend client\n func New(transport client.Transport, formats strfmt.Registry) *QuayFrontend {\n    cli := new(QuayFrontend)\n\n+   cli.Archivedlogs = archivedlogs.New(transport, formats)\n+\n    cli.Billing = billing.New(transport, formats)\n\n    cli.Build = build.New(transport, formats)\n@@ -68,13 +70,13 @@ func New(transport client.Transport, formats strfmt.Registry) *QuayFrontend {\n\n    cli.User = user.New(transport, formats)\n\n-   cli.Userfiles = userfiles.New(transport, formats)\n-\n    return cli\n }\n\n // QuayFrontend is a client for quay frontend\n type QuayFrontend struct {\n+   Archivedlogs *archivedlogs.Client\n+\n    Billing *billing.Client\n\n    Build *build.Client\n@@ -110,6 +112,4 @@ type QuayFrontend struct {\n    Trigger *trigger.Client\n\n    User *user.Client\n-\n-   Userfiles *userfiles.Client\n }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
