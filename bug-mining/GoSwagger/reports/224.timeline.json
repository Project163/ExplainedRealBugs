about using the following constructs:\r\n```go\r\nfunc logDebug(...) bool {\r\n log.Printf(....)\r\n}\r\n\r\n_ := Debug && logDebug(\"message\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we could move the logDebug() func to any logger available out there. For instance `rs/zerolog` seems an efficient, yet simple, one.\r\n\r\nFor the `json.MarshalIndent()` stuff, another wrapper would be appropriate, e.g: \r\n```go\r\nfunc logDebugAsJson(v) bool {\r\n bbb, _ := json.MarshalIndent(v,\"\", \" \")\r\n log.Printf(string(b))\r\nreturn true\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would make code more readable and test coverage analysis more accurate.\r\n\r\nAnother useful point is to enable debug for a given module. Currently, all go-openapi packages are guided by the same env variable `SWAGGER_DEBUG`.\r\n\r\nDebugging text would be clearer if we could support things like `export SWAGGER_DEBUG=go-swagger:validate:runtime`.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/386225700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1711324167,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3MTEzMjQxNjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/events/1711324167","actor":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bc015b1e5d8159565971872f9878ee9cd4f57a1b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fredbi/go-swagger/commits/bc015b1e5d8159565971872f9878ee9cd4f57a1b","created_at":"2018-07-02T10:51:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-02T10:52:15Z","updated_at":"2018-07-02T10:52:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1598","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1598/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1598/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1598/events","html_url":"https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/pull/1598","id":337468541,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTk4NjQyMDQ1","number":1598,"title":"Refactor
