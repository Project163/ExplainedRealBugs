Too many anonymous OAIGen definitions generated. \r\n> OAIGen are generated whenever there is a name conflict when flattening the spec. \r\n> In some obvious cases, however, this conflict may be resolved without creating an additional definition.\r\n> Flatten should issue a warning to the user to explain this \"OAIGen\" creation.\r\n\r\n2.  Have an option to stop flattening as soon as references are good enough for the generator \r\n> At this stage it is not required for codegen to create all $ref's for complex things \r\n> (this is _minimal flattening_ ).\r\n> All codegen will assume that this step has been completed, code checking for remote $ref\r\n> (e.g. `!ref.HasFragmentsOnly`) may be removed\r\n\r\n3.  Full flattening should consider maps of simple things as simple things (e.g. don't create a definition for map[]{my object}, the definition for {myobject} should be enough)\r\n\r\n4. Have an option to remove unused definitions (e.g. `#/parameters` which are expanded), so as to produce a pristine spec.\r\n\r\nI propose the following modification to `swagger` CLI options:\r\n- `--with-flatten=minimal` (default)\r\n- `--with-flatten=full` (correspond to current default)\r\n- `--with-expand` | `--with-flatten=expand` (corresponds to current `--skip-flatten`)\r\n- `--skip-flatten` is desupported\r\n\r\n`--with-flatten` may support multiple options, e.g:\r\n`--with-flatten:full,verbose,remove-unused`\r\n\r\nSome more suggestions to come later on:\r\n5. In full flatten mode, more options to control how allOf are handled\r\n6. In full flatten mode propagating x-go-name (as prefix) to newly created definitions: creating new definitions introduces some naming conventions. If a x-go-name has been set in the original structure, new names are no consistent with their container...\r\n> Example: if an array of complex items has `x-go-name: zzz`, the items definition created should have `x-go-name: zzzItems`\r\n \r\nSee also #1559 \r\n\r\nPoints (1), (2) and (3) and (4) are currently under testing on my dev.\r\nI'll do my best to issue a \"how-to flatten a spec\" doc with this series of PR's.\r\n\r\nPoints (5) and (6) would require some preparatory work on models.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: 0.14\r\ngo version: x.x.x  \r\nOS:   \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1572/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1572/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
