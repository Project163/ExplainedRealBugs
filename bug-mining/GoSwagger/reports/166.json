It's missing some of Go builtin types.\n\nError generated when unsupported type is used:\n\n`package reflect, error is: unknown primitive \"uintptr\"`\n## Steps to reproduce\n\nOne of the missing types is uintptr which is used in e.g. Go reflect package, error would be triggered by following example.\n\nExample code that triggers the error:\n\n``` go\nimport \"reflect\"\n// User\n//\n// Use documentation here...\n//\n// swagger:model\ntype User struct {\n    // reflect type for testing reflect\n    //\n    // required: false\n    Rt reflect.Type `json:\"rt\"`\n    // the id for this user\n    //\n    // required: true\n    Id int64 `json:\"id\"`\n    Name string `json:\"name\"`\n}\n```\n\nSwagger invocation:\n\n``` bash\n$ swagger generate spec -m\npackage reflect, error is: unknown primitive \"uintptr\"\n```\n\nSeems like a good solution would be to support all Go builtin types as listed at [https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/](https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/) (except for the *Type types which are there for documentation purposes only).\n\nI am not sure what the swagger type/format should be for the missing Go builtin types, seems like some of them are not trivial to handle (e.g. byte, complex).\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/560/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/560/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
