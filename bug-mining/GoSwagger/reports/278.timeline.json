And it looks like when ExampleResponse gets processed first things work out fine, but when the ExampleListResponse gets processed first it doesn't add the base type as discovered

I found out that the `Models` map while iterating over is being updated with new embedded models (btw. should that happen?).

this PR does / why we need it**:\r\nCurrently, the generated go-kubermatic client is not able to send an appropriate PATCH request to the API server, it's because of the `Patch` field type which is `[]byte` ([example](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubermatic/pull/4917/files#diff-2ace21458585d6d9d5e1ce87136e0fdcL991)) instead it should be `json.RawMessage`. \r\n\r\n`[]byte` representation in JSON is base64 so the API server returns bad request code when receiving such a payload\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the go-swagger pkg must be upgraded to handle json.RawMessage type.\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?**:\r\n<!--  Write your release note:\r\n1. Enter your extended release note in the below block. If the PR requires additional action from users switching to the new release, include the string \"action required\".\r\n2.

Problem statement\r\n\r\n`go-swagger` generates different specs from the same codebase in repeated runs. The reason for this is a swagger annotated type embedding another one.\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nClone https://github.com/lukasmalkmus/swagger-issue\r\nFollow the `README.md`\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: 0.21.0  \r\ngo version: 1.13.6  \r\nOS:   macOS\r\n\r\nI haven't had a deeper look yet. But the generator seems to act on one of the two types in question randomly. Since I usually trust the stdlib when it comes to loading the code packages, I suspect the bug in question could be caused by getting data from a map (since maps are randomly orderer, we get different types on different runs).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2183/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2985902122,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5ODU5MDIxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/events/2985902122","actor":{"login":"mfranczy","id":27352691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzUyNjkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27352691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy","html_url":"https://github.com/mfranczy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"292a39a5f0a477523c6485003ab8a08b38685dac","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mfranczy/go-swagger/commits/292a39a5f0a477523c6485003ab8a08b38685dac","created_at":"2020-01-28T14:41:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3002707380,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMwMDI3MDczODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/events/3002707380","actor":{"login":"mfranczy","id":27352691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzUyNjkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27352691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy","html_url":"https://github.com/mfranczy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"06918b43a58170d7df51d6a88b672183f9a8ff91","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mfranczy/go-swagger/commits/06918b43a58170d7df51d6a88b672183f9a8ff91","created_at":"2020-02-03T15:41:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/581484012","html_url":"https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2066#issuecomment-581484012","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2066","id":581484012,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTQ4NDAxMg==","user":{"login":"mfranczy","id":27352691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzUyNjkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27352691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy","html_url":"https://github.com/mfranczy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfranczy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-03T15:59:02Z","updated_at":"2020-02-03T15:59:02Z","body":"I
