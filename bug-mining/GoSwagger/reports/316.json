Problem statement\r\nSimple schema provided below doesn't validate according to swagger specification 2.0:\r\n```\r\nThe swagger spec at \"./rest/swagger.yaml\" is invalid against swagger

specification\r\n```yaml\r\nswagger: '2.0'\r\ninfo:\r\n  version: 1.0.0\r\n  title: Project\r\nhost: '127.0.0.1:8080'\r\nbasePath: '/api/v1'\r\nschemes:\r\n  - http\r\nconsumes:\r\n  -
