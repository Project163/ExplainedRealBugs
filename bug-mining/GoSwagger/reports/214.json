Problem statement\r\n\r\nIt appears that having a polymorphic type containing a field named \"data\" included in an allOf definition causes an issue in the generated code, specifically in the UnmarshalJSON function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc (m *UpdateObjectAllOf1) UnmarshalJSON(raw []byte) error {\r\n\tvar data struct { // <-- here, \"data\" is a struct\r\n\t\tData json.RawMessage `json:\"data,omitempty\"`\r\n\t}\r\n\tbuf := bytes.NewBuffer(raw)\r\n\tdec := json.NewDecoder(buf)\r\n\tdec.UseNumber()\r\n\r\n\tif err := dec.Decode(&data); err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn err\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tdata, err := UnmarshalObject(bytes.NewBuffer(data.Data), runtime.JSONConsumer()) // <-- but here, UnmarshalObject returns something satisfying the \"Object\" interface, which the original \"data\" does not\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this could be fixed by adding `Field` or something similar to the `{{ camelize .Name }}` here, if I'm understanding the code correctly:
