Problem statement\r\n\r\nHi! I have a swagger API that sends files (specification below)\r\n\r\nI have generated the server code with go-swagger and I'm trying to implement the handler to return a file. However, I don't know how to Close it in the handler:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n\tfunc(params operations.GetFileParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {\r\n\t\tfile, fileErr := os.Open(\"/data/\" + params.File)\r\n\t\tif fileErr != nil {\r\n\t\t\tif os.IsNotExist(fileErr) {\r\n\t\t\t\treturn operations.NewGetFileNotFound()\r\n\t\t\t} else if os.IsPermission(fileErr) {\r\n\t\t\t\treturn operations.NewGetFileForbidden()\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\treturn operations.NewGetFileInternalServerError()\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t// defer file.Close()\r\n\r\n\t\treturn operations.NewGetFileOK().WithPayload(file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried defer but it doesn't work because the file is closed before being read, which provokes an error. And I'd rather not load the whole file in memory.\r\n\r\nI have seen a similar question: https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/515\r\nBut to be honest I don't understand the answer.\r\n\r\nI know that I could just modify the code generated by swagger but I'd rather find a cleaner way that would not involve changing it each time I update the specification.\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nresponses:\r\n  200:\r\n    description: The markdown file that was requested.\r\n    schema:\r\n      type: file\r\n  403:\r\n    description: Unauthorized.\r\n  404:\r\n    description: Not found.\r\n  500:\r\n    description: Internal error.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: master\r\ngo version: 1.10\r\nOS: Fedora 28 (Linux)\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
