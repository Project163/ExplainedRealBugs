That's what I was referring to ... I don't think it's possible to do that with the current  template system. Consider the main bit affected:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{{ pascalize .Name}} {{ template \"schemaType\" . }} `\r\n  {{- $prop := . }}\r\n  {{- range $i, $structTag := $.StructTags }}\r\n    {{- if gt $i 0 }} {{ end }}\r\n    {{- template \"structTag\" dict \"Tag\" $structTag \"Schema\" $prop }}\r\n  {{- else }}\r\n    {{- template \"structTag\" dict \"Tag\" \"json\" \"Schema\" $prop }}\r\n  {{- end }}\r\n  {{- if .XMLName }} xml:\"{{ .XMLName }}\"{{ end }}\r\n  {{- if .CustomTag }} {{ .CustomTag }}{{ end }}`\r\n{{ end }}\r\n```\r\n(from: `generator/templates/structfield.gotmpl`)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe backticks themselves are literals in the template and there are numerous fields to check for the existence of backticks in the values. If any of those values contain backticks, a different template  would have to be chosen. Compare that with escaping double quotes in all values and using double quotes instead of backticks for the surrounding quotes.\r\n\r\nI agree that would be super ugly, but the ugliness is constrained the generated code that is rarely touched. I can try to put together a quick PoC to check whether this is as simple a fix as I presume ... I don't understand the code base well enough to contemplate how this could be done any other way without a complete rewrite of this mechanism. If you have any pointers, I'd be open to try though.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, I'm reluctant to start work on a fix because I can't get the unit tests in `generator` to pass. Is this a bug I should report or is there something I need to do beyond just calling `go test`?\r\n\r\nI'm running tests using: `$ go test ./generator` the output is fairly large, because apparently the tests are logging to stderr, I'm attaching a copy of the output.

#2445 \r\n\r\nMy use case might be a bit weird. I have a service, let's call it A which calls service B. Service B has a swagger spec which I use to generate a client for it. Service A has a few cases where it will straight up return a model generated by go-swagger from the spec of service B.\r\n\r\nWhen I generate the swagger spec for service A, I have a problem because the example field in the swagger spec of service B is not rendered on the models. So the service A swagger spec does not contain the examples, which is not ideal.\r\n\r\nIt might sound a bit convoluted but that's how we setup our thing. We use https://github.com/swaggo/swag to generate the service spec (legacy reasons), and it needs that example
