polymorphic marshal\" is triggered by the type having a property that is a parametric type or an array of a polymorphic type:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  Values:\r\n    type: \"object\"\r\n    properties:\r\n

the other of `Array` or `Value` (since Swagger doesn't have `anyOf` yet), and this returns an error at the read of `Value` when it isn't provided.  It checks to see if `Array` is there before it tries to read it, but not `Value`.\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// UnmarshalJSON unmarshals this object with a polymorphic type from a JSON structure\r\nfunc (m
