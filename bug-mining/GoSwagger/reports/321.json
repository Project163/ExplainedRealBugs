This works for basic request parameters, however, I'd like to expand my logging to include the user identifier.  I am using an API key header to identify the user, so I think I need a way for my logging middleware to be aware of the Principal, or have the authentication handler be aware of the request context.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a suggestion for how this might be accomplished?","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1472/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
