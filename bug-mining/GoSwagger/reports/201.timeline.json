Problem statement\r\nI have a issue when I do the test under restapi and when I try to shutdown the sever during the compile. The deadlock happened. I have checked the code under https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/examples/tutorials/custom-server/gen/restapi/server.go and found that there is no buffer for the channel when the shutdown was defined under NewServer. The buffer may need to be added under NewServer function. The code in the code base now is \r\n```go\r\nfunc NewServer(api *operations.GreeterAPI) *Server {\r\n\ts := new(Server)\r\n\r\n\ts.shutdown = make(chan struct{})\r\n\ts.api = api\r\n\treturn s\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Swagger specification\r\nThe code under go-swagger/generator/templates/server/server.gotmpl may need to be updated.\r\n```go\r\n// NewServer creates a new api {{ humanize .Name }} server but does not configure it\r\nfunc NewServer(api *{{ .Package }}.{{ pascalize .Name }}API) *Server {\r\n\ts := new(Server)\r\n  {{ if .UsePFlags }}\r\n        s.EnabledListeners = enabledListeners\r\n\ts.CleanupTimeout = cleanupTimout\r\n\ts.MaxHeaderSize = maxHeaderSize\r\n\ts.SocketPath = socketPath\r\n\ts.Host = stringEnvOverride(host, \"\", \"HOST\")\r\n\ts.Port = intEnvOverride(port, 0, \"PORT\")\r\n\ts.ListenLimit = listenLimit\r\n\ts.KeepAlive = keepAlive\r\n\ts.ReadTimeout = readTimeout\r\n\ts.WriteTimeout = writeTimeout\r\n\ts.TLSHost = stringEnvOverride(tlsHost, s.Host, \"TLS_HOST\", \"HOST\")\r\n\ts.TLSPort = intEnvOverride(tlsPort, 0, \"TLS_PORT\")\r\n\ts.TLSCertificate = stringEnvOverride(tlsCertificate, \"\", \"TLS_CERTIFICATE\")\r\n\ts.TLSCertificateKey = stringEnvOverride(tlsCertificateKey, \"\", \"TLS_PRIVATE_KEY\")\r\n        s.TLSCACertificate = stringEnvOverride(tlsCACertificate, \"\", \"TLS_CA_CERTIFICATE\")\r\n\ts.TLSListenLimit = tlsListenLimit\r\n\ts.TLSKeepAlive = tlsKeepAlive\r\n\ts.TLSReadTimeout = tlsReadTimeout\r\n\ts.TLSWriteTimeout = tlsWriteTimeout{{ if .ExcludeSpec }}\r\n        s.Spec = specFile\r\n  {{ end }}{{ end }}\r\n\ts.shutdown = make(chan struct{})\r\n\ts.api = api\r\n\treturn s\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nBelow is a portion of code under my test file in the restapi\r\n```go\r\n        api := operations.NewSwaggerCcmtsAPI(swaggerSpec)\r\n        server := NewServer(api)\r\n        defer server.Shutdown()\r\n        server.ConfigureFlags()\r\n        server.ConfigureAPI()\r\n        handler := server.GetHandler()\r\n```\r\nThen I initialize the tests for restapi.
