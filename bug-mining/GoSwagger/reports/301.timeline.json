suggested fix does work, and after updating all of the openapi dependencies, the code builds cleanly.\r\n\r\nIs this fix backwards compatible?  Specifically if someone on the team rebuilds w/ v0.24.0 will it work?  Or should I revert the change and wait for v0.25.1?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/663629584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hhubris","id":597957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Nzk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/597957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhubris","html_url":"https://github.com/hhubris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhubris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhubris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhubris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhubris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhubris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhubris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhubris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhubris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhubris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/663642141","html_url":"https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2362#issuecomment-663642141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2362","id":663642141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MzY0MjE0MQ==","user":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-24T17:13:41Z","updated_at":"2020-07-24T17:13:41Z","body":"There is nothing new to be expected on that >v0.25.0.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, even though we could make the package guess logic even smarter, this would be an enhancement, not a priority.\r\n\r\nI think that specifying the principal with a full package would work in v0.24.0 just as well.
