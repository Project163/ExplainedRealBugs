issue #838.\r\n\r\n## Requests from issue\r\n\r\n> Create a client with a custom httpTransport, without having to hardcode the basePath, host and schemes;\r\n\r\nThis is now possible by using the constants provided by the client package: `DefaultHost`, `DefaultBasePath` and `DefaultSchemes`.\r\n\r\n> Create a client with all defaults, except 1 customized one (e.g. a custom host, as is often required for public API's);\r\n\r\nThis is now possible by calling `NewHTTPClientWithConfig` instead of `NewHTTPClient`:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nNewHTTPClientWithConfig(nil, DefaultTransportConfig().WithHost(\"http://localhost:9000\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nLogic from `NewHTTPClient` has been moved to `NewHTTPClientWithConfig`. `NewHTTPClient` calls `NewHTTPClientWithConfig` now, with a nil value for the config value, making it default via `DefaultTransportConfig`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/843/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":913700820,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTEzNzAwODIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/events/913700820","actor":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"7b5830cb2eaaf51c960508c762a5a793386bc0e6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/commits/7b5830cb2eaaf51c960508c762a5a793386bc0e6","created_at":"2017-01-06T06:54:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":913700821,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDkxMzcwMDgyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/events/913700821","actor":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a04692fa06d45418dd7724fed6047dea3eca11ec","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/commits/a04692fa06d45418dd7724fed6047dea3eca11ec","created_at":"2017-01-06T06:54:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
