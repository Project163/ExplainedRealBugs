there an alternative to using embedded structs to populate response schema properties?\n\nI'm using go-swagger to generate a swagger spec from existing go-code and ran into something interesting. It looks as though the only way to get response fields to show under \"responses > my-response-struct > schema > properties\" is to structure the go types as embedded structs. For example:\n\n``` go\n// Some response object i want to generate a swagger spec for\n// swagger:response my-response\ntype MyResponse struct {\n    SomeField      string\n    SomeOtherField string\n}\n```\n\nGenerates:\n\n``` json\n\"responses\": {\n        \"my-response\": {\n            \"description\": \"A Style returns all the information for a particular style\",\n            \"headers\": {\n                \"SomeField\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\"\n                },\n                \"SomeOtherField\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n}\n```\n\nThe only way to get it in the schema properties where I'd expect it is to change my struct to this:\n\n``` go\n// Some response object i want to generate a swagger spec for\n// swagger:response my-response2\ntype MyEmbeddedResponse struct {\n    //in: body\n    EmbeddedThing struct {\n        SomeField      string\n        SomeOtherField string\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhich then results in my expected swagger spec:\n\n``` json\n \"my-response2\": {\n            \"description\": \"Some response object i want to generate a swagger spec for\",\n            \"schema\": {\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"SomeField\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                    },\n                    \"SomeOtherField\": {\n                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"type\": \"object\"\n            }\n        },\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/270/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/184035158","html_url":"https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/140#issuecomment-184035158","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/140","id":184035158,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDAzNTE1OA==","user":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-15T02:45:02Z","updated_at":"2016-02-15T02:45:02Z","body":"It
