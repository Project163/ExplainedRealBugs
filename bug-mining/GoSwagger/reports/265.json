We are using allOf functionality of the swagger 2.0 spec. Noticed when using allOf, there are UnmarshalJSON() and MarshalJSON() methods are implemented for generated structs are having the JSON tag starting with capital letter instead of what is defined in yaml.\r\n\r\n**Swagger spec:**\r\n```yaml\r\ndefinitions:\r\n    Pet:\r\n        type: object\r\n        properties:\r\n            name:\r\n                type: string\r\n                x-go-name: Name\r\n                x-nullable: true\r\n    Cat:\r\n        allOf:\r\n            - $ref: \"#/definitions/Pet\"\r\n            - type: \"object\"\r\n              properties:\r\n                ability:\r\n                    type: string\r\n                    x-go-name: Ability\r\n                    x-nullable: true\r\n```\r\nNow the Cat.go file in models directory has this UnmarshalJSON() method:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// UnmarshalJSON unmarshals this object from a JSON structure\r\nfunc (m *Cat) UnmarshalJSON(raw []byte) error {\r\n        // AO0\r\n        var aO0 Pet\r\n        if err := swag.ReadJSON(raw, &aO0); err != nil {\r\n                return err\r\n        }\r\n        m.Pet = aO0\r\n\r\n        // AO1\r\n        var dataAO1 struct {\r\n                Ability *string `json:\"Ability,omitempty\"`\r\n        }\r\n        if err := swag.ReadJSON(raw, &dataAO1); err != nil {\r\n                return err\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        m.Ability = dataAO1.Ability\r\n\r\n        return nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIs there a way to suppress this marshaller interface overriding methods from getting generated? We are using these models somewhere else in the implementation and we need \"Ability\" in the json tag in UnmarshalJSON() method starting with lower case 'a'.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: 0.18\r\ngo version: 1.11\r\nOS: Ubuntu\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2071/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
