I added \"required\" to the body parameter, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.  If we make a request with no body, our handler gets called and the param object has an empty body generated.\n\n`\"name\": \"container\",\n          \"in\": \"body\",\n          \"description\": \"Container to create\",\n          \"schema\": {\n            \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/ContainerConfig\"\n          },\n          \"required\": true\n`\n\ngenerates\n\n`type CreateParams struct {\n    /*Container to create\n      Required: true\n      In: body\n    */\n    Container *models.ContainerConfig\n`\n\nThe expected response is a 500 error with EOF or any type of message.  It's also expected that the middleware handles this and our handler doesn't get called.  The actual result is our handler gets called and Container is filled with an empty models.ContainerConfig.  We need a way to detect an empty body and respond to user requests appropriately.  Even if it isn't handled in the middleware, when it gets to our handler and CreateParams.Container == nil for cases where the body is missing, that would work for us.\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/366/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
