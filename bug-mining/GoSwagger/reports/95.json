The go-flags package seems to conflict with the flag package (both packages fail upon finding unknown flags) and unlike the flag package, go-flags is object-oriented, so we can not simply define the necessary flags in every file's init() function as could be done with the built-in flag package.\nAs go-flags, however, is IMHO (and apparently also in the authors') much nicer than the builtin package, I propose the following solution to integrate user-defined flags with the generated parsing step.\n\nSolution sketch:\nxxx_api.go: Add a map[string]interface{} to the XxxAPI struct\nconfigure_xxx.go: configureAPI(...): Add an example on how to populate the map with own flag groups\nmain.go: Call configureAPI before parser.Parse but after creating parser. After calling configureAPI, iterate over flags map from api object and call parser.AddGroup(key, \"\", value) for each key-value pair.\n\nWhat do you think? The only downside I currently see, is that iterating over a map is unordered and so might result in help texts with differing order with each execution.\nI am currently working on a pull request.\n","closed_by":{"login":"casualjim","id":456109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjEwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim","html_url":"https://github.com/casualjim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/casualjim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/207/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
