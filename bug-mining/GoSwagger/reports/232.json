Problem statement\r\n\r\nWhen using **go-flags** I have run into the issue that when I try to use it, the server simply gets stuck adding it to go-flags.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nfunc configureFlags(api *operations.NetroundsPocAPI) {\r\n\tapi.CommandLineOptionsGroups = []swag.CommandLineOptionsGroup{\r\n\t\tswag.CommandLineOptionsGroup{\r\n\t\t\tShortDescription: \"Netrounds PoC Options:\",\r\n\t\t\tLongDescription:  \"\",\r\n\t\t\tOptions: struct {\r\n\t\t\t\tExample1 string `long:\"example1\" description:\"Sample for showing how to configure cmd-line flags\"`\r\n\t\t\t}{},\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich I assume is a bug?\r\n\r\n### Using Pflags\r\n\r\nSo I tried switching to `--flag-strategy=pflag`\r\n\r\nIt would make sense in this mode to add a comment in `configureFlags` that it is not applicable (it will never be run by the generated `main.go`)\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nUse the above `configureFlags` example and things lock up.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version:\r\nUsed docker image:\r\n```\r\nquay.io/goswagger/swagger          latest              3694e4352134\r\n```\r\nWhich used:\r\n```\r\nversion: dev\r\ncommit: 2d443fa7eea569af9f20dd6f0302aef6c3b10651\r\n```\r\n\r\ngo version:\r\n```\r\ngo version go1.9.4 linux/amd64\r\n```\r\n\r\nOS:
