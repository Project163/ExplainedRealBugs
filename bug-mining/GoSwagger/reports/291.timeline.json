Executive summary\r\n\r\nWe use swagger to generate model and operation API for Docker Engine (aka [Moby](https://github.com/moby/moby)), and we believe that types and structures should be separated from the code. This is why we are using an option to disable generating `Validate()` methods.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this option has disappeared, making us stick to a very old go-swagger codebase, which is becoming more and more problematic, e.g.\r\n* problems with unstable/unsorted output (https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/846, example: https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/38832#issuecomment-472106785)\r\n* golang 1.13 compatibility issue (https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2058)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nBoth `swagger generate model` and `swagger generate operation` used to have an option to disable generating `Validate()` methods. The option name was `--skip-validator` (what was in line with other options such as `--skip-struct` or `--skip-responses`), it was added:\r\n\r\n* for `generate model`: by commit 38dbdd808fb157f84724e19269d310128f7df71d (\"move generator2 to generator package\", Feb 16 2015, possibly earlier but there's no git history AFAICS)\r\n* for `generate operation`: by commit 041580674330b64a393d7353ca13ffe4ab540924 (\"Add a --skip-validator flag for generate operation\", Oct 5 2016)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this option was silently removed from both commands by commit d2aae8150c526d861828ee0e8a16623df01d3fb5 (\"Added an option in genOpts\", Jan 4, 2018).\r\n\r\nA similarly named (but with very different semantics) option, `--skip-validation`, was added by commit 78f848e7f01c8dca5c2744c69b08d9732d60b537 (\"validate spec prior to gen. client/server\", Jan 8, 2017). As suggested in https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/commit/d2aae8150c526d861828ee0e8a16623df01d3fb5#commitcomment-29777292, a possible user confusion between `--skip-validation` and `--skip-validator` was the reason for removal, although it's not very clear.\r\n\r\nWe can obviously work around that by forking go-swagger and applying fixes on top of the old code, but I believe there's a better way.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nReinstate the removed functionality.\r\n\r\nTo the best of my understanding, the biggest problem here is to avoid user confusion between `--skip-validation` and `--skip-validator`. There are many ways to solve it; I propose to:\r\n * add `--generate` option, accepting a `string:bool` type, for example: `--generate struct:false --generate validator:false`.\r\n* for backward compatibility, add the following hidden options\r\n`--skip-struct` (equivalent of `--generate struct:false`)\r\n`--skip-handler`\r\n`--skip-parameters`\r\n`--skip-responses`\r\n`--skip-url-builder`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2077/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/650516235","html_url":"https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2285#issuecomment-650516235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2285","id":650516235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MDUxNjIzNQ==","user":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-27T07:40:11Z","updated_at":"2020-06-27T07:40:11Z","body":"@YanzhaoLi
