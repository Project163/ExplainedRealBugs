All the fixes to cycles entailed removing unused import added by the code generator. Unfortunately, in the real code there are 121 endpoints and each has 3 files that need to be touched up, so manually modifying the files is not sustainable. Any suggestions on automated tooling to cleanup after the swagger generate server command?\r\n\r\nIn my Makefile I have added the following target.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  swagger-touchup:\r\n    # We run find -- goimports twice because of cycles.\r\n    find . -name \"*.go\" -exec goimports -w {} \\; && \\\r\n      find . -name \"*.go\" -exec goimports -w {} \\; && \\\r\n      find . -name \"*.go\" -exec gofmt -w {} \\; && \\\r\n      find . -name \"*.go\" -exec gofmt -w {} \\;\r\n  .PHONY: swagger-touchup\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems remove most of the cycles which are just unused imports anyways. Seems like to me we are just blindly adding imports. Unfortunately, server.go and main.go still have unused imports. It would be nice if go-swagger validated auto generated code and fixed issues before the program exited.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/1340990139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mehoggan","id":904966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDk2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/904966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan","html_url":"https://github.com/mehoggan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/comments/1341087775","html_url":"https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2866#issuecomment-1341087775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2866","id":1341087775,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAZfQX85P72Af","user":{"login":"mehoggan","id":904966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDk2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/904966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan","html_url":"https://github.com/mehoggan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehoggan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-07T14:57:01Z","updated_at":"2022-12-07T14:57:01Z","body":"Updated `Makefile` now reads:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  swagger-touchup:\r\n    # We run find -- goimports twice because of cycles.\r\n    $(eval go_path := git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/restapi)\r\n    $(eval go_path := $(go_path)/operations)\r\n    find . -name \"*.go\" -exec goimports -w {} \\; && \\\r\n      find . -name \"*.go\" -exec goimports -w {} \\; && \\\r\n      find . -name \"*.go\" -exec gofmt -w {} \\; && \\\r\n      find . -name \"*.go\" -exec gofmt -w {} \\; && \\\r\n      sed -i .bak '\\|$(go_path)/v1|d' restapi/server.go && \\\r\n      sed -i .bak '\\|$(go_path)/v3|d' restapi/server.go && \\\r\n      sed -i .bak '\\|$(go_path)/v1|d' cmd/go-planting-server/main.go && \\\r\n      sed -i .bak '\\|$(go_path)/v3|d' cmd/go-planting-server/main.go && \\\r\n      find . -name \"*.bak\" -exec rm {} \\;\r\n  .PHONY: swagger-touchup\r\n```\r\nThis gets the server to build.
