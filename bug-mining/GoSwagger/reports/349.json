After a preliminary review of the spec, it is not seen why the resulting `go` code has cycles in them.\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\n2.0\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nFirst some background. I am porting an old `clojure` application over to `golang`. I took the swagger.json from that service and then did the following to transform it to an OpenAPI v2.0 specification. the `swagger.json` was tranformed to YAML using\r\nthe following online [tool](http://editor.swagger.io/#/). Further processing was required because the `swagger.io` tool produced an OpenAPI v3.0 spec. To convert the OpenAPI v3.0 spec to a OpenAPI v2.0 (swagger) spec, an account was created at [APIMATIC](https://www.apimatic.io/dashboard) and the spec was \"transformed\" using the `Transform API` button.\r\n\r\nAfter the OpenAPI v2.0 (swagger) spec was generated and validated. The following command was run:\r\n```\r\nswagger generate server -A go-planting -f swagger.yml\r\n```\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the following commands were run to build the server:\r\n```\r\ngo mod tidy && \\\r\n   cd cmd/go-planting-server && \\\r\n   go build\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis resulted in a build error. Somehow the spec or swagger generates `go` code with cycles in them. The errors are as follows:\r\n```\r\npackage git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/cmd/go-planting-server\r\n\timports git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/restapi\r\n\timports git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/restapi/operations\r\n\timports git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/restapi/operations/core\r\n\timports git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/restapi/operations/v1\r\n\timports git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/restapi/operations/v1: import cycle not allowed\r\npackage git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/cmd/go-planting-server\r\n\timports git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/restapi\r\n\timports git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/restapi/operations\r\n\timports git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/restapi/operations/core\r\n\timports git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/restapi/operations/v1\r\n\timports git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/restapi/operations/v3\r\n\timports git.tcc.li/climate/pipelines/reg/go-planting/restapi/operations/v3: import cycle not allowed\r\n```\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version: 0.30.3 \r\ngo version: 1.18.3\r\nOS: macOS Monterey Version 12.6\r\n\r\n[swagger.yml.zip](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/files/10168042/swagger.yml.zip)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"fredbi","id":14262513,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjYyNTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14262513?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi","html_url":"https://github.com/fredbi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredbi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2866/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
