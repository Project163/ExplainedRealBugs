issue is not specific to ` MinItems`: all validations are affected. It affects models that represent arrays or maps.\r\nFor all those models, the path is empty. Path is used effectively for parameters, responses and headers and for properties in `struct`s that represent objects.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the above expectation is difficult to meet without breaking a lot of the logic in how that path reported in validations errors is constructed.\r\n\r\nHere is a proposal (see forthcoming PR): expose an option to build models (e.g. `--rooted-error-path`   that enables the above expectation. Specifically for arrays and maps, we can replace the empty path by the name of the type.\r\n\r\nHere how it would look like in your example (I've added another validation to show that this is not limited to `minItems` ):\r\n```go \r\n// BlahArray The array of blah numbers\r\n//\r\n// swagger:model BlahArray\r\ntype BlahArray []int64\r\n\r\n// Validate validates this blah array\r\nfunc (m BlahArray) Validate(formats strfmt.Registry) error {\r\n        var res []error\r\n\r\n        iBlahArraySize := int64(len(m))\r\n\r\n        if err := validate.MinItems(\"[BlahArray]\", \"body\", iBlahArraySize, 1); err != nil {\r\n                return err\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if err := validate.UniqueItems(\"[BlahArray]\", \"body\", m); err != nil {\r\n                return err\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if len(res) > 0 {\r\n                return errors.CompositeValidationError(res...)\r\n        }\r\n        return nil\r\n}\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nSimilarly for maps:\r\nwith \r\n````yaml\r\nBlahMap:\r\n    description: this is a map[string]string\r\n    type: object\r\n    additionalProperties:\r\n      type: string\r\n    maxProperties: 10\r\n````\r\none may get:\r\n```go\r\n// BlahMap this is a map[string]string\r\n//\r\n// swagger:model BlahMap\r\ntype BlahMap map[string]string\r\n\r\n// Validate validates this blah map\r\nfunc (m BlahMap) Validate(formats strfmt.Registry) error {\r\n        var res []error\r\n\r\n        nprops := len(m)\r\n\r\n        // maxProperties: 10\r\n        if nprops > 10 {\r\n                return errors.TooManyProperties(\"[BlahMap]\", \"body\", 10)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if len(res) > 0 {\r\n                return errors.CompositeValidationError(res...)\r\n        }\r\n        return
