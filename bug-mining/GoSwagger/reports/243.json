Problem statement\r\n\r\nSince go-openapi/loads adopted gob to deep clone specs (commit: https://github.com/go-openapi/loads/pull/19/commits/0d17535daa37578ec3b60494288bd3164cb9a36b), some regressions occurred on spec objects which have custom json marshalling.\r\n\r\nA first regression on \"$ref\" (bug: #1816) has been fixed with #1818.\r\n\r\nAnother one on \"security\" object has been found when analyzing #1817.\r\n\r\nWe need to add some more GobEncode/GobDecode in go-openapi/spec to ensure this optimization causes no more regression.\r\n\r\n## Swagger specification\r\nhttps://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/examples/generated/swagger.json\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nRegenerate examples, observe diff.\r\nObserve that:\r\n```yaml\r\nsecurity: \r\n  api_key: []\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes:\r\n```yaml\r\nsecurity: \r\n  api_key: null\r\n```\r\n## Environment\r\nswagger version:  current master\r\ngo version:
