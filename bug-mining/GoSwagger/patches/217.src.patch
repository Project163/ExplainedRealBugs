 ## Installation and environment
 
 ### What is the minimal go version required?
-Our general policy is that we support the two latest go versions.
+Our policy is to support the two latest versions of the go compiler.
 
 That being said, as of Dec. 2017, our CI engines currently run all tests on go 1.7, on Linux and Windows platforms.

+# Requirements to build generated code
+
+## First time with golang?
+
+Golang is a powerful and enticing language, but it may sometimes confuse first timers.
+
+Before engaging further with `go-swagger`, please take a while to get comfortable with golang basics 
+and conventions. That will save yourself much time and frustration.
+
+## Standard golang environment
+
+* version: we support the two latest versions of the go compiler
+* `GOPATH` environment variable set: all sources reside under `$GOPATH/src`
+* it is recommended, but not mandatory, to use the `dep` tool to manage dependencies
+(see [here](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/introduction.html))
+
+The target directory for your generated code _must_ be under GOPATH/src.
+
+## Getting dependencies
+
+Before generating code, you should make sure your target is going to properly resolve dependencies.
+
+> **NOTE**: generation makes use of the `goimports` tool and dependencies must be matched at code generation time.
+
+If your target is located under the `go-swagger` install directory (when installed from source), dependencies are directly
+provided by the `vendor` directory that ships with `go-swagger`.
+
+The following required dependencies may be fetched by using `go get`:
+
+- [`github.com/go-openapi/errors`](https://www.github.com/go-openapi/errors)
+- [`github.com/go-openapi/loads`](https://www.github.com/go-openapi/loads)
+- [`github.com/go-openapi/runtime`](https://www.github.com/go-openapi/runtime)
+- [`github.com/go-openapi/spec`](https://www.github.com/go-openapi/spec)
+- [`github.com/go-openapi/strfmt`](https://www.github.com/go-openapi/strfmt)
+- [`github.com/go-openapi/swag`](https://www.github.com/go-openapi/swag)
+- [`github.com/go-openapi/validate`](https://www.github.com/go-openapi/validate)
+
+You may also build a vendor directory in your planned target: a way to achieve that is to copy there an example from the
+`go-swagger/examples` repository then run `dep` - see [how to use dep here](https://github.com/golang/dep).
+This will produce `Gopkg.toml` and `Gopkg.lock` files and construct a vendor directory with all required dependencies
+(the ones above and all transitive dependencies). Another way is to proceed in two steps, first with `go get`, then generate code, 
+then build the vendor tree with `dep`.
+
+> **NOTE** : the code generation process ends with a message indicating the packages required for your generated code.
+
+
+### What are the dependencies required by the generated server?
+
+Additional packages required by the (default) generated server:
+
+- [`github.com/tylerb/graceful`](https://www.github.com/tylerb/graceful)
+
+And depending on your generation options, a command line flags handling package:
+
+- [`github.com/jessevdk/go-flags`](https://www.github.com/jessevdk/go-flags), or
+- [`github.com/spf13/pflags`](https://www.github.com/spf13/pflags)
+
+### What are the dependencies required by the generated client?
+
+Same as above, plus:
+
+- `golang.org/x/net/context`
+
+### What are the dependencies required by the generated models?
+
+The generated models package depends only on:
+
+- [`github.com/go-openapi/errors`](https://www.github.com/go-openapi/errors)
+- [`github.com/go-openapi/strfmt`](https://www.github.com/go-openapi/strfmt)
+- [`github.com/go-openapi/swag`](https://www.github.com/go-openapi/swag)
+- [`github.com/go-openapi/validate`](https://www.github.com/go-openapi/validate)
+
+### How about generating specs?
+
+The code that is scanned for spec generation _must_ resolve all its dependencies (i.e. must build).
