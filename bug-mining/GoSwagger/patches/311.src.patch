 ## Note to users migrating from older releases
 
-### Migrating from 0.24 to [master]
+### Migrating from 0.25 to [master]
+
+Changes in the behavior of the generated client regarding defaults in parameters and response headers:
+
+  * default values for parameters are no more hydrated by default and sent over the wire
+    (assuming the server uses defaults).
+  * the previous behavior (explicitly sending defaults over the wire) can be obtained
+    with the SetDefaults() and WithDefaults() parameter methods.
+  * the body parameter is not pre-hydrated with the default from it schema
+  * default values for response headers are hydrated when the header is not received
+    (previously, headers remained with their zero value)
+
+### Migrating from 0.24 to 0.25
 
 The options for `generate model --all-definitions` and `--skip-struct` are marked for deprecation.
