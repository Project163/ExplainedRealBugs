+If I have a swagger spec that expects
+
+{"foo": 123}
+
+and provide
+
+{"foo": 123, "blah": 345}
+
+it happily goes on about this way.
+
+Two questions:
+1. can I make it complain if extra stuff is included
+2. can I access these extra sections within the go code/handler?
+
+**Answer**: use `additionalProperties: false` or `additionalProperties: true` in your definition.

+### How to support generate type int?
+
+_Use-case_: generating `int` types
+
+> I need to use swagger to generate my modes in go code.
+> But I find I can hardly generate type `int`, always `int64`.
+> Since I need to keep back compatibility for my project, I can hardly change the type.
+> So in this case, does go-swagger meet this requirement?
+
+**Answer**:  int is not a good option to support when it comes to contracts.
+
+> Consider the following: you have an arm32 client on which int is int32, however your server is amd64.
+> At this stage it's perfectly valid for the server to return int32 max value + 1, this will cause the client to overflow.
+> So while go allows int as type I think for API contracts int is too ambiguous as definition leading to subtle but hard to debug failures.
+> Similarly other languages may choose to default to int32 type instead of int64 type regardless of platform.

+### HTTPS TLS Cipher Suites not supported by AWS Elastic LoadBalancer
+
+_Use-case_: AWS Elastic LoadBalancer forwards https requests to instances, and their security policy is 'ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08'.
+However, while running the server on https, the server keeps on logging
+
+`http: TLS handshake error from 192.168.X.X:XXXXX: tls: no cipher suite supported by both client and server.`
+
+If we remove the cipher suites on the generated code, it resolves the issue -
+
+```golang
+CipherSuites: []uint16{
+  tls.TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
+  tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
+  tls.TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
+  tls.TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
+},
+```
+
+The ELB security policy 'ELBSecurityPolicy-2016-08' does include these cipher suites, however all requests sent by the ELB are rejected by the server.
+
+**Answer**: you can generate the server with a different compatibility mode for the older generation of ciphers

+swagger generate server --compatibility-mode=intermediate

+> The "default" section must contain any "required" properties, which is counterintuitive because the "required" properties

+But I think the error message should not show even I just use `swagger generate model -f person.yaml` because
+"required" properties should always be provided explicitly and shouldn’t have defaults.
+
+**Answer:** Those defaults need to be put on the individual members.

+```
+
+**Answer:** the spec validation warns you about mixing up default with required.
+
+> If you override this validation (with `swagger generate model --skip-validation`), the model generator would override the
+> required clause, and use the default.
+
+**Would --skip-validation skip any other validations?**
+
+**Answer:** Yes. `--skip-validation` skips the call to `swagger validate {spec}`, which is normally carried on before generation.
+
+For some use cases, we have to, since `go-swagger` supports constructs that are not stricly swagger-compliant.
+This one is an example: some override silently take place here at generation time.

+### Duplicate operationId error
+_Use-Case_:  my spec indicates duplicate operationIds but for separate endpoints.
+When generating a server and there are multiple endpoints, the `operations` directory in `restapi`
+contains subdirectories for each of those endpoints.
+
+Example:
+
+```yaml
+paths:
+  '/users/{id}':
+    parameters:
+      - name: id
+        in: path
+        required: true
+        type: string
+    get:
+      operationId: getById
+      summary: Get User By ID
+      tags:
+        - Users
+      responses:
+        '200':
+          description: ''
+          schema:
+            $ref: '#/definitions/user-output'
+  '/pets/{id}':
+    parameters:
+      - name: id
+        in: path
+        required: true
+        type: string
+    get:
+      operationId: getById
+      summary: Get Pet By ID
+      tags:
+        - Pets
+      responses:
+        '200':
+          description: ''
+          schema:
+            $ref: '#/definitions/pet-output'
+```
+
+I am expecting a generated structure like so:
+```
+└── restapi
+    ...
+    ├── operations
+    │   ├── pets
+    │   │   ├── ...
+    │   ├── users
+    │   │   ├── ...
+    │   └── ...
+```
+
+However, instead of generating the server I get this error: `"getById" is defined 2 times`
+
+Is it possible to bypass this validation error IF the operation ids will go into separate directories?
+
+**Answer:** operationId is always globally unique per swagger 2.0 specification. The id MUST be unique among all operations described in the API.
+
+https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#operationObject
+
+> Unique string used to identify the operation. The id MUST be unique among all operations described in the API.
+> Tools and libraries MAY use the operationId to uniquely identify an operation,
+> therefore, it is recommended to follow common programming naming conventions.
