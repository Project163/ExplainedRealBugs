 2. Generally, contributors should squash their commits (use `git rebase -i master`)
 3. Provide sufficient test coverage with changes
 4. Do not bring in uncontrolled dependencies, including from fixtures or examples
-Adding dependencies is possible with a vendor update (`dep ensure -update`)
 5. Use the `fixes #xxx` github feature in PR to automate issue closing
 6. Sign-off commits with `git commit -s`. PGP-signed commits with verified signatures are not mandatory (but much appreciated)
+7. Use the "draft PR" github feature to draft some work and exercise it against our CI before review

 ### Vendoring
 
-`go-swagger/go-swagger` repo comes with a vendor directory. This is because
-we release binary distributions (docker, debian...).
-
-The `go-openapi` packages are **not** vendored.
-
-Vendoring is managed using the current _official_ `dep` tool.
-Configuration is in `Gopkg.toml`.
-
-Run `dep ensure -update` to update dependencies. Please do not cherry-pick
-updates manually.

-> **NOTE**: since there are many dependencies, running an update may update
-> many things.
-> We prefer to get vendor updates as separate commits with changes to vendor only.

-This happens for instance whenever you want to test the full integration in `go-swagger` of an unmerged PR
-in one of the `go-openapi` repos.
-
-With `go-swagger` (vendored):
-- prepare a "WIP" PR with a temporary vendor update commit
-- this vendor update temporarily alters the `branch` and `source` in `Gopkg.toml`
-to get the proper version of the required dependency from the unmerged branch (e.g. from your fork)
-
-With `go-openapi` (non vendored):
-- for your "WIP" PR, temporarily alter the CI config script (e.g. `.travis.yml`) and
-replace the `go get` requirements to build your CI with the adequate `git clone`
-pointing to the required branches
+The whole `go-openapi` and `go-swagger` has adopted go modules and no more use vendoring.
