+  title: Instagram API
+  description: >
+    The first version of the Instagram API is an exciting step forward towards
+
+    making it easier for users to have open access to their data. We created it
+
+    so that you can surface the amazing content Instagram users share every
+
+    second, in fun and innovative ways.
+
+
+
+    Build something great!
+
+
+
+    Once you've
+
+    [registered your client](http://instagram.com/developer/register/) it's easy
+
+    to start requesting data from Instagram.
+
+
+
+    All endpoints are only accessible via https and are located at
+
+    `api.instagram.com`. For instance: you can grab the most popular photos at
+
+    the moment by accessing the following URL with your client ID
+
+    (replace CLIENT-ID with your own):
+
+    ```
+
+      https://api.instagram.com/v1/media/popular?client_id=CLIENT-ID
+
+    ```
+
+    You're best off using an access_token for the authenticated user for each
+
+    endpoint, though many endpoints don't require it.
+
+    In some cases an access_token will give you more access to information, and
+
+    in all cases, it means that you are operating under a per-access_token limit
+
+    vs. the same limit for your single client_id.
+
+
+
+
+
+    ## Limits
+
+    Be nice. If you're sending too many requests too quickly, we'll send back a
+
+    `503` error code (server unavailable).
+
+    You are limited to 5000 requests per hour per `access_token` or `client_id`
+
+    overall. Practically, this means you should (when possible) authenticate
+
+    users so that limits are well outside the reach of a given user.
+
+
+
+    ## Deleting Objects
+
+    We do our best to have all our URLs be
+
+    [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).
+
+    Every endpoint (URL) may support one of four different http verbs. GET
+
+    requests fetch information about an object, POST requests create objects,
+
+    PUT requests update objects, and finally DELETE requests will delete
+
+    objects.
+
+
+
+    Since many old browsers don't support PUT or DELETE, we've made it easy to
+
+    fake PUTs and DELETEs. All you have to do is do a POST with _method=PUT or
+
+    _method=DELETE as a parameter and we will treat it as if you used PUT or
+
+    DELETE respectively.
+
+
+
+    ## Structure
+
+
+
+    ### The Envelope
+
+    Every response is contained by an envelope. That is, each response has a
+
+    predictable set of keys with which you can expect to interact:
+
+    ```json
+
+    {
+
+        "meta": {
+
+            "code": 200
+
+        },
+
+        "data": {
+
+            ...
+
+        },
+
+        "pagination": {
+
+            "next_url": "...",
+
+            "next_max_id": "13872296"
+
+        }
+
+    }
+
+    ```
+
+
+
+    #### META
+
+    The meta key is used to communicate extra information about the response to
+
+    the developer. If all goes well, you'll only ever see a code key with value
+
+    200. However, sometimes things go wrong, and in that case you might see a
+
+    response like:
+
+    ```json
+
+    {
+
+        "meta": {
+
+            "error_type": "OAuthException",
+
+            "code": 400,
+
+            "error_message": "..."
+
+        }
+
+    }
+
+    ```
+
+
+
+    #### DATA
+
+    The data key is the meat of the response. It may be a list or dictionary,
+
+    but either way this is where you'll find the data you requested.
+
+    #### PAGINATION
+
+    Sometimes you just can't get enough. For this reason, we've provided a
+
+    convenient way to access more data in any request for sequential data.
+
+    Simply call the url in the next_url parameter and we'll respond with the
+
+    next set of data.
+
+    ```json
+
+    {
+
+        ...
+
+        "pagination": {
+
+            "next_url":
+    "https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/puppy/media/recent?access_token=fb2e77d.47a0479900504cb3ab4a1f626d174d2d&max_id=13872296",
+
+            "next_max_id": "13872296"
+
+        }
+
+    }
+
+    ```
+
+    On views where pagination is present, we also support the "count" parameter.
+
+    Simply set this to the number of items you'd like to receive. Note that the
+
+    default values should be fine for most applications - but if you decide to
+
+    increase this number there is a maximum value defined on each endpoint.
+
+
+
+    ### JSONP
+
+    If you're writing an AJAX application, and you'd like to wrap our response
+
+    with a callback, all you have to do is specify a callback parameter with
+
+    any API call:
+
+    ```
+
+    https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/coffee/media/recent?access_token=fb2e77d.47a0479900504cb3ab4a1f626d174d2d&callback=callbackFunction
+
+    ```
+
+    Would respond with:
+
+    ```js
+
+    callbackFunction({
+
+        ...
+
+    });
+
+    ```

+      At this time, uploading via the API is not possible. We made a conscious
+
+      choice not to add this for the following reasons:
+
+
+
+      * Instagram is about your life on the go – we hope to encourage photos
+
+        from within the app.
+
+      * We want to fight spam & low quality photos. Once we allow uploading
+
+        from other sources, it's harder to control what comes into the Instagram
+
+        ecosystem. All this being said, we're working on ways to ensure users
+
+        have a consistent and high-quality experience on our platform.
