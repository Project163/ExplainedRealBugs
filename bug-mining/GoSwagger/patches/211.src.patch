+### How to serve Swagger UI from a preexisting web app?
+_Use-Case_: Does go-swagger provide an `http.HandlerFunc` or other easy method for serving Swagger UI from a prexisting web app? 
+I want my web app to expose `/swagger-ui`, without using code generation, and without hosting a separate server.
+
+**Answer**: there are a few ways you can serve a UI.
+
+Use the middleware provided in the go-openapi/runtime package: https://github.com/go-openapi/runtime/blob/master/middleware/redoc.go

+
+### How to use swagger-ui cors?
+
+**Answer**: you can add a cors middleware.
+
+Like: https://github.com/rs/cors
+
+[Documentation on how to customize middleware](use/middleware.md)
+
+Working example (in `configure_name.go`):
+
+```golang
+import "github.com/rs/cors"
+
+func setupGlobalMiddleware(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {
+    handleCORS := cors.Default().Handler
+    return handleCORS(handler)
+}
+```
+
+Originally from issue [#481](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/481).
+
+### How to serve my UI files?
+_Use-Case_: I generated server code using go-swagger with my swagger.yaml file like below.
+```bash
+$ swagger generate server --exclude-main -A myapp -t gen -f ./swagger.yaml
+```
+And I want to add new handler to serve my own UI files. 
+In this case, is middleware only solution to serve UI files? Or can I add new handler to serve files without middleware?
+```go
+// Handler example which I want to add to swagger server
+func pastaWorkspacePage(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
+	http.ServeFile(w, r, "./static/workspace.html")
+}
+```
+
+I solved the problem using middleware.
+```go
+func FileServerMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
+	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
+		if strings.HasPrefix(r.URL.Path, "/api") {
+			next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
+		} else {
+			http.FileServer(http.Dir("./static")).ServeHTTP(w, r)
+		}
+	})
+}
+```
+But I'm not sure it is the best solution.
+
+**Hint:** more info on using middlewares is found here: https://goswagger.io/use/middleware.html
+That page also contains a link to a good explanation on how to create net/http middlewares.
+
+> An implementation example is provided by the go-swagger serve UI command. It constructs a server with a redoc middleware:
+> https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/f552963ac0dfdec0450f6749aeeeeb2d31cd5544/cmd/swagger/commands/serve.go#L35.
+
+Besides, every swagger generated server comes with the redoc UI baked in at `/{basepath}/docs`

 ## Model generation
 
+### Custom validation
+_Use-Case_: is it possible to write own validation for custom types ? If it is, can someone give me example ?
+
+>For example! 
+>There is bookstore, with info about books: author, title, price. 
+> And we want, that books from some author will not cost more the some price.
+> So I want write function ValidateBookCustom() like:
+```golang
+if book.author == "Some author" {
+    if book.price > 1000 {
+       return false
+   }
+    else return true
+}
+```
+
+> And I want to use this function.
+
+**Answer**: there are several ways to achieve that.
+- reusing customized models
+- reusing custom go types
+- customizing code generation
+
+You should know that models may be generated independently from server, then reused when generating a new server.
+
+You might build on that: generating a first model, customizing the validation code, then reusing this model (possibly with some others) in your servers.
+
+Another way is to use the `x-go-type extension`, to replace type generation with a custom type.
+
+There is the opportunity to get go-swagger to reuse a predefined type to satisfy the definition in the swagger spec.
+Imported package and type alias may be specified as options, as shown in this example: 
+https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/fixtures/codegen/existing-model.yml#L84-L88
+
+That example reuses a type provided by a library with a package alias and type name. The code generator will respect this.
+
+You might use both, preparing a customized model from an initially generated structure, then reusing type custom type in other declarations by hinting the generator with x-go-type.
+
+Further, for repetitive customization, you might be willing to customize the generator's templates. Like in [here](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/generator/templates/schemavalidator.gotmpl)
+for models, or in [here](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/generator/templates/server/parameter.gotmpl) for inline parameters.
+
+Originally from issues [#997](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/997) and [#1334](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/1334)

 ### Non-required or nullable property?
 _Use-Case_: when a definition has a property N, if N is a number and is not required,
 the corresponding generated model has the struct flag `omitempty` for N.
