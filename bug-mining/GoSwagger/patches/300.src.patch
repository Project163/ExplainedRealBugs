 The generator makes every effort to keep the go code readable, idiomatic and commented: models may thus be manually customized or extended.
 Such customized types may be later on reused in other specs, using the `x-go-type` extension.
 
-##### Using custom types
-
-NOTE: what follows only applies to _schema_ models, not simple types used a query parameters or headers.
-
-You can bind models to external type definitions. The latter may have been generated models or bespoke types.
-
-This is done with the `x-go-type` extension.
-
-Examples:
-
-This example replaces all references to `myModel` by `github.com/example/models/MyCustomModel`
-```yaml
-definitions:
-  myModel:
-    type: object
-    x-go-type:
-      type: MyCustomModel
-      import:
-        package: github.com/example/models
-```
-
-Note that the external model must implement the `github.com/go-openapi/runtime.Validatable` interface: it must know how to validate a schema.
-No model is generated for this definition.
-
-Sometimes, it is impractical to impose this constraint on the external type. You can then use the "embedded" option to create an embedded type
-based on the external model.
-
-Example:
-```yaml
-definitions:
-  Time:
-    type: string
-    format: date-time         # <- documentary only (external types takes over). This has no impact on generation.
-    x-go-type:
-      type: Time
-      import:
-        package: time
-      embedded: true
-```
-
-This example generates a type in the package model with a `Validate` method like this:
-
-```go
-import (
-	"time"
-
-	"github.com/go-openapi/runtime"
-	"github.com/go-openapi/strfmt"
-	"github.com/go-openapi/swag"
-)
-
-// Time time
-//
-// swagger:model Time
-type Time struct {
-	time.Time
-}
-
-func (m Time) Validate(formats strfmt.Registry) error {
-	var f interface{} = m.Time
-	if v, ok := f.(runtime.Validatable); ok {
-		return v.Validate(formats)
-	}
-	return nil
-}
-```
-
-The generated `Validate` method uses any existing `Validate` method or just returns `nil` (i.e. data is valid).
-
-NOTE: at the moment, we do not support the `format` specification over the embedded type. Format will be documentary only in that case.
-
-Other examples:
-```yaml 
-  Raw:
-    x-go-type:
-      type: RawMessage
-      import:
-        package: encoding/json
-      hints:
-        kind: primitive
-      embedded: true
-```
-```go 
-type Raw struct {
-	json.RawMessage
-}
-
-func (m Raw) Validate(formats strfmt.Registry) error {
-	var f interface{} = m.RawMessage
-	if v, ok := f.(runtime.Validatable); ok {
-		return v.Validate(formats)
-	}
-	return nil
-}
-```
-
-You can embed types as pointers just the same.
-
-Example:
-```yaml
-definitions:
-  Time:
-    type: string
-    x-go-type:
-      type: Time
-      import:
-        package: time
-      hints:
-        nullable: true  # <- nullable here refers to the nullability of the embedded external type 
-      embedded: true
-```
-
-```go
-type Time struct {
-	*time.Time
-}
-```
-
-
-Using external types is powerful, but normally you still have to describe your type in the specification. That is expected,
-since this is how you document your API.
-
-If you don't (that is the type referred to doesn't correspond to the type in the spec), then the generator may fail to produce correct code,
-because it simply has no way to infer what _kind_ of object is being referred to.
-
-To solve this kind of problem, you may hint the generator to produce a correct usage of the external types, even though the specification
-doesn't reflect the correct nature of the object.
-
-Example:
-```yaml 
-definitions:
-  Error:
-    type: object
-
-  Hotspot:
-    x-go-type:
-      type: Hotspot
-      import:
-        package: github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/fixtures/enhancements/2224/external
-      hints:
-        kind: object
-    x-nullable: true
-```
-In this example, the `Hotspot` schema is empty in the specification. The generator therefore can only guess that this is some `interface{}` type.
-Now thanks to the hint `kind: object`, we instruct the generator to expect an object so as to correctly reference this object.
-
-At the moment, valid hints are: ` map|object|array|interface|primitive|tuple|stream`.

+##### External types
+
+External types refer to custom type definitions, short-circuiting the use of generated models.
+
+This is helpful for use-cases when custom marshaling or validation is needed.
+
+Models may also be generated once, customized manually, then reused in spec as external types.
+
+The extension annotation to declare an external type is `x-go-type`.
+
+A complete example is provided [here](../../../examples/external-types/swagger-external.yaml)
+to illustrate the different capabilities to inject custom types.
+
+
+Examples:
+
+External types are typically used in top-level model definitions, like so:
+
+```yaml
+definitions:
+  myType:
+    type: object
+    x-go-type:
+      type: MyExternalType                          # <- abide by go conventions! The type must be exported
+      import:
+        package: github.com/example/models/custom     # <- use fully qualified package names
+```
+
+Such definitions do not produce any generated model.
+
+References in the generated code to this type will produce code like this:
+
+```go
+custom.MyExternalType
+```
+
+If no package is provided, it defaults to the models package indicated for codegen:
+```yaml
+definitions:
+  generatedType:
+    type: array
+    items:
+      $ref: '#/definitions/myType'
+
+  myType:
+    type: object
+    x-go-type:
+      type: MyExternalType
+```
+
+```sh
+swagger generate models --model-package custom --target ./codegen
+
+ls ./codegen/custom   # <- myType is NOT GENERATED
+cat ./codegen/custom/generated_type.go
+```
+
+```go
+package custom
+
+type GeneratedType []MyType
+```
+
+External types may also be injected at lower schema levels:
+
+```yaml
+definitions:
+  MyType:
+    type: array
+    items:
+      type: string
+      x-go-type:
+        type: MyExternalString
+        import:
+          package: github.com/example/models/custom
+```
+or:
+```yaml
+  MyObject:
+    type: object
+    properties:
+      p1:
+        x-go-type:
+          type: RawMessage
+          import:
+            package: encoding/json
+          hints:
+            kind: interface
+```
+
+This also works for inlined types defined at the operation level:
+
+```yaml
+  parameters:
+  - in: body
+    name: corpus
+    schema:
+      type: object
+      x-go-type:
+        type: MyExternalStruct
+        import:
+          package: github.com/example/models/custom
+```
+
+> **NOTE**: when defining inline arrays or maps, you should know that the external type is
+> not considered nullable by default.
+>
+> Therefore, unless you explicitly hint the generator to consider it nullable, you'll
+> get constructs such as `[]external.MyType` or `map[string]external.MyType` instead of `[]*external.MyType`
+> and `map[string]*external.MyType` respectively. You can use the `nullable` hint or the `x-nullable` extension
+> to control this behavior.
+
+###### Known limitations
+
+* External types only apply to schema objects. Simple swagger types
+  used in operations for query or path parameters or for response headers
+  cannot be externalized at this moment.
+
+* Inlined external types cannot be declared inside polymorphic types (discriminated types).
+
+* Inlined external types cannot be declared as embedded. Only top-level definitions are supported.
+
+
+###### External package aliasing
+
+
+The following example replaces all references to `myModel` by `github.com/example/models/MyCustomModel`.
+
+Example:
+
+```yaml
+definitions:
+  myModel:
+    type: object
+    x-go-type:
+      type: MyCustomModel
+      import:
+        package: github.com/example/models
+```
+
+Note that the external model must implement the `github.com/go-openapi/runtime.Validatable` interface: it must know how to validate a schema.
+No model is generated for this definition.
+
+External packages may be imported with an alias, like so:
+
+```yaml
+  parameters:
+    in: body
+    schema:
+      type: object
+      x-go-type:
+        type: MyExternalStruct
+        import:
+          package: github.com/example/models/custom
+          alias: fred
+```
+
+Imports will look like so:
+```go
+import (
+  fred "github.com/example/models/custom"
+)
+...
+```
+
+Some deconfliction with other known import is applied automatically. Automatic deconfliction is not perfect, though.
+
+For example:
+```yaml
+  MyObject:
+    type: object
+    properties:
+      p1:
+        x-go-type:
+          type: RawMessage
+          import:
+            package: encoding/json
+          hints:
+            kind: interface
+```
+
+```go
+import (
+  jsonext "encoding/json"
+)
+```
+
+
+###### Embedding external types
+
+Sometimes, it is impractical to impose the constraint that the external type has a validation method.
+You can then use the "embedded" option to create an embedded type based on the external model, and wraps the Validate
+method.
+
+Example:
+```yaml
+definitions:
+  Time:
+    type: string
+    format: date-time         # <- documentary only (external types takes over). This has no impact on generation.
+    x-go-type:
+      type: Time
+      import:
+        package: time
+      embedded: true
+```
+
+This example generates a wrapper type in the package model with a `Validate` method like this:
+
+```go
+import (
+	timeext "time"
+
+	"github.com/go-openapi/runtime"
+	"github.com/go-openapi/strfmt"
+	"github.com/go-openapi/swag"
+)
+
+// Time time
+//
+// swagger:model Time
+type Time struct {
+	timeext.Time
+}
+
+func (m Time) Validate(formats strfmt.Registry) error {
+	var f interface{} = m.Time
+	if v, ok := f.(runtime.Validatable); ok {
+		return v.Validate(formats)
+	}
+	return nil
+}
+```
+
+The generated `Validate` method uses any existing `Validate` method or just returns `nil` (i.e. data is valid).
+
+> **NOTE**: at the moment, we do not support the `format` specification over the embedded type. Format will be documentary only in that case.
+
+Other examples:
+```yaml
+  Raw:
+    x-go-type:
+      type: RawMessage
+      import:
+        package: encoding/json
+      hints:
+        kind: primitive
+      embedded: true
+```
+```go
+import (
+ ...
+ jsonext "encoding/json"
+ ...
+)
+
+type Raw struct {
+	jsonext.RawMessage
+}
+
+func (m Raw) Validate(formats strfmt.Registry) error {
+	var f interface{} = m.RawMessage
+	if v, ok := f.(runtime.Validatable); ok {
+		return v.Validate(formats)
+	}
+	return nil
+}
+```
+
+You can embed types as pointers just the same.
+
+Example:
+```yaml
+definitions:
+  Time:
+    type: string
+    x-go-type:
+      type: Time
+      import:
+        package: time
+      hints:
+        nullable: true  # <- nullable here refers to the nullability of the embedded external type
+      embedded: true
+```
+
+```go
+type Time struct {
+	*time.Time
+}
+```
+
+
+Using external types is powerful, but normally you still have to describe your type in the specification. That is expected,
+since this is how you document your API.
+
+If you don't (that is the type referred to doesn't correspond to the type in the spec), then the generator may fail to produce correct code,
+because it simply has no way to infer what _kind_ of object is being referred to.
+
+To solve this kind of problem, you may hint the generator to produce a correct usage of the external types, even though the specification
+doesn't reflect the correct nature of the object.
+
+Example:
+```yaml
+definitions:
+  Error:
+    type: object
+
+  Hotspot:
+    x-go-type:
+      type: Hotspot
+      import:
+        package: github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/fixtures/enhancements/2224/external
+      hints:
+        kind: object
+    x-nullable: true
+```
+In this example, the `Hotspot` schema is empty in the specification. The generator therefore can only guess that this is some `interface{}` type.
+Now thanks to the hint `kind: object`, we instruct the generator to expect an object so as to correctly reference this object.
+
+
+###### Validation of external types
+
+By default, the generator assumes that external types can be validated and will generate code that calls the "Validate"
+method of the type.
+
+This can be disabled  by providing an explicit hint:
+```yaml
+  MyObject:
+    type: object
+    properties:
+      p1:
+        x-go-type:
+          type: RawMessage
+          import:
+            package: encoding/json
+          hints:
+            noValidation: true
+```
+
+External types with an hint type "interface" or "stream" do not call validations.
+
+Embedded types use type assertion to dynamically determine if the external type implements the `runtime.Validatable` interface.
+
+
+###### External type hints
+
+The generator does not attempt to introspect external types. They may even not exist at generation time.
+
+Therefore, the generator has no idea of whether it is safe to generate pointers to the external type.
+
+By default, external types are considered non nullable. This can be altered with the nullable hint or
+by hinting a type that is considered nullable (such as "object").
+
+Supported hints:
+```yaml
+        x-go-type:
+          type: {external type name (exported symbol, without package qualifier)}
+          import:
+            package: {fully qualified package name - defaults to the target models defined by the --model-package flag}
+          hints:
+            kind: {map|object|array|interface|primitive|tuple|stream}
+            noValidation: true|false  # <- skips validation: defaults to true for embedded types, defaults to false for non-embedded, always false for kinds interface and stream
+            nullable: true|false      # <- default to true for kinds object,primitive and tuple
+          embedded: true|false        # <- defaults to false, generates a struct that wraps the external type
+```
+
+###### Caveats with imports
+
+At this moment, external packages and aliases are deconflicted against other known imports and variables.
+
+Example:
+```yaml
+  MyObject:
+    type: object
+    properties:
+      p1:
+        x-go-type:
+          type: RawMessage
+          import:
+            package: encoding/json
+          hints:
+            kind: interface
+```
+
+will generate an import deconflicted against the standard lib import:
+```go
+import(
+    ...
+    jsonext "encoding/json"
+    ...
+    )
+```
+
+###### External package aliasing
+
+External packages may be imported with an alias, like so:
+
+```yaml
+  parameters:
+    in: body
+    schema:
+      type: object
+      x-go-type:

+        import:

+```
+
+Imports will look like so:
+```go

+  fred "github.com/example/models/custom"
+)

+

+Package aliases may still conflict with packages produces by operation tags or other external imports.
+
+In such cases, modify the type alias under `x-go-type` to resolve the conflict manually.

+# External types examples
+
+The sample specification provided here demonstrates how to bind your generated API
+with some externally defined types for schemas.
+
+This [swagger specification](./example-external-types.yaml) illustrates the following use cases:
+
+1. refer to an external type imported from some external package, as its own definition
+2. refer to an external type imported from some external package, as part of another type (object, slice, map or tuple)
+3. refer to an external type imported from the default location of models (i.e. besides generated models)
+4. embed external type to add the Validatable interface.
+5. use hints in annotations to solve nullable/struct vs interface issues 
+6. use hints in annotations to skip the validation of external types
+
+> NOTE: due to the addition of the "additionalItems" clause to illustrate tuples, the spec is not formally
+> valid against the swagger 2.0 schema.

+
+    Notice that x-go-type works for schemas and is not supported for simple swagger types,

+  MyInterfaceObject:
+    description: |
+      This object demonstrates several ways to refer to an external interface.
+
+      The generated code behaves as it is an interface{}: no pointers are generated, and no valication
+      is required.
+
+    type: object
+    required: [ iface2, iface3 ]
+    properties:
+      iface1:
+        $ref: '#/definitions/MyInterface'
+      iface2:
+        description: |
+          Demonstrates the impact of the "interface" hint: no validation is called on iface2,
+          and no pointer is generated in spite of the "required" directive.
+
+          The generated object validation checks for the "required" directive.
+
+          Without the hint, the generator assumes a Validatable object, with pointer, which may
+          not build, depending on how the external type is defined.
+
+        x-go-type:
+          type: MyAlternateInterface

+
+      iface3:
+        description: |
+          Demonstrates the impact of the "noValidation" hint.
+
+          Notice how we avoid the generation of a pointer on the required json.RawMessage (which is a []byte)
+          with the "nullable" hint.
+
+          Notice that the "json" package is automatically deconflicted from other standard imports with a distinct alias.
+

+  description: |
+    This sample specification exercises external types, with both x-go-type in definitions and inlined.
+
+    It demonstrates how to use the x-go-type extension to plug external type definitions in the generated code,
+    for models (e.g. for properties, arrays or maps) or operations.
+
+    Notice that x-go-type works for schemas and is not supported for simple swagger types,
+    used for response headers and query & path parameters.
