So if the business definition of \"Debug is enabled\" changes, we'll have to change it only once.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"dgsb","id":5495748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5495748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb","html_url":"https://github.com/dgsb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sirupsen/logrus/issues/761/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sirupsen/logrus/issues/761/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
