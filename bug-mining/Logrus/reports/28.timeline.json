denial of service vulnerability in logrus.Writer() that could be triggered by logging text longer than 64kb without newlines. Previously, the bufio.Scanner used by Writer() would hang indefinitely when reading such text without newlines, causing the application to become unresponsive.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, I've modified the writerScanner() function to split input into chunks of up to 64kb using a custom split function. I've also set the scanner buffer size to the maximum token size using bufio.MaxScanTokeSize.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, logrus.Writer() now properly handles long, newline-free log messages without causing a denial of service.\r\n\r\nNote that the code has also been updated with more comments and that this fix is backwards-compatible.

766cfece introduced this bug by defining an incorrect split function. First it breaks the old behavior because it never splits at newlines now. Second, it causes a panic because it never tells the scanner to stop. See the bufio.ScanLines function, something like:\r\n```\r\nif atEOF && len(data) == 0 {\r\n\treturn 0, nil, nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\nis needed to do that.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes it by restoring the old behavior and calling bufio.ScanLines but also keep the 64KB check in place to avoid buffering for to long.\r\n\r\nTwo tests are added to ensure it is working as expected.\r\n\r\nFixes
