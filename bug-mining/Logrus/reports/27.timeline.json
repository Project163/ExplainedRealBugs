only had a quick glance, but would have to look up what the intended design was for this.\r\n\r\nHaving a look at the code, I see that the loglevel passed to `NewSyslogHook` is passed through to `syslog.Dial()`; https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/blob/a448f8228b920021d792e0767626068db5f0e38d/hooks/syslog/syslog.go#L23-L26\r\n\r\nWhere `syslog.Dial()` uses that level for each log message sent;\r\n\r\n> Each write to the returned writer sends a log message with the facility and severity (from priority) and tag\r\n\r\nHowever, the `Hook` itself advertises what log-levels it supports, which is \"all log levels\" in this case; https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/blob/a448f8228b920021d792e0767626068db5f0e38d/hooks/syslog/syslog.go#L53-L55\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the hook is added, that information is used to add a hook for each level it supports; https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/blob/a448f8228b920021d792e0767626068db5f0e38d/hooks.go#L16-L22\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich, when hooks are triggered, is used to fire the hook; https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus/blob/a448f8228b920021d792e0767626068db5f0e38d/hooks.go#L26-L34\r\n\r\nFrom the above, this either was by design (hooks always are tiggered for any level they support), or this was an oversight, and either the `LevelHooks.Add()` should only add hooks for levels above the logger's level, or `entry.firehooks()` should exclude it when firing;
