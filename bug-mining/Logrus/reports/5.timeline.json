there, just wondering what version of go this was an issue one? In golang 1.6 @rsterbin's original issue does not seem to happen:\n\n```\nERRO[0000] Logging without json                          error=Here is an error message\n{\"error\":\"Here is an error message\",\"level\":\"error\",\"msg\":\"Logging with json\",\"time\":\"2016-04-27T08:38:59-07:00\"}\n```\n\nThis is relevant because one thing we would like to do is return custom errors that implement MarshalJSON() as well as Error(), so that they can be treated like plain old `error` types but also be serialized intelligently in logrus messages.\n\nAt the moment this particular patch prevents this. If we have a type that implements Error() then the current logrus code seems to see it as an error type and call Error() on it, which stringify's it.\n\nExample:\n\n``` go\npackage main
