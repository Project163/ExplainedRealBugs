This is a very heavy import and with the introduction of Go modules will propagate to all projects using logrus.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I set logrus as a dependency to my Go module and run `go build` then the following build dependencies are added to my requirements:\r\n```\r\ngithub.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.0.6\r\ngolang.org/x/crypto v0.0.0-20180820150726-614d502a4dac // indirect\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when running `go mod tidy` to add all transitive dependencies ([including testing](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26913#issuecomment-411976222)), then I get these following additional lines:\r\n```\r\ngithub.com/davecgh/go-spew v1.1.1 // indirect\r\ngithub.com/fsnotify/fsnotify v1.4.7 // indirect\r\ngithub.com/golang/protobuf v1.2.0 // indirect\r\ngithub.com/hpcloud/tail v1.0.0 // indirect\r\ngithub.com/onsi/ginkgo v1.6.0 // indirect\r\ngithub.com/onsi/gomega v1.4.1 // indirect\r\ngithub.com/pmezard/go-difflib v1.0.0 // indirect\r\ngithub.com/stretchr/testify v1.2.2 // indirect\r\ngolang.org/x/net v0.0.0-20180821023952-922f4815f713 // indirect\r\ngolang.org/x/sync v0.0.0-20180314180146-1d60e4601c6f // indirect\r\ngolang.org/x/text v0.3.0 // indirect\r\ngopkg.in/airbrake/gobrake.v2 v2.0.9 // indirect\r\ngopkg.in/fsnotify.v1 v1.4.7 // indirect\r\ngopkg.in/gemnasium/logrus-airbrake-hook.v2 v2.1.2 // indirect\r\ngopkg.in/tomb.v1 v1.0.0-20141024135613-dd632973f1e7 // indirect\r\ngopkg.in/yaml.v2 v2.2.1 // indirect\r\n```\r\nAll because of `gopkg.in/gemnasium/logrus-airbrake-hook.v2`.\r\n\r\nI suggest using `github.com/sirupsen/logrus/hooks/syslog` in the example instead: it demonstrates using hooks just as well and does not result in any additional dependencies.","closed_by":{"login":"dgsb","id":5495748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTU3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5495748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb","html_url":"https://github.com/dgsb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgsb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sirupsen/logrus/issues/809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sirupsen/logrus/issues/809/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
