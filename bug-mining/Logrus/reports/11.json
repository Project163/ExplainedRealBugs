It outputs the expected key value pairs so that GCP logging automatically picks it up with the correct severity level.\r\n\r\nI saw that there are also plugins specifically for Stackdriver and Fluentd, but in this case no target hosts or credentials are necessary. Only the expected JSON format.\r\n\r\nIn case you would like to link it, that might be helpful to others.\r\nIf you think its already covered, just close this issue.\r\n\r\nThe formatter with an example can be found at https://github.com/joonix/log","closed_by":{"login":"dmathieu","id":9347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu","html_url":"https://github.com/dmathieu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmathieu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sirupsen/logrus/issues/520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sirupsen/logrus/issues/520/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
