What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nAligning an entity's coordinate-system to align towards a direction or towards a point.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nBevy already has:\r\n\r\n- [looking_at](http://dev-docs.bevyengine.org/bevy/transform/components/struct.Transform.html#method.looking_at)\r\n- [looking_to](http://dev-docs.bevyengine.org/bevy/transform/components/struct.Transform.html#method.looking_to)\r\n\r\nBut these _look_ APIs are camera-oriented since the goal is to align the camera forward to look in a direction or towards a point.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to instead align the coordinate-system itself.\r\n\r\nSo perhaps instead of\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Existing API\r\npub fn looking_to(self, direction: Vec3, up: Vec3) -> Transform\r\npub fn looking_at(self, target: Vec3, up: Vec3) -> Transform\r\n\r\n// New extra API, name tbd\r\npub fn align_towards_direction(self, direction: Vec3, up: Vec3) -> Transform\r\npub fn align_towards_point(self, target: Vec3, up: Vec3) -> Transform\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example of what it does:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// no-op, identity is already aligned as such\r\nlet t = Transform::IDENTITY.align_towards_direction(Vec3::X, Vec::Y);\r\n\r\n// 90 degree rotation, old X axis is now aligned with old -Z direction,\r\n// Y is still up in both cases\r\nlet t2 = Transform::IDENTITY.align_towards_direction(Vec3::NEG_Z, Vec::Y);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo essentially it does the same as `looking_to/at` but it favors (aligns) another axis.\r\n\r\nTherefore perhaps even a more general API could be considered where a user can specify which axis is the target for alignment, and the other APIs can be expressed in terms of that.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nUsing the `looking_*` APIs then doing another rotation after that.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11793/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11793/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
