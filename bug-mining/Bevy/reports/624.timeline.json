Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #12562\r\n- Fixes #12195\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Use `spawn_app` instead of `run_app` for web platform in `winit_runner` as suggested in the [document](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/platform/web/trait.EventLoopExtWebSys.html#tymethod.spawn_app)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Did you test these changes? If so, how?\r\n\r\nTested on web. Created a react app which renders the bevy WASM app and returns the disposer to JS. Js will call the disposer on component unmount to stop the app, the disposer sends a signal to a `signal` receiver in rust which exits the app like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn handle_stop_signal(\r\n    signal: NonSendMut<StopSignalReceiver>,\r\n    window_entities: Query<(Entity, &Window)>,\r\n    mut event_writer: EventWriter<WindowCloseRequested>,\r\n) {\r\n    if let Ok(_) = signal.try_recv() {\r\n        for (entity, _window) in window_entities.iter() {\r\n            info!(\"closing window entity: {:x}\", entity.to_bits());\r\n            event_writer.send(WindowCloseRequested { window: entity });\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- Are there any parts that need more testing?\r\n\r\n  - No\r\n\r\n- How can other people (reviewers) test your changes? Is there anything specific they need to know?\r\n\r\n  - Are all resources released after stopping the app like this? The WASM is still loaded, the LogPlugin complains on the logger re-initialization, but it's a warning anyway.\r\n\r\n- If relevant, what platforms did you test these changes on, and are there any important ones you can't test?\r\n\r\n  - Tested the WASM version on web platform and the native version on MacOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16630/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16630/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15831986848,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86Cwn74zwAAAAOvqPKg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15831986848","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fbc55b84e2b11c62987aef32c9e2bb99bdfb3264","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/fbc55b84e2b11c62987aef32c9e2bb99bdfb3264","created_at":"2025-01-06T23:38:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15831986974,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86Cwn74zwAAAAOvqPMe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15831986974","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-06T23:38:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16177167253,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86Cwn74zwAAAAPEO_uV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16177167253","actor":{"login":"mrchantey","id":25616826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE2ODI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25616826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey","html_url":"https://github.com/mrchantey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7bf79a58ea7893fc63bc7ae06b2b55d4a05b8d5d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrchantey/bevy/commits/7bf79a58ea7893fc63bc7ae06b2b55d4a05b8d5d","created_at":"2025-02-04T11:44:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
