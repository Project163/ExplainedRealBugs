For [Nannou](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/), we need to expose monitor metadata to allows users to programmatically select the monitor. Creative coding applications tend have much more demanding multi-window/multi-monitor setups, and so this information is generally useful.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nWe'd like to implement the following features:\r\n- Expose the data provided by [`winit::monitor::MonitorHandle`](https://docs.rs/winit/0.29.15/winit/monitor/struct.MonitorHandle.html) as a user queryable component.\r\n- Allow creation of a window via a monitor's `Entity`.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nN/A","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12955/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12955/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
