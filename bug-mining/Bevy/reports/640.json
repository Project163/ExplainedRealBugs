This is particularly useful when trying to render a Wry WebView for which the HTML content has a transparent background because it will prevent the Wry container from clipping the rendering surface used by Bevy. This is the last \"obstacle\" I see in order to fully/properly use HTML as a user interface layer for Bevy.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nIt could be to just add `winit_window_attributes = winit_window_attributes.with_clip_children(false);` [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/crates/bevy_winit/src/winit_windows.rs#L128).\nIt could also be a more \"configurable\" approach using Window settings. Not sure considering this is Windows only.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nI don't really see any other alternatives.\n\n## Additional context\n\nN/A\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16544/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
