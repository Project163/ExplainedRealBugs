here for visibility:\n\nMy list of little restructures I'd like:\n* Move bevy_core::Name  into bevy_ecs\n* Move bevy_core::TypeRegistrationPlugin and bevy_core::TaskPoolPlugin into bevy_app\n* Move bevy_core::FrameCountPlugin into bevy_diagnostic\n* Merge bevy_log into bevy_diagnostic (significant overlap between the two crates conceptually IMO)\n* Move platform compatibility stuff out of bevy_utils and out of being inlined in crates and into its own new crate, bevy_platform_support (portable-atomic-util, hashbrown, web_time, etc.)\n* Take all the Future and parallel stuff out of bevy_utils and put it in bevy_tasks\n* Remove all the tracing/log stuff out of bevy_utils entirely, maybe putting some of it into bevy_diagnostic.\n* Put things like bevy_utils::default and bevy_utils::assert_object_safe in a pair of micro-crates that'll never be updated ever again.\n\nThat'd remove bevy_utils, bevy_log, and bevy_core and replace them with 2 micro crates that can be moved out of the repo, and 1 more targeted crate bevy_platform_support\n\n_Originally posted on
