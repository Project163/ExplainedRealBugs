to implement this, few topics to resolve:\r\n1. Where to store the warning mechanism (#15391). Right now it's a macro in the executors, but we need it in observers and `run_once` world methods. Should I put it in `system_param.rs`?\r\n2. There is a lot of `validate` -> `run` patterns. The only reason this is separated is for multithreaded executor, where we want to save on task spawning. This would also help us centralize the warnings.\r\n3. Observers don't return values, so validate support is trivial. The problem is in `run_once` methods, which can return a value. We can either:\r\na) Add `Option` to all return values.\r\nb) Add a new family of methods with `try_` prefix.\r\nThe latter is less intrusive, but in the long run it prevents us from **requiring** `validate_param` before running the systems.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2380650048/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MiniaczQ","id":13040204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwMjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ","html_url":"https://github.com/MiniaczQ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14442152067,"node_id":"MIE_lADODf6-U86XlwqZzwAAAANc0cCD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14442152067","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-28T20:38:46Z","milestone":{"title":"0.15"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2380889451","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15394#issuecomment-2380889451","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15394","id":2380889451,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86N6X1r","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-28T20:40:06Z","updated_at":"2024-09-28T20:40:06Z","body":"Now

Merge `get_param` with `validate_param` into `try_get_param`.\r\n1.1. In naive approach, we always create a system task (multithreaded executor), even if parameters can't be retrieved.\r\n1.2. We can try to run `try_get_param` before spawning a task, but then we need to somehow pass the parameters into the system. (type erasure issues)\r\n2. Keep `get_param` and `validate_param`, add `try_get_param` with default implementation that merges the previous 2.\r\nImplement manually for performance gains.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"MiniaczQ","id":13040204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwMjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ","html_url":"https://github.com/MiniaczQ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-29T19:57:12Z","updated_at":"2024-09-29T19:57:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15526","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15526/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15526/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15526/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15526","id":2555129106,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U859CW88","number":15526,"title":"System param validation for observers, system registry and run once","user":{"login":"MiniaczQ","id":13040204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwMjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ","html_url":"https://github.com/MiniaczQ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Feature","name":"C-Feature","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A new feature, making something new possible"},{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.
