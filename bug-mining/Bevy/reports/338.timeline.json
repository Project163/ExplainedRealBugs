Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #14697\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the existing `all_tuples!` macro to optionally accept a `#[doc(fake_variadic)]` attribute in its input. If the attribute is present, each invocation of the impl macro gets the correct attributes (i.e. the first impl receives `#[doc(fake_variadic)]` while the other impls are hidden using `#[doc(hidden)]`.\r\nImpls for the empty tuple (unit type) are left untouched (that's what the [standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html#impl-PartialEq-for-()) and [serde](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/trait.Serialize.html#impl-Serialize-for-()) do). \r\n\r\nTo work around https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/8811 and to get impls on re-exports to correctly show up as variadic, `--cfg docsrs_dep` is passed when building the docs for the toplevel `bevy` crate.\r\n\r\n`#[doc(fake_variadic)]` only works on tuples and fn pointers, so impls for structs like `AnyOf<(T1, T2, ..., Tn)>` are unchanged.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI built the docs locally using `RUSTDOCFLAGS='--cfg docsrs' RUSTFLAGS='--cfg docsrs_dep' cargo +nightly doc --no-deps --workspace` and checked the documentation page of a trait both in its original crate and the re-exported version in `bevy`.\r\nThe description should correctly mention for how many tuple items the trait is implemented.\r\n\r\nI added `rustc-args` for docs.rs to the `bevy` crate, I hope there aren't any other notable crates that re-export `#[doc(fake_variadic)]` traits.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n`bevy_ecs::query::QueryData`:\r\n<img width=\"1015\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-12 at 16 41 28\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d40136ed-6731-475f-91a0-9df255cd24e3\">\r\n\r\n`bevy::ecs::query::QueryData` (re-export):\r\n<img width=\"1005\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-12 at 16 42 57\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71d44cf0-0ab0-48b0-9a51-5ce332594e12\">\r\n\r\n## Original Description\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\nResolves #14697\r\n\r\nSubmitting as a draft for now, very WIP.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the docs don't show the variadics nicely when looking at reexported items.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n`bevy_ecs::bundle::Bundle` correctly shows the variadic impl:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90bf8af1-1d1f-4714-9143-cdd3d0199998)\r\n\r\nwhile `bevy::ecs::bundle::Bundle` (the reexport) shows all the impls (not good):\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/439c428e-f712-465b-bec2-481f7bf5870b)\r\n\r\nBuilt using `RUSTDOCFLAGS='--cfg docsrs' cargo +nightly doc --workspace --no-deps` (`--no-deps` because of wgpu-core).\r\n\r\nMaybe I missed something or this is a limitation in the *totally not private* `#[doc(fake_variadic)]` thingy. In any case I desperately need some sleep now :))\r\n\r\n</details>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14703/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":5},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14703/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13853599806,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86SlYLezwAAAAM5vSg-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13853599806","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"aab1f8e435c1bed2dc84415f15b259eeb3c380e3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/aab1f8e435c1bed2dc84415f15b259eeb3c380e3","created_at":"2024-08-12T19:10:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13853600067,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86SlYLezwAAAAM5vSlD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13853600067","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-12T19:10:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"janhohenheim","id":9047632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDc2MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9047632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim","html_url":"https://github.com/janhohenheim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-15T11:39:20Z","updated_at":"2024-09-15T11:39:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15208","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15208/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15208/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15208/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15208","id":2526872608,"node_id":"I_kwDODf6-U86WnQQg","number":15208,"title":"Add
