Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #13844\r\n- Warn user when initializing state multiple times\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- `insert_state` will overwrite previously initialized state value, reset transition events and re-insert it's own transition event.\r\n- `init_state`, `add_sub_state`, `add_computed_state` are idempotent, so calling them multiple times will emit a warning.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- 2 tests confirming overwrite works.\r\n- Given the example from #13844\r\n```rs\r\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    App::new()\r\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\r\n        .insert_state(AppState::A)\r\n        .insert_state(AppState::B)\r\n        .add_systems(OnEnter(AppState::A), setup_a)\r\n        .add_systems(OnEnter(AppState::B), setup_b)\r\n        .add_systems(OnExit(AppState::A), cleanup_a)\r\n        .add_systems(OnExit(AppState::B), cleanup_b)\r\n        .run();\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(States, Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]\r\nenum AppState {\r\n    A,\r\n    B,\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn setup_a() {\r\n    info!(\"setting up A\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn setup_b() {\r\n    info!(\"setting up B\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn cleanup_a() {\r\n    info!(\"cleaning up A\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn cleanup_b() {\r\n    info!(\"cleaning up B\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe get the following result:\r\n```\r\nINFO states: setting up B\r\n```\r\nwhich matches our
