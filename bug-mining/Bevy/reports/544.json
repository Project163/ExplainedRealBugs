             I'm not sure this is a good idea to have in Bevy. \"Headless\" meaning will change depending on the use case, and controlling it with a plugin rather than features means longer compile time and a lot of code that can't be used, events not registered, component not reflected, but still available when developing which will mean a less good developer experience.\r\n\r\n_Originally
