Objective\r\n\r\nThanks to @eugineerd's work on entity cloning (#16132), we now have a robust way to copy components between entities. We can extend this to implement some useful functionality that would have been more complicated before.\r\n\r\nCloses #15350.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n`EntityCloneBuilder` now automatically includes required components alongside any component added to or removed from the component filter.\r\n\r\nAdded the following methods to `EntityCloneBuilder`:\r\n- **`move_components`**\r\n  - Syntax: `move_components(&mut self, enable: bool)`\r\n  - Enables/disables removing the components from the original entity at the end of the cloning process, effectively moving them to the target entity.\r\n- **`without_required_components`**\r\n  - Syntax: `without_required_components(&mut self, builder: impl FnOnce(&mut EntityCloneBuilder))`\r\n  - Opens a scope where any components added to or removed from the filter will not automatically involve those components' required components.\r\n\r\nAdded the following methods to `EntityWorldMut` and `EntityCommands`:\r\n- **`clone_with`**\r\n  - Syntax: `clone_with(&mut self, target: Entity, config: impl FnOnce(&mut EntityCloneBuilder))`\r\n  - Easy access to `EntityCloneBuilder`.\r\n- **`clone_components`**\r\n  - Syntax: `clone_components::<B: Bundle>(&mut self, target: Entity)`\r\n  - Shortcut if you just want to clone components with default settings.\r\n- **`move_components`**\r\n  - Syntax: `move_components::<B: Bundle>(&mut self, target: Entity)`\r\n  - Shortcut if you want to move components with otherwise default settings.\r\n\r\nAlso added `clone_and_spawn` and `clone_and_spawn_with` to `EntityWorldMut` (`EntityCommands` already had them).\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n```\r\nassert_eq!(world.entity(entity_a).get::<ComponentA>(), Some(&ComponentA(1)));\r\nassert_eq!(world.entity(entity_b).get::<ComponentA>(), None);\r\nworld.entity_mut(entity_a).clone_components::<ComponentA>(entity_b);\r\nassert_eq!(world.entity(entity_a).get::<ComponentA>(), Some(&ComponentA(1)));\r\nassert_eq!(world.entity(entity_b).get::<ComponentA>(), Some(&ComponentA(1)));\r\n\r\nassert_eq!(world.entity(entity_a).get::<ComponentB>(), Some(&ComponentB(2)));\r\nassert_eq!(world.entity(entity_b).get::<ComponentB>(), None);\r\nworld.entity_mut(entity_a).move_components::<ComponentB>(entity_b);\r\nassert_eq!(world.entity(entity_a).get::<ComponentB>(), None);\r\nassert_eq!(world.entity(entity_b).get::<ComponentB>(),

This issue was closed as completed in #16826, but without the untyped variants (for example `move_by_ids`) only part of what the issue was about was done.\n\nWhen I want to make reversible commands, I need to be sensitive about which components already exist, which are added additionally by the required-component feature and so on. I don't think I can do that solely with `Bundle` as the parameter.\n\nFor example:\n- Entity 1 has components `A` and `B`\n- Entity 2 has component `A`\n\nThe user want to move `A` and `B` from 1 to 2 by using the bundle `(A, B)` as the generic parameter.\nTo make this reversible I need to backup `A` at entity 2 by moving that to some third entity.\nBut I only have the `(A, B)` bundle type and there is no \"move component `A` by the `ComponentId` N from 2 to 3\" in the API of #16826. If I instead try to move `(A, B)` from 2 to 3 this would fail because there is no `B` at entity 2.\n\nCould this be reopened or should I write a new issue that focuses on this?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2637771433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"urben1680","id":55257931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjU3OTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55257931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680","html_url":"https://github.com/urben1680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16199441080,"node_id":"MEE_lADODf6-U86XbWDXzwAAAAPFj9q4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16199441080","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-05T18:59:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16199441093,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86XbWDXzwAAAAPFj9rF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16199441093","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-05T18:59:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
