Also, in reviewing the feasibility of implementing this, the most gnarly part passes through the preprocessing compute shader bits which you wrote.\r\n\r\nMy approach is basically going to be this:\r\n1. Add a new `UserMeshInstancePlugin<T>` that the user can add once per application, where `T` ensures proper alignment, etc.\r\n2. In order not to pollute all the rendering code with a new type parameter, this is going to be type erased as `RawBufferVec<u32>`.\r\n3. Pass this into the compute shader etc as an optional buffer that enables a shaderdef.\r\n4. In the compute shader, bind input, output, and a push constant (or whatever) that indicates the size of the data.\r\n5. After culling, write input to output at the same time as the mesh data.\r\n6. In the user's vertex shader, they are thus able to do `@group(0) @binding(6) var<storage> my_data: array<MyData>;` and use the instance index to look up their per-mesh data.\r\n\r\nDoes this general approach make sense?

this?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2116079525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tychedelia","id":10366310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY2MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10366310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia","html_url":"https://github.com/tychedelia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12839235513,"node_id":"MEE_lADODf6-U86I4UThzwAAAAL9Ry-5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12839235513","actor":{"login":"pcwalton","id":157897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton","html_url":"https://github.com/pcwalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-16T20:00:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12839235530,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86I4UThzwAAAAL9Ry_K","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12839235530","actor":{"login":"pcwalton","id":157897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton","html_url":"https://github.com/pcwalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-16T20:00:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12879697429,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86I4UThzwAAAAL_sJYV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12879697429","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-21T12:46:54Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Triage","color":"D876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nCurrently, it's possible to bind a `Vec` or a raw `Buffer` to a custom material, but this has two problems:\r\n- The `Vec` version eagerly creates a new buffer every frame, regardless of whether the buffer actually needs to be resized. It also isn't usable as a `RenderAsset` as the `Buffer` is created in the `AsBindGroup` impl.\r\n- The `Buffer` version isn't usable from the main world without additional hacks, since a `Buffer` can only be created in the render world. This makes it difficult to work with, particularly if you also want to bind that `Buffer` to another custom pass, like a compute shader.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nWe should implement a `Handle<Storage>` abstraction that can replace both these use cases. This will be the `Buffer` equivalent to `Handle<Image>` and will produce a `RenderAsset` (likely one of our higher level wrapper types, or possibly a new type erased version that avoids needing a generic plugin).\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nIt's possible to work around this right now as noted above, but it's very painful and the docs are confusing.\r\n\r\n##

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\nWhen writing a fragment shader for a material that needs the position of the point relative to the mesh origin.\r\n\r\nFor example, I'm writing a shader for Earth material. The mesh is destructible, so vertex is not only limited to surface vertices, but also to vertices of subterranean holes and crevices due to mesh destruction. So, fragments that is below the planet radius is using some procedural function to create a color similar to a lava.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n- 1. Include the `bevy_pbr::forward_io::Vertex::position` into one of the fields for `bevy_pbr::forward_io::VertexOutput.local_position`.\r\n- 2. Include the inverse of `bevy_pbr::mesh_types::MeshTypes::world_from_local`, name it: `inv_world_from_local` or `local_from_world`.\r\n\r\nEither 1 or 2 will suffice for obtaining the mesh local position.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nCurrently, I wrote a custom struct to hold an output of the vertex shader to include `local_position` like so:\r\n\r\n```wgsl\r\nstruct MeshVertexOutput {\r\n    // This is `clip position` when the struct is used as a vertex stage output\r\n    // and `frag coord` when used as a fragment stage input\r\n    @builtin(position) position: vec4<f32>,\r\n    @location(0) world_position: vec4<f32>,\r\n    @location(1) world_normal: vec3<f32>,\r\n    // the vertex position relative to the scene, this is not yet converted into view space\r\n    @location(2) local_position: vec4<f32>,\r\n    @location(3) instance_index: u32,\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n#ifdef VERTEX_POSITIONS\r\n    out.local_position = vec4<f32>(vertex.position, 1.0);\r\n    out.world_position = mesh_functions::mesh_position_local_to_world(world_from_local, out.local_position);\r\n    out.position = position_world_to_clip(out.world_position.xyz);\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\nThen I can use the `local_position` in the fragment shader to give a color of the fragment based on its position relative to the object mesh.\r\n```wgsl\r\nlet local_position = in.local_position;\r\nlet is_inside = is_inside_planet(local_position);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf an `inverse_world_from_local` is included in `VertexOutput` calculating the `local_position` would simply be:\r\n```rust\r\nlet local_position = inverse_world_from_local * in.world_position;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn cases, where there is no access to vertex shader, ie: Meshlet material\r\nI use a rather expensive `inverse_mat4(world_from_local)` function to get the inverse of the `world_from_local`. Then getting the `local_position` would then just be:\r\n```rust\r\nlet local_position = inverse_mat4(world_from_local) * in.world_position`;\r\n```\r\nThe code for `inverse_mat4` is very expensive,

Objective\r\n\r\nBecause of mesh preprocessing, users cannot rely on `@builtin(instance_index)` in order to reference external data, as the instance index is not stable, either from frame to frame or
