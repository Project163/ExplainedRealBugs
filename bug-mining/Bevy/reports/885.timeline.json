Objective\r\n\r\nDuring the migration to required components a lot of things were changed around and somehow the draw order for some UI elements ended up depending on the system ordering in `RenderSystems::Queue`, which can sometimes result in the elements being drawn in the wrong order. \r\n\r\nFixes #19674\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n* Added some more `stack_z_offsets` constants and used them to enforce an explicit ordering.\r\n* Removed the `stack_index: u32` field from `ExtractedUiNodes` and replaced it with a `z_order: f32` field.\r\n\r\nThese changes should fix all the ordering problems. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI added a nine-patched bordered node with a navy background color to the slice section of the `testbed_ui` example.\r\nThe border should always be drawn above the background color.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19691/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19691/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18418004996,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U867soOlzwAAAARJzHQE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18418004996","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a949867a1c3efed8a3465da292a92c59235bbf37","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/a949867a1c3efed8a3465da292a92c59235bbf37","created_at":"2025-07-01T19:39:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18418005152,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U867soOlzwAAAARJzHSg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18418005152","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-01T19:39:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
