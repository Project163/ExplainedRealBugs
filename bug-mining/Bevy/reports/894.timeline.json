Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #19356\r\nIssue: Spawning a batch of entities in relationship with the same target adds the relationship between the target and only the last entity of the batch. `spawn_batch` flushes only after having spawned all entities. This means each spawned entity will have run the `on_insert` hook of its `Relationship` component. Here is the relevant part of that hook:\r\n```Rust\r\n            if let Some(mut relationship_target) =\r\n                target_entity_mut.get_mut::<Self::RelationshipTarget>()\r\n            {\r\n                relationship_target.collection_mut_risky().add(entity);\r\n            } else {\r\n                let mut target = <Self::RelationshipTarget as RelationshipTarget>::with_capacity(1);\r\n                target.collection_mut_risky().add(entity);\r\n                world.commands().entity(target_entity).insert(target);\r\n            }\r\n```\r\nGiven the above snippet and since there's no flush between spawns, each entity finds the target without a `RelationshipTarget` component and defers the insertion of that component with the entity's id as the sole member of its collection. When the commands are finally flushed, each insertion after the first replaces the one before and in the process triggers the `on_replace` hook of `RelationshipTarget` which removes the `Relationship` component from the corresponding entity. That's how we end up in the invalid state.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nI see two possible solutions\r\n1. Flush after every spawn\r\n2. Defer the whole code snippet above\r\n\r\nI don't know enough about bevy as a whole but 2. seems much more efficient to me. This is what I'm proposing here. I have a doubt though because I've started to look at #19348 that 1. would fix as well.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI added a test for the issue. I've put it in `relationship/mod.rs` but I could see it in `world/spawn_batch.rs` or `lib.rs` because the test is as much about `spawn_batch` as it is about relationships.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19519/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18394859468,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86-FKjqzwAAAARIa0fM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18394859468","actor":{"login":"mgi388","id":135186256,"node_id":"U_kgDOCA7HUA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135186256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388","html_url":"https://github.com/mgi388","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-30T21:06:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-30T22:14:14Z","updated_at":"2025-06-30T22:14:14Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19891","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19891/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19891/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19891/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19891","id":3190007105,"node_id":"I_kwDODf6-U86-I6VB","number":19891,"title":"Optimize

in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19519#discussion_r2175180498_ says:\r\n\r\nWith this change, every branch in this hook (after the `RelationshipHookMode` check) is guaranteed to run a command, right?  It might make sense as a follow-up PR to wrap the entire method in `world.commands.queue(|world| {...})`.  That would avoid having to look up `target_entity` twice, which would also avoid the possibility of it getting despawned in between.  \r\n\r\nHuh, and it also looks like `EntityEntryCommands::or_insert_with` just invokes the closure immediately.  If we work with `world` instead of `commands` then I think we can avoid allocating a new `RelationshipTarget` if it already exists.  Also, I'm going to create an issue for `or_insert_with`, because that behavior is surprising ... #19884.\r\n

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #19884.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Add an internal entity command `insert_with`, which takes a function returning a component and checks if the component would actually be inserted before invoking the function.\r\n- Add the same check to `insert_from_world`, since it's a similar situation.\r\n- Update the `or_insert_with`, `or_try_insert_with`, and `or_default` methods on `EntityEntryCommands` to use the new command.\r\n\r\nSince the function/closure returning the component now needs to be sent into the command (rather than being invoked before the command is created), the function now has `Send + 'static` bounds. Pretty typical for command stuff, but I don't know how/if it'll affect existing users.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19978/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18512414591,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86-FKjqzwAAAARPbQd_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18512414591","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eb6afd26a168f0252e856eea096232af0ff834b2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/eb6afd26a168f0252e856eea096232af0ff834b2","created_at":"2025-07-07T20:33:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18512414746,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86-FKjqzwAAAARPbQga","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18512414746","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-07T20:33:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
