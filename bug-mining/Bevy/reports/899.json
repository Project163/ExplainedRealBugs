How do I handle the fact that the timer actually elapsed 3 times over?\n\nFor some gameplay systems in this example, it might be important that the action that is performed once the timer elapses is performed 3 times. This is also the case for `FixedUpdate`: if there is any large lapse in time, the entire schedule is invoked multiple times until it has caught up.\n\nI think it is important to document exactly how the timer works in these cases. See for example the docs on [`tokio::time::interval`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/time/fn.interval.html) and [`tokio::time::MissedTickBehavior`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/time/enum.MissedTickBehavior.html)\n\nOriginally I put this as feedback on the time chapter for the book: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website/pull/2187#discussion_r2199836965","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20132/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
