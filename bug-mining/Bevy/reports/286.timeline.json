peekability to EventReader for when you want to view an event but not mark it as read\r\n\r\n# Objective\r\n\r\n- Allow the ability to view an event without marking it as read\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Copied the existing iterators and implemented them for peeking, ie. they no longer move the \"last_read\" onwards.\r\n- I also took this opportunity to improve the documentation on EventReader given I was adding explanations for peeking.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Wrote a number of tests to confirm that the new peek iterators work as expected. Renamed a bunch of the existing tests to specify they test read and wrote peek equivalents. Also wrote tests for combination of reading and peeking to make sure behavior was as expected.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13809/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"BobG1983","id":2884376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2884376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983","html_url":"https://github.com/BobG1983","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-13T22:01:29Z","updated_at":"2024-06-13T22:01:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13818","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13818/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13818/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13818/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/13818","id":2347430400,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U85yKofD","number":13818,"title":"Created an EventMutator for when you want to mutate an event before reading","user":{"login":"BobG1983","id":2884376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODQzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2884376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983","html_url":"https://github.com/BobG1983","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BobG1983/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Feature","name":"C-Feature","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A new feature, making something new possible"},{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Objective\r\n\r\n- Often in games you will want to create chains of systems that modify some event. For example, a chain of damage systems that handle a DamageEvent and modify the underlying value before the health system finally consumes the event. Right now this requires either:\r\n\r\n* Using a component added to the entity\r\n* Consuming and refiring events\r\n\r\nNeither is ideal when really all we want to do is read the events value, modify it, and write it back.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Create an EventMutator class similar to EventReader but with ResMut<T> and iterators that return &mut so that events can be mutated.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- I replicated all the existing tests for EventReader to make sure behavior was the same (I believe) and added a number of tests specific to testing that 1) events can actually be mutated, and that 2) EventReader sees changes from EventMutator for events it hasn't already seen.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nUsers currently using `ManualEventReader` should use `EventCursor` instead. `ManualEventReader` will be removed in Bevy 0.16. Additionally, `Events::get_reader` has been replaced by `Events::get_cursor`.\r\n\r\nUsers currently directly accessing the `Events` resource for mutation should move to `EventMutator` if possible.
