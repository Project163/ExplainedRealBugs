Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #18943\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nReintroduces support for `hashbrown`'s `HashMap` and `HashSet` types. These were inadvertently removed when `bevy_platform` newtyped the `hashbrown` types.\r\n\r\nSince we removed our `hashbrown` dependency, I gated these impls behind a `hashbrown` feature. Not entirely sure if this is necessary since we enabled it for `bevy_reflect` through `bevy_platform` anyways. (Complex features still confuse me a bit so let me know if I can just remove it!)\r\n\r\nI also went ahead and preemptively implemented `TypePath` for `PassHash` while I was here.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nYou can test that it works by adding the following to a Bevy example based on this PR (you'll also need to include `hashbrown` of course):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Reflect)]\r\nstruct Foo(hashbrown::HashMap<String, String>);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen check it compiles with:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo check --example hello_world --no-default-features --features=bevy_reflect/hashbrown\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18944/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17440930154,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U860GLHhzwAAAAQPj3lq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17440930154","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"31e9a3c411e918378726a7a185108adc861f1f2b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/31e9a3c411e918378726a7a185108adc861f1f2b","created_at":"2025-04-28T19:48:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17440930348,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U860GLHhzwAAAAQPj3os","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17440930348","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-28T19:48:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17440930948,"node_id":"PVTISC_lADODf6-U860GLHhzwAAAAQPj3yE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17440930948","actor":{"login":"github-project-automation[bot]","id":113052574,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBr0Lng","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/235829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-project-automation","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"project_v2_item_status_changed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-28T19:48:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17698863479,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U860GLHhzwAAAAQe7zl3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17698863479","actor":{"login":"andrewzhurov","id":13056889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDU2ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13056889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","
