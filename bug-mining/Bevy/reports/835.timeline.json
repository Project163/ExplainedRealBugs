Simply removing that line of code made the new test case pass (navigating through `TabIndex` within different `TabGroup`s and kept everything else working as expected as far as I can tell. \r\n\r\nI went ahead and broke the `focusable` vec down into per-group vecs that get sorted by `TabIndex` and appended to the main vec in group sorted order to maintain the sorting that was being done before, but respecting the `TabGroup` sorting that was missing in the issue that this PR addresses.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nI added a new unit test that reproduced the issue outlined above that will run in CI. This test was failing before deleting the sort, and now both unit tests are passing. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"hukasu","id":7583440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1ODM0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7583440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu","html_url":"https://github.com/hukasu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-23T22:05:31Z","updated_at":"2025-05-23T22:05:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19239","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19239/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19239/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19239/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19239","id":3069353097,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86WfhL4","number":19239,"title":"`tab_navigation` example improvements","user":{"login":"ickshonpe","id":27962798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTYyNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27962798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe","html_url":"https://github.com/ickshonpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2272053786,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjcyMDUzNzg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Examples","name":"C-Examples","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"An addition or correction to our examples"},{"id":2276469463,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjc2NDY5NDYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-UI","name":"A-UI","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Graphical user interfaces, styles, layouts, and widgets"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.
