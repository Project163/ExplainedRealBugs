not an expert on rendering either, almost everything I know comes from trial and error and lots and lots of profiling.\nThe main tradeoffs seem to be between the amount of data sent to the gpu each frame, the number of draw calls, the complexity of the shader program, and the number of gpu state changes.\n\nDrawing the border and interior together is actually more performant and fixes the gaps problem as you observed, as long as you are drawing bordered nodes. But then if you use that border+interior shader to draw text you have to send border data along with it which isn't used. You can instead have a separate simpler shader to draw the text glyphs but then you have extra draw calls and state changes every time you swap the shaders.\n\nThere's also the problem that even if we draw the border + interior together we still have outlines that will show the same gaps. Maybe we should draw all three together and have a separate shader for text. \n\nAnyway, I think I'm sounding negative but I don't mean to be. I agree that the gaps are unnacceptable and encourage you to experiment and see if you can come up with any improvements and feel free to ping me for review if you want a second set of eyes on something.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2618433771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ickshonpe","id":27962798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTYyNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27962798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe","html_url":"https://github.com/ickshonpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2619666068","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17561#issuecomment-2619666068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17561","id":2619666068,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86cJO6U","user":{"login":"LucDrenth","id":47307392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzA3Mzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47307392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucDrenth","html_url":"https://github.com/LucDrenth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucDrenth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucDrenth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucDrenth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucDrenth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucDrenth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucDrenth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucDrenth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucDrenth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucDrenth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-28T17:40:43Z","updated_at":"2025-01-28T17:40:43Z","body":"You don't sound negative at all to me.

anyway.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2628950594/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ickshonpe","id":27962798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTYyNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27962798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe","html_url":"https://github.com/ickshonpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"ickshonpe","id":27962798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTYyNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27962798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe","html_url":"https://github.com/ickshonpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-01T13:40:59Z","updated_at":"2025-02-01T13:40:59Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17631","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17631/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17631/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17631/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17631","id":2825218792,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86Ju4hf","number":17631,"title":"anti-alias

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #17561\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe anti-aliasing function used by the UI fragment shader is this:\r\n```wgsl\r\nfn antialias(distance: f32) -> f32 {\r\n    return saturate(0.5 - distance);      // saturate clamps between 0 and 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe returned value is  multiplied with the alpha channel value to get the anti-aliasing effect.\r\n\r\nThe `distance` is a signed distance value. A positive `distance` means we are outside the shape we're drawing and a negative `distance` means we are on the inside. \r\n\r\nSo with `distance` at `0` (on the edge of the shape):\r\n```\r\nantialias(0) = saturate(0.5 - 0) = saturate(0.5) = 0.5\r\n```\r\nbut we want it to be `1` at this point, so the entire interior of the shape is given a solid colour, and then decrease as the signed distance increases.\r\n\r\nSo in this PR we change it to:\r\n```wgsl\r\nfn antialias(distance: f32) -> f32 {\r\n    return saturate(1. - distance);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen:\r\n```\r\nantialias(-0.5) = saturate(1 - (-1)) = saturate(2) = 1\r\nantialias(1) = saturate(1 - 0) = 1\r\nantialias(0.5) = saturate(1 - 0.5) = 0.5\r\nantialias(1) = saturate(1 - 1) = 0\r\n```\r\nas desired.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n```cargo run --example button```\r\n\r\nOn main:\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"bleg\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/314994cb-4529-479d-b179-18e5c25f75bc\" />\r\n\r\nWith this PR:\r\n<img width=\"400\" alt=\"bbwhite\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/072f481d-8b67-4fae-9a5f-765090d1713f\" />\r\n\r\nModified the `button` example to draw a white background to make the bleeding more obvious.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16150168275,"node_id":"MIE_lADODf6-U86nrwA3zwAAAAPCoALT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16150168275","actor":{"login":"ickshonpe","id":27962798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTYyNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27962798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe","html_url":"https://github.com/ickshonpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-01T13:47:28Z","milestone":{"title":"0.15.2"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16150168622,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86nrwA3zwAAAAPCoAQu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16150168622","actor":{"login":"ickshonpe","id":27962798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTYyNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27962798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe","html_url":"https://github.com/ickshonpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-01T13:47:41Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Design","color":"D876E3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16150168624,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86nrwA3zwAAAAPCoAQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16150168624","actor":{"login":"ickshonpe","id":27962798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTYyNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27962798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe","html_url":"https://github.com/ickshonpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-01T13:47:41Z","label":{"name":"S-Ready-For-Implementation","color":"D876E3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16152932121,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86nrwA3zwAAAAPCyi8Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16152932121","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api

problem is just inherent to SDFs I think, because they are an approximation. They are very efficient and simple to use, but there's an equivalent price in visual fidelity.\n\nYou can try to improve things by either drawing the border and background together, or by dilation. The combined border and background approach requires a more complex, less efficent shader. Dilation tends to just move the visual artifacts elsewhere.\n\nThe combined border and background approach isn't sufficient to fix all the problems, unfortunately. I made a nice example, but then this morning forgot what it was and deleted it.. Hacked out some quick ones:\n\n```rust\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_systems(Startup, setup)\n        .run();\n}\n\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn(Camera2d);\n    commands.insert_resource(ClearColor(Color::WHITE));\n    commands.spawn((\n        Node {\n            justify_self: JustifySelf::Center,\n            align_self: AlignSelf::Center,\n            width: px(200),\n            height: px(100),\n            border: px(10).all(),\n            ..default()\n        },\n        BorderRadius::MAX,\n        BackgroundColor(Color::BLACK),\n        BorderColor::all(Color::BLACK),\n        Outline {\n            width: px(5.),\n            color: Color::BLACK,\n            ..default()\n        },\n    ));\n}\n```\n\n<img width=\"375\" height=\"222\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37fa045a-d549-4346-a6ae-aae8497ea90f\" />\n\nThe example draws a solid black node with a black border, and a black outline, against a white background. You can see how pixels bleed through, not just at the node-border boundary, but also at the border-outline boundary. \n\nYou could add outlines to the combined shader as well, but it's also possible to nest nodes:\n\n```rust\nuse bevy::color::palettes::css::NAVY;\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_systems(Startup, setup)\n        .run();\n}\n\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn(Camera2d);\n    commands.spawn((\n        Node {\n            justify_self: JustifySelf::Center,\n            align_self: AlignSelf::Center,\n            width: px(200),\n            height: px(200),\n            border: px(20).all(),\n            ..default()\n        },\n        BorderColor::all(Color::BLACK),\n        BackgroundColor(Color::WHITE),\n        BorderRadius::MAX,\n        children![(\n            Node {\n                justify_self: JustifySelf::Center,\n                align_self: AlignSelf::Center,\n                width: px(160),\n                height: px(160),\n                ..default()\n            },\n            BorderRadius::MAX,\n            BackgroundColor(NAVY.into()),\n        )],\n    ));\n}\n```\n\n<img width=\"357\" height=\"355\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/757a0ed0-5a22-4c26-ad3c-77dab4e716ee\" />","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3318336499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ickshonpe","id":27962798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTYyNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27962798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe","html_url":"https://github.com/ickshonpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
