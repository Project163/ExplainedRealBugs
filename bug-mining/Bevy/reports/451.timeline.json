Relevant PR: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/13953. We are just in a bit of an awkward half-way state.\r\n* There are plans for statically differentiating between an \"entity event/observer\" and a \"target-less event/observer\" (see cart's comment

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #14465\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAlters `ReflectMapEntities` to operate more like `MapEntities` by making it operate on the component itself rather than the `World` post-insertion. As a result, `Observers` never see the in-between state where the scene component has been added, but hasn't yet had its entities mapped.\r\n\r\nAlso brings it more in-line with `MapEntities` by accepting a generic `DynEntityMapper` rather than relying on the `EntityHashMap` and `SceneEntityMapper` implementation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* New unit test for `Observer`s + `DynamicScene`s\r\n* New unit test for `Observer`s + `Scene`s\r\n* Open to suggestions for other tests!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- The existing `map_entities` and `map_all_entities` methods have been renamed to `map_world_entities` and `map_all_world_entities` respectively and marked as deprecated.\r\n  - Figured I'd leave these in some form since the new method isn't exactly a drop-in replacement.\r\n  - ~This is in a separate commit so that they'll be easy to fully remove later.~ Edit: Oops, I forgot I did this and squashed it away. Oh well, should still be easy to remove them if/when desired.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14549/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14549/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"jrobsonchase","id":1553581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTM1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1553581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase","html_url":"https://github.com/jrobsonchase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-25T10:59:44Z","updated_at":"2024-09-25T10:59:44Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15422","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15422/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15422/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15422/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15422","id":2547666727,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U858o-En","number":15422,"title":"Change ReflectMapEntities to operate on components before insertion","user":{"login":"jrobsonchase","id":1553581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTM1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1553581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase","html_url":"https://github.com/jrobsonchase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":2747857990,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODU3OTkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Usability","name":"C-Usability","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A targeted quality-of-life change that makes Bevy easier to use"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Solution\r\n\r\n`ReflectMapEntities` now works similarly to `MapEntities` in that it works on the reflected value itself rather than the component in the world after insertion. This makes it so that observers see the remapped entities on insertion rather than the entity IDs from the scene.\r\n\r\n`ReflectMapEntities` now works for both components and resources, so we only need the one.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* New unit test for `Observer`s + `DynamicScene`s\r\n* New unit test for `Observer`s + `Scene`s\r\n* Open to suggestions for other tests!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- Consumers of `ReflectMapEntities` will need to call `map_entities` on values prior to inserting them into the world.\r\n- Implementors of `MapEntities` will need to remove the `mappings` method, which is no longer needed for `ReflectMapEntities` and has been removed from the trait.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15422/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15422/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14477750109,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86QvhexzwAAAANe8O9d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14477750109","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"40e88dceff62d695869893c9f846bbcf59ab6eb0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/40e88dceff62d695869893c9f846bbcf59ab6eb0","created_at":"2024-10-01T18:50:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14477750412,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86QvhexzwAAAANe8PCM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14477750412","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-01T18:50:15Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14479121040,"node_id":"UE_lADODf6-U86QvhexzwAAAANfBdqQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14479121040","actor":{"login":"BenjaminBrienen","id":42162869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTYyODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42162869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminBrienen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unsubscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-01T20:26:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14516459451,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86QvhexzwAAAANhP5e7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14516459451","actor":{"login":"robtfm","id":50659922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjU5OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50659922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm","html_url":"https://github.com/robtfm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rob
