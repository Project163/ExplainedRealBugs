Objective\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the requested, previously deprecated feature from #17478. Which is concerning the `insert_children` of `EntityWorldMut`. This method inserts children into the tree, at a specific index.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nI mostly copied the code from the deprecated crate [`bevy_hierarchy`](https://docs.rs/bevy_hierarchy/0.15.1/src/bevy_hierarchy/child_builder.rs.html#379) though this is no longer a trait method.\r\nThis code also used `SmallVec` which has later been switched by `Vec`. This was easily interchangeable with working code.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI wrote a unit test covering both `EntityWorldMut::add_entities` and `EntityWorldMut::insert_entities`, simply called `hierarchy::tests::insert_children`. I was unsure what error handling architecture i should be using, but i think the simplest to debug in this case would just be a panic in the case of an index out of bounds.\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\nI find this feature pretty self exoplanetary, but the unit test can also bee informing about what this feature implements:\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Click to view showcase</summary>\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut world = World::new();\r\nlet child1 = world.spawn_empty().id();\r\nlet child2 = world.spawn_empty().id();\r\nlet child3 = world.spawn_empty().id();\r\nlet child4 = world.spawn_empty().id();\r\n\r\nlet mut entity_world_mut = world.spawn_empty();\r\n\r\nlet first_children = entity_world_mut.add_children(&[child1, child2]);\r\n\r\nlet root = first_children.insert_children(1, &[child3, child4]).id();\r\n\r\nlet hierarchy = get_hierarchy(&world, root);\r\nassert_eq!(\r\n     hierarchy,\r\n     Node::new_with(root, vec![Node::new(child1), Node::new(child3), Node::new(child4), Node::new(child2)])\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17558/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ElliottjPierce","id":79881080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODgxMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79881080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce","html_url":"https://github.com/ElliottjPierce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-19T02:01:53Z","updated_at":"2025-03-19T02:01:53Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18409","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18409/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18409/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18409/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18409","id":2930240026,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86PMmt6","number":18409,"title":"Finish #17558, re-adding `insert_children`","user":{"login":"ElliottjPierce","id":79881080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODgxMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79881080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce","html_url":"https://github.com/ElliottjPierce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":2747857990,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODU3OTkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Usability","name":"C-Usability","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A targeted quality-of-life change that makes Bevy easier to use"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.
