Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #18690\r\n- Closes [#2065](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy-website/pull/2065)\r\n- Alternative to #18691\r\n\r\nThe changes to the Hash made in #15801 to the [BuildHasher](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hash/trait.BuildHasher.html) resulted in serious migration problems and downgraded UX for users of Bevy's re-exported hashmaps. Once merged, we need to go in and remove the migration guide added as part of #15801.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Newtype `HashMap` and `HashSet` instead of type aliases\r\n- Added `Deref/Mut` to allow accessing future `hashbrown` methods without maintenance from Bevy\r\n- Added bidirectional `From` implementations to provide escape hatch for API incompatibility\r\n- Added inlinable re-exports of all methods directly to Bevy's types. This ensures `HashMap::new()` works (since the `Deref` implementation wont cover these kinds of invocations).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- CI\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- If you relied on Bevy's `HashMap` and/or `HashSet` types to be identical to `hashbrown`, consider using `From` and `Into` to convert between the `hashbrown` and Bevy types as required.\r\n- If you relied on `hashbrown/serde` or `hashbrown/rayon` features, you may need to enable `bevy_platform_support/serialize` and/or `bevy_platform_support/rayon` respectively.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- Did not replicate the Rayon traits, users will need to rely on the `Deref/Mut` or `From` implementations for those methods.\r\n- Did not re-expose the `unsafe` methods from `hashbrown`. In most cases users will still have access via `Deref/Mut` anyway.\r\n- I have added `inline` to all methods as they are trivial wrappings of existing methods.\r\n- I chose to make `HashMap::new` and `HashSet::new` const, which is different to `hashbrown`. We can do this because we default to a fixed-state build-hasher. Mild ergonomic win over using
