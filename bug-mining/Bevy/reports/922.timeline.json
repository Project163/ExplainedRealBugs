Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #16742\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Adds GPU spans for all the engine's render and compute passes. Related passes have been grouped into a single span (following the same convention as bloom, which was already implemented).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Tested all the various rendering features on Windows 11 + Vulkan and also some on DirectX.\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\nA tracy graph with lots of rendering features enabled:\r\n\r\n![tracy-profiler_K9YpjdqJL5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ac41cf-394e-4cc1-b448-4cab26340501)\r\n\r\n## Follow up\r\n\r\n* Nesting spans - there are 2 problems I encountered that stopped me from implementing this\r\n  1. Spans have to be declared in the same scope so it's not clear how to group passes across nodes in the render graph. Possibly a skill issue on my part :)\r\n  2. Nested spans appear incorrectly in tracy (all on the same y axis). I don't know if this is a bug in tracy, a bug in the tracy_client crate or something to do with the multithreading workaround `end_zone()` hack but I couldn't really get it to work. I left a nested span in meshlet_visibility_buffer_raster for each shadow view so you can see what it looks like by trying the meshlet example (let me know if I should remove it).\r\n* Improve developer usability - after writing the same code over and over I started to feel like bevy should have its own create render/compute pass functions so it can instrument them automatically. It would also make it less likely for future PRs to forget to add diagnostics.\r\n\r\n## Additional notes\r\n\r\nThere were talks on render crate refactors happening - I think the changes are small enough that rebases won't be difficult but also feel free to delay merging until later if it'll get in the way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19191/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19191/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18887033700,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86ircS0zwAAAARlwUNk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18887033700","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-29T21:14:41Z","label":{"name":"S-Ready-For-Implementation","color":"D876E3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18887033709,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86ircS0zwAAAARlwUNt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18887033709","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-29T21:14:41Z","label":{"name":"S-Adopt-Me","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18887036507,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86ircS0zwAAAARlwU5b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18887036507","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-29T21:14:55Z","label":{"name":"S-Adopt-Me","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18887036513,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86ircS0zwAAAARlwU5h","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18887036513","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"http
