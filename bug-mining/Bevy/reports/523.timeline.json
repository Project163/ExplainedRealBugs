Objective\r\n\r\n1. UI texture slicing chops and scales an image to fit the size of a node and isn't meant to place any constraints on the size of the node itself, but because the required components changes required `ImageSize` and `ContentSize` for nodes with `UiImage`, texture sliced nodes are laid out using an `ImageMeasure`.\r\n\r\n2. In 0.14 users could spawn a `(UiImage, NodeBundle)` which would display an image stretched to fill the UI node's bounds ignoring the image's instrinsic size. Now that `UiImage` requires `ContentSize`, there's no option to display an image without its size placing constrains on the UI layout (unless you force the `Node` to a fixed size, but that's not a solution).\r\n\r\n3. It's desirable that the `Sprite` and `UiImage` share similar APIs.\r\n\r\nFixes #16109\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n* Remove the `Component` impl from `ImageScaleMode`.\r\n* Add a `Stretch` variant to `ImageScaleMode`.\r\n* Add a field `scale_mode: ImageScaleMode` to `Sprite`.\r\n* Add a field `mode: UiImageMode` to `UiImage`. \r\n* Add an enum `UiImageMode` similar to `ImageScaleMode` but with additional UI specific variants.\r\n* Remove the queries for `ImageScaleMode` from Sprite and UI extraction, and refer to the new fields instead.\r\n* Change `ui_layout_system` to update measure funcs on any change to `ContentSize`s to enable manual clearing without removing the component.\r\n* Don't add a measure unless `UiImageMode::Auto` is set in `update_image_content_size_system`. Mutably deref the `Mut<ContentSize>` if the `UiImage` is changed to force removal of any existing measure func.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nRemove all the constraints from the ui_texture_slice example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n//!
