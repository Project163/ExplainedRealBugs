These backends are inserted in `SpritePlugin` and `UiPlugin` respectively if the features are enabled. This makes it cumbersome to disable these backends: you have to disable all bevy default features, and then re-enable all features except the picking backends you don't want.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nIf the corresponding feature is enabled, we should add a bool to SpritePlugin and UiPlugin to indicate whether to add the backend. This keeps the existing behaviour that by default, the backends are included. However advanced users can replace these plugins in `DefaultPlugins`, setting the bool to false to disable the backends.\n\n## Additional comments\n\nNote we don't need to do this for the mesh picking backend since it is not included by default: Users must explicitly add the plugin themselves.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16472/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
