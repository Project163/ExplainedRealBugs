Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #14941\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n1. Add a `resolved_border_radius` field to `Node` to hold the resolved border radius values.\r\n2. Remove the border radius calculations from the UI's extraction functions. \r\n4. Compute the border radius during UI relayouts in `ui_layout_system` and store them in `Node`. \r\n5. New `pick_rounded_rect` function based on the border radius SDF from `ui.wgsl`.\r\n6. Use `pick_rounded_rect` in `focus` and `picking_backend` to check if the pointer is hovering UI nodes with rounded corners.\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo run --example button\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea951a64-17ef-455e-b5c9-a2e6f6360648\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nModified button example with buttons with different corner radius:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse bevy::{color::palettes::basic::*, prelude::*, winit::WinitSettings};\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    App::new()\r\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\r\n        // Only run the app when there is user input.

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nOptional transparency passthrough was added to the sprite picking backend in #16388.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\n- I'd like to have the same capability for the UI picking backend. I have some decorative UI panels and I'd like avoid picking triggering when hovering their transparent areas.\n- This was also hinted at in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14941#issuecomment-2313653684 but perhaps we forgot to add a tracking issue.\n- As a bonus: Pending blessing, I'd consider the implementer doing a per-entity solution from day 1, so that you can mark some entities as using the alpha threshold, while others just inherit the global resource. If I had to guess, it doesn't seem much work adding that at the same time, but time will tell.\n- Implementation to be verified but maybe spawning an entity with per-entity picking settings would look like this:\n\n```rust\ncommands.spawn((\n    Node {\n        // ...\n        ..Default::default()\n    },\n    ImageNode {\n        // ...\n        ..Default::default()\n    },\n    ImagePickingSettings { picking_mode: ImagePickingMode::BoundingBox },\n));\n```\n\n- Noting that, for the sprite picking backend, `SpritePickingSettings` defaults to `{ picking_mode: SpritePickingMode::AlphaThreshold(0.1) }` and so the example here is to illustrate that this entity is _overriding_ the OOTB alpha-threshold check to instead use a bounding-box check.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nIf you just have rounded buttons maybe #14957 already works for you, but it doesn't in my case.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17448/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
