seems like a rustc bug. The argument to `embedded_asset!` that behaves weirdly comes straight from the built-in `file!` macro, and it seems like it has an edge case. Here is a code snippet I ran inside the bevy template:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet path: &Path = file!().as_ref();\r\nlet components = path.components().into_iter().collect::<Vec<_>>();\r\npanic!(\"path: {} components: {:?}\", path.display(), components);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in:\r\n\r\nWindows native:\r\n```\r\npath: src\\screen\\splash.rs components: [Normal(\"src\"), Normal(\"screen\"), Normal(\"splash.rs\")]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWindows wasm:\r\n```\r\npath: src\\screen\\splash.rs components: [Normal(\"src\\\\screen\\\\splash.rs\")]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, just to top it off, windows native in a separate project I made to test this:\r\n```\r\npath: src/main.rs components: [Normal(\"src\"), Normal(\"main.rs\")]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know why `file!` has both behaviors on Windows yet, but it makes sense that the Windows paths aren't parsed properly on wasm.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2218849620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kristoff3r","id":160317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDMxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristoff3r","html_url":"https://github.com/kristoff3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristoff3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristoff3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristoff3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristoff3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristoff3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristoff3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristoff3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristoff3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kristoff3r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2218862624","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14246#issuecomment-2218862624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14246","id":2218862624,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86EQSgg","user":{"login":"janhohenheim","id":9047632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDc2MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9047632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim","html_url":"https://github.com/janhohenheim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-09T22:47:44Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T22:47:44Z","body":"@kristoff3r
