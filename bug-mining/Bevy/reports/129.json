[`StdRng` is documented as being *deterministic* in output, but not *portable*](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/rngs/struct.StdRng.html), so there is no assurance that the output will be the same on different platforms or different versions of `rand`. And if we are testing across different platforms, we'd then expect the output to match across all platforms. For further reference from the `rand` documentation, their[ documented expectations for portability/determinism](https://rust-random.github.io/book/portability.html).\r\n>\r\n> Given `rand` minor versions might in the future change the underlying algorithm for `StdRng`, end users might find their tests breaking if they used `StdRng` in their tests after basing them on our examples. Better to instead encourage using the algorithm crates directly if they want to have that extra assurance in determinism. Currently, `rand_chacha` is what is the underlying algorithm for `StdRng`, specifically `ChaCha12Rng`. For game dev purposes, `ChaCha8Rng` would be a better fit to provide higher throughput at the expense of some entropy quality (though it will still be far better than what is probably required).\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @Bluefinger in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12593#issuecomment-2011883060_\r\n\r\nI think a good PR would be to replace all usage of `StdRng` with `ChaCha8Rng`, as suggested by @Bluefinger. There are also a few examples that use hashing instead of a proper RNG function that could benefit from switching too.","closed_by":{"login":"BD103","id":59022059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDIyMDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59022059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103","html_url":"https://github.com/BD103","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12613/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
