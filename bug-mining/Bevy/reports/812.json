See that issue for more high-level details.\n\n## What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nWe are using `!Send` resources to store mostly global data, such as handles, `winit` windows, etc. This blocks the resources-as-components effort, which seeks to eliminate the usage of resources.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nIn order to unblock resources-as-components, we need to remove any `!Send` components and replace them with the use of `thread_local!`. The benefit of using `thread_local!` in this context is that the `!Send` resources we are working with are (at least sometimes) `!Sync`. Wrapping a var in `thread_local!` ensures safety without requiring the wrapped type to be `Sync` or `Send`.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nWe have talked about:\n* Using `static` vars without `thread_local!`, but that requires the var be `Sync`.\n* Creating `!Send` `World`s to store this data. This is the long term plan (see parent issue), but right now we just need a short-term solution so resources-as-components is unblocked","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
