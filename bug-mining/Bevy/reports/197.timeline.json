entirely in place of example colours which demonstrate the meaningful bounds. For RGB these bounds make sense, because RGB is a cube and all values within that unit cube are valid colours that can be displayed on a standard monitor. Whereas, for Oklch, the shape is not a unit cube, and the boundary of valid colours is not a trivial shape.\r\n>\r\n> \"What values of L, C, and H are valid?\" Unfortunately it depends!\r\n>\r\n> I think the best we can do is update the docs to list the component values for key colour values: White, Gray, Black, Red, Green, Blue. Those values should be valid in all spaces (or have a close enough analogues) and give a reasonable hint as to the bounds.\r\n> \r\n> For parameters like hue angle it's pretty easy, since that's just an angle in degrees. Likewise for alpha.

here's what it looks like to me:\r\n+ In order to support wide-gamut spaces (webgpu currently just supports P3 but it's possible it may eventually support more), our `LinearRgb` color needs to be non-normalized. It can't ever be clamped.\r\n+ XYZ is inherently display independent. We can clamp to the positive quadrant, but otherwise we can't bound it (easily, the set of visible colors in XYZ is not a simple shape), so why bother.\r\n+ Lab and Lch are inherently display-independent. We can clamp the chroma components to the locus of visible colors but we shouldn't clamp lightness. But it's not clear what method we should use to turn imaginary colors into real ones.\r\n+ OkLab and OkLch are probably the same story, but I haven't checked.\r\n+ sRGB and it's various alternate encodings HWB, HSV, HSL are all inherently display-referred and should be clamped, but we don't actually need to clamp them ourselves because wgsl will do it for us when we pass them into `rgba8unorm-srgb`.\r\n\r\nConclusion: We should probably remove the `ClampColor` trait. \r\n\r\nThe default color keys sound good in principle, but they can only come from within the space of the srgb primaries. The greenest green on a srgb display won't be the greenest green on a P3 display. This isn't huge issue, but I do think color-picking needs design work. We need to be able to pick colors from the P3 gamut even though they will be stored in non-normalized linear srgb space.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2033443409/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NthTensor","id":16138381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTM4Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16138381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor","html_url":"https://github.com/NthTensor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12346329382,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86ClcOwzwAAAALf5gkm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12346329382","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-03T18:13:32Z","label":{"name":"D-Good-First-Issue","color":"008672"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12346329848,"node_id":"MIE_lADODf6-U86ClcOwzwAAAALf5gr4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12346329848","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-03T18:13:34Z","milestone":{"title":"0.14"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12700458343,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86ClcOwzwAAAAL1AZ1n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12700458343","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","us
