This seems to happen only on Linux with the recently released Nvidia 550 stable driver, works fine with 545.\r\n\r\nBevy calls these functions in this manner. Related https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12199.\r\n\r\n**Repro steps**\r\nGet Nvidia 550 driver (I got it from Arch repositories).\r\n\r\nApply this patch to call acquire directly after configure.\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/examples/src/framework.rs b/examples/src/framework.rs\r\nindex 514fbca92..cb5ef222d 100644\r\n--- a/examples/src/framework.rs\r\n+++ b/examples/src/framework.rs\r\n@@ -416,6 +416,8 @@ async fn start<E: Example>(title: &str) {\r\n                             &context.queue,\r\n                         );\r\n \r\n+                        surface.acquire(&context);\r\n+\r\n                         window_loop.window.request_redraw();\r\n                     }\r\n                     WindowEvent::KeyboardInput {\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `cargo run --bin wgpu-examples boids`\r\n\r\n**Expected vs observed behavior**\r\nI expect the surface to not be outdated like with other platforms and drivers.
