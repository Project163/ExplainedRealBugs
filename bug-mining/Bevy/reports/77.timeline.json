What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nOn WASM, memory cannot be reclaimed  / freed. As a result, loading all of your assets up front in a loading-screen pattern will balloon your memory usage and it will never go back down. See https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12057 for more context.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nAdd an example demonstrating how to load assets one at a time, and then moving them onto the GPU using `RenderAssetUsage` once loaded.\r\n\r\nExplain why this is useful for web.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nWe could make this the default behavior on wasm.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThis came up when helping a commercial user debug performance issues on iOS.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12653/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12653/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
