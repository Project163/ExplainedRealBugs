I'd dramatically rephrase it or extend it with an explanation.\r\nLet me explain by example for you. Say you have the following system set:\r\n```rust\r\nenum GameSystem {\r\n  Loading,\r\n  Playing,\r\n}\r\n```\r\nyou naturally want to configure your set such that systems in `Loading` always run before systems in `Playing` and never the other way around. So you might do this:\r\n```rust\r\napp.configure_sets(\r\n  Update,\r\n  GameSystem::Loading.before(GameSystem::Playing)\r\n);\r\n```\r\nlooks good, but you just ran into a trap! The above registers `GameSystem::Loading` to run in `Update` before *something*, but does *not* register `GameSystem::Playing` in `Update`. Currently, it is valid to have nonsense configurations when the involved sets are in different schedules. Let's do a sub-example:\r\n```rust\r\nstruct ThisRunsInUpdate;\r\nstruct ThisRunsInStartup;\r\n\r\napp\r\n  .configure_sets(Startup, ThisRunsInStartup)\r\n  .configure_sets(Update, ThisRunsInUpdate);\r\n\r\n// watch closely, here comes a magic trick\r\napp.configure_sets(\r\n  Update,\r\n  ThisRunsInUpdate.before(ThisRunsInStartup)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince `Update` always runs *after* `Startup`, scheduling `ThisRunsInUpdate` *before* `ThisRunsInStartup` is pure nonsense. But since they are in two different schedules anyways, Bevy will simply ignore this. Now let's go back to our example from before:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\napp.configure_sets(\r\n  Update,\r\n  GameSystem::Loading.before(GameSystem::Playing)\r\n);\r\n```\r\nThis registers `GameSystem::Loading` in the schedule `Update`, but does *not* register `GameSystem::Playing` in *any* schedule. This means that the `.before` is completely ignored, as it concerns two system sets that are not in the same schedule. As such, it *looks* like you have ordered your stuff, but you did not. For comparison, the following variants all do the *correct* and expected thing and are functionally equivalent.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\napp.configure_sets(\r\n  Update,\r\n  // this is the easiest variant, you probably always want this\r\n  (GameSystem::Loading, GameSystem::Playing).chain()\r\n);\r\n\r\napp.configure_sets(\r\n  Update,\r\n  (\r\n    GameSystem::Playing,\r\n    GameSystem::Loading.before(GameSystem::Playing))\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\napp\r\n  .configure_sets(Update, GameSystem::Playing)\r\n  .configure_sets(\r\n    Update,\r\n    GameSystem::Loading.before(GameSystem::Playing)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes this help?\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2313626438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"janhohenheim","id":9047632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDc2MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9047632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim","html_url":"https://github.com/janhohenheim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14035706690,"node_id":"MEE_lADODf6-U86RcXaPzwAAAANEl-NC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14035706690","actor":{"login":"kivi","id":366163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjE2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi","html_url":"https://github.com/kivi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-27T21:38:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14035706698,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86RcXaPzwAAAANEl-NK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14035706698","actor":{"login":"kivi","id":366163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjE2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi","html_url":"https://github.com/kivi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-27T21:38:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2314947278","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14552#issuecomment-2314947278","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14552","id":2314947278,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86J-0rO","user":{"login":"kivi","id":366163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjE2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi","html_url":"https://github.com/kivi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-28T10:34:21Z","updated_at":"2024-08-28T10:34:21Z","body":"\r\n@janhohenheim
