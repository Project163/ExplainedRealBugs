Bevy version\r\n\r\n2aed777\r\n\r\n## What you did\r\n\r\nI spawned an entity with a component:\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Component)]\r\nstruct Foo;\r\nlet mut world = World::new();\r\nworld.spawn(Foo);\r\n```\r\nThen ran a system that checks whether said component has been added since the last time it ran:\r\n```rust\r\nlet sys = world.register_system(|query: Query<(), Added<Foo>>| assert!(query.is_empty()));\r\nloop {\r\n    world.run_system(sys).unwrap();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\nFrom the documentation of `Added`:\r\n> A filter on a component that only retains results added after the system last ran.\r\n\r\n(and similarly for `Changed`: \"[…] or mutably dereferenced after the system last ran.\")\r\n\r\nThis never happened, yet the entity did not get filtered out the first time the system ran.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\n`SystemMeta::last_run` can not represent the case that the system hasn't been run yet and
