rust\r\n#[derive(Component)]\r\n#[require(\r\n    LockedAxes = ROTATION_LOCKED),\r\n)]\r\npub struct CharacterController;\r\n```\r\nit also works for enum labels.\r\nI chose to omit the type, since were trying to reduce typing here. The alternative would have been this:\r\n```rust\r\n#[require(\r\n    LockedAxes = LockedAxes::ROTATION_LOCKED),\r\n)]\r\n```\r\nThis of course has its disadvantages, since the const has to be associated, but the old closure method is still possible, so I dont think its a problem.\r\n- Fixes #16720\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI added one new test in the docs, which also explain the new change. I also saw that the docs for the required components on line 165 was missing an assertion, so I added it back
