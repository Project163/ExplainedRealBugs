How can Bevy's documentation be improved?\r\n\r\nBevy uses GLTF as the main way to store scenes and 3D assets.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways in which GLTF assets can be optimized, one excellent tool is [gltfpack](https://github.com/zeux/meshoptimizer/tree/master/gltf).\r\nThis tools lists which extensions it supports and some flags to pass in order to disable/enable some of them.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is hard to predict what Bevy will support.\r\n\r\nI propose that a natural place to list this is in the [gltf module docs](https://dev-docs.bevyengine.org/bevy/gltf/index.html).\r\n\r\nOne way to list this could be in a tabular format, for example:\r\n\r\n| Extension  | Supported  | Requires feature  | \r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| KHR_lights_punctual  | ✓  |   | \r\n| KHR_materials_anisotropy  | ✓  |  `bevy_gltf_khr_materials_anisotropy` |\r\n| EXT_meshopt_compression |  ✗ |   | \r\n| ... |  ✗ |   |
