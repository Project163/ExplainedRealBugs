I was having an issue as to why entities weren't spawned, resources weren't mutated using `SystemState`. \r\n\r\n```shell\r\n2024-06-20T13:54:12.328157Z  WARN bevy_ecs::system::commands::command_queue: CommandQueue has un-applied commands being dropped.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is not immediately obvious when this warning comes from bevy where to rather look. I personally spent an evening trying different things, crawling github issues. Before I realized I was missing a single line: `state.apply(world);` after applying mutations ie spawning entities via the commands. \r\n\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\n@alice-i-cecile proposed something like `did you forget to call SystemState::apply` message so it can be useful to track it down the place of issue.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nReproduction code.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse bevy::{\r\n    ecs::system::{SystemParam, SystemState},\r\n    log::LogPlugin,\r\n    prelude::*,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    App::new()\r\n        .add_plugins(LogPlugin::default())\r\n        .insert_resource(PlayerCount(0))\r\n        .add_systems(Startup, spawn)\r\n        .add_systems(Update, count_players)\r\n        .run();\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Component)]\r\nstruct Player;\r\n\r\n#[derive(Resource)]\r\nstruct PlayerCount(usize);\r\n\r\n#[derive(SystemParam)]\r\nstruct PlayerCounter<'w, 's> {\r\n    players: Query<'w, 's, &'static Player>,\r\n    count: ResMut<'w, PlayerCount>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<'w, 's> PlayerCounter<'w, 's> {\r\n    fn count(&mut self) {\r\n        self.count.0 = self.players.iter().len();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn spawn(world: &mut World) {\r\n    let mut system_state: SystemState<Commands> = SystemState::new(world);\r\n    let mut commands = system_state.get_mut(world);\r\n    commands.spawn(Player);\r\n    commands.spawn(Player);\r\n    commands.spawn(Player);\r\n\r\n    // uncomment the following to fix the warnings:\r\n    // system_state.apply(world);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn count_players(mut counter: PlayerCounter) {\r\n    counter.count();\r\n\r\n    println!(\"{} players in the game\", counter.count.0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13944/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13944/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
