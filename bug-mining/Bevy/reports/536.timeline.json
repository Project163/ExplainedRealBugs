Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #16292 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Renames the `ColorText` marker to `AnimatedText`, which is more distinct from the `TextColor` Bevy component.\r\n- Changes the comment language from `A unit struct` to `Marker struct` for better consistency with other Bevy docs.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Locally, example still runs just fine\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16302/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15239746824,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86dm3TJzwAAAAOMXBUI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15239746824","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fb607b1bd1ddb70802d5c39893c8f2612fadd45d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/fb607b1bd1ddb70802d5c39893c8f2612fadd45d","created_at":"2024-11-10T00:09:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15239746851,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86dm3TJzwAAAAOMXBUj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15239746851","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-10T00:09:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15496827973,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86dm3TJzwAAAAObrtRF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15496827973","actor":{"login":"ecoskey","id":56370779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MzcwNzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56370779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey","html_url":"https://github.com/ecoskey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7cb31ddb2595d8e502f3f9293f94ddbc69f2fb8b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ecoskey/bevy/commits/7cb31ddb2595d8e502f3f9293f94ddbc69f2fb8b","created_at":"2024-12-02T17:23:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15830455209,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86dm3TJzwAAAAOvkZOp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15830455209","actor":{"login":"ecoskey","id":56370779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MzcwNzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56370779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey","html_url":"https://github.com/ecoskey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"ht
