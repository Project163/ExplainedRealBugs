Objective\r\nExpose the `winit` functions [drag_window](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/window/struct.Window.html#method.drag_window) and [resize_window](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/window/struct.Window.html#method.drag_resize_window).\r\n\r\nWhich allows implementing move & resize for windows without decorations.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdd the functions `start_drag_move` and `start_drag_resize` to `bevy_window::Window`, which are then assigned to fields in `InternalWindowState`, and propagated to `winit` in the `changed_windows` system.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI've tested that both functions works on x11 and wayland. Not sure if someone needs to test on windows/mac?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n[Screencast from 2024-10-06 11-49-58

Objective\r\n\r\nAdd an example for the new drag move and drag resize introduced by PR #15674 and fix #15734.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nI created an example that allows the user to exercise drag move and drag resize separately. The user can also choose what direction the resize works in.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-10-10 at 4 06 43 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1da558ab-a80f-49af-8b7d-bb635b0f038f)\r\n\r\n### Name\r\n\r\nThe example is called `window_drag_move`. Happy to have that bikeshedded.\r\n\r\n### Contentious Refactor?\r\n\r\nThis PR removed the `ResizeDirection` enumeration in favor of using `CompassOctant` which had the same variants. Perhaps this is contentious.\r\n\r\n### Unsafe?\r\n\r\nIn PR #15674 I mentioned that `start_drag_move()` and `start_drag_resize()`'s requirement to only be called in the presence of a left-click looks like a compiler-unenforceable contract that can cause intermittent panics when not observed, so perhaps the functions should be marked them unsafe. **I have not made that change** here since I didn't see a clear consensus on that.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI exercised this on x86 macOS. However, winit for macOS does not support drag resize. It reports a good error when `start_drag_resize()` is called. I'd like to see it tested on Windows and Linux.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\nExample window_drag_move shows how to drag or resize a window without decoration.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15814/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14665930306,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86ZZtBazwAAAANqKFZC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14665930306","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5157fef84bc66bae84caa6961061fc285a43ba8f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/5157fef84bc66bae84caa6961061fc285a43ba8f","created_at":"2024-10-15T23:56:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14665930373,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86ZZtBazwAAAANqKFaF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14665930373","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-15T23:56:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
