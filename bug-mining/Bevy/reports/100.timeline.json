Bevy version\r\n\r\n0.13.0\r\n\r\n## \\[Optional\\] Relevant system information\r\n\r\n`SystemInfo { os: \"Windows 11 Pro\", kernel: \"22631\", cpu: \"Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10700K CPU @ 3.80GHz\", core_count: \"8\", memory: \"31.9 GiB\" }`\r\n\r\n## What you did\r\n\r\nI have upgraded my game to Bevy 0.13 and tested systems that were working fine in 0.12 and below. Unfortunately I have not been able to find a minimum reproducible example.\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\nSometimes the game enters a state where mouse clicks are completely missed. Entering this state happens 50% or so of the time, once it's in that state, mouse clicks are completely missed until either a keyboad input is registered or the `GameState` changes.\r\n\r\nTwo flows that seem to reproduce it are:\r\n- click on UI (works)\r\n- enter a new `GameState` (placing new items on the map)\r\n- click on the map (works)\r\n- exit that `GameState` and back to previous one\r\n- clicks on the map 100% of the time don't work any more (but on the UI are still fine)\r\n\r\nThe other:\r\n- click on the UI (works)\r\n- enter a different `GameState` than in the flow above\r\n- 50% of the time clicks on the map consistently don't work any more, 50% of the time they keep on being fine.\r\n- In this state without clicks, my game is stuck because of its logic. It can be unstuck via keyboard input (Enter or Backspace instead of Left / Right mouse click) but that's super inconvenient for the player.\r\n- once unstuck via keyboard input, there's again a 50% chance that mouse clicks won't work again.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nI'm using `Leafwing Input Manager` so it's one more layer where the bug could be.\r\n\r\nI am trying to find a minimum reproducible example, but I haven't managed yet.\r\n\r\nClicks on the UI are unaffected.\r\n\r\nThe fact that is 50% or so of the time could be a system order issue, but the my game's logic hasn't changed from 0.12. I haven't touched systems ordering either. Can anything in Bevy have forced a different sorting of systems maybe when building the schedule graph? Just speculation though.\r\n\r\nPossibly related issues: \r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12007: this is a 0.13 regression where there's a \"ghost\" UI node, maybe that's capturing clicks in some way? I have run into it with the upgrade, but in a different scenario.\r\n~~https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12150: this refers to keyboard inputs being sometimes missed.~~\r\n\r\n(Sorry for not providing more specific info and mostly just speculation.)\r\n\r\nEdit: 12150 seems unrelated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12227/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"robtfm","id":50659922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjU5OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50659922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm","html_url":"https://github.com/robtfm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-09T23:17:00Z","updated_at":"2024-03-09T23:17:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12395","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12395/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12395/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12395/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12395","id":2177440951,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U85pJ9lU","number":12395,"title":"don't attempt to set cursor relative position for zero sized nodes","user":{"login":"robtfm","id":50659922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjU5OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50659922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm","html_url":"https://github.com/robtfm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619323,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Bug","name":"C-Bug","color":"d73a4a","default":false,"description":"An unexpected or incorrect behavior"},{"id":2276469463,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjc2NDY5NDYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-UI","name":"A-UI","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Graphical user interfaces, styles, layouts, and widgets"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.
