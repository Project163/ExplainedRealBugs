poked around this but didn't find a good solution. Adding some notes in case they're useful.\n\nI guessed that there are two approaches:\n\n1. The occlusion culling shader should avoid using push constants, or have an alternative method if push constants are not supported.\n2. The occlusion culling feature should be disabled if push constants are not supported.\n\nI only looked at the second approach.\n\nMost of the occlusion culling is disabled by default and only enabled if the camera has a `OcclusionCulling` component. However, parts of the pipeline are set up regardless - see `PreprocessPipelines::early_gpu_occlusion_culling_preprocess` and a few other pipelines containing `gpu_occlusion`. I suspect this is what triggers the shader compile errors, but I couldn't quite nail that down.\n\nI tried disabling these pipelines by setting `GpuPreprocessingSupport::max_supported_mode` to `GpuPreprocessingMode::None` (previously it was set to `PreprocessingOnly`). This was enough to get `3d_scene` working, but I don't think it's the right solution as it disables more than just occlusion culling. Maybe it's a fallback if a better fix isn't ready for 0.16.\n\nI suspect a better solution is for `PreprocessPipelines::early_gpu_occlusion_culling_preprocess` and company to only be set up if `GpuPreprocessingSupport::max_supported_mode` is `GpuPreprocessingMode::Culling`. But this needs quite a few changes and I've run out of time for now.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2746297457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"greeble-dev","id":166992735,"node_id":"U_kgDOCfQbXw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166992735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/greeble-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"tychedelia","id":10366310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY2MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10366310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia","html_url":"https://github.com/tychedelia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-30T21:23:35Z","updated_at":"2025-03-30T21:23:35Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18630","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18630/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18630/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18630/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18630","id":2959108246,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86QtGDg","number":18630,"title":"Use GpuPreprocessingMode::None if features not supported.","user":{"login":"tychedelia","id":10366310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY2MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10366310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia","html_url":"https://github.com/tychedelia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619323,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Bug","name":"C-Bug","color":"d73a4a","default":false,"description":"An unexpected or incorrect behavior"},{"id":2045383863,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQ1MzgzODYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-Rendering","name":"A-Rendering","color":"C6A751","default":false,"description":"Drawing game state to the screen"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.
