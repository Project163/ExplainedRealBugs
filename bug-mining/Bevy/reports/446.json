The render world is responsible for rendering a scene to the screen. To keep the two worlds in sync, all the entities of the render world are removed at the end of a frame and in the subsequent frame the render world is 'rebuilt'.\r\n\r\nThere are [plans for the ecs](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/6493) (mainly involving Relations) that hinge on more things becoming entities. As entities become more fundamental (components as entities, queries as entities), it becomes a problem when the render world removes all entities in every frame.\r\n\r\nI'm mainly attempting to lift this problem from Discord (where it has been repeatedly discussed) to a slightly less transient and easier-to-read format.\r\n\r\nIf I got anything wrong, please tell me. While I think that this problem should be solved, it is sadly also a problem of which I don't know the full details.\r\n ","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12144/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12144/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
