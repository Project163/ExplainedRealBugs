Objective\r\n\r\n- Contributes to #15460\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Added the following features:\r\n  - `std` (default)\r\n  - `async_executor` (default)\r\n  - `edge_executor`\r\n  - `critical-section`\r\n  - `portable-atomic`\r\n- Added [`edge-executor`](https://crates.io/crates/edge-executor) as a `no_std` alternative to `async-executor`.\r\n- Updated the `single_threaded_task_pool` to work in `no_std` environments by gating its reliance on `thread_local`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Added to `compile-check-no-std` CI command\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- In previous iterations of this PR, a custom `async-executor` alternative was vendored in. This raised concerns around maintenance and testing. In this iteration, an existing version of that same vendoring is now used, but _only_ in `no_std` contexts. For existing `std` contexts, the original `async-executor` is used.\r\n- Due to the way statics work, certain `TaskPool` operations have added restrictions around `Send`/`Sync` in `no_std`. This is because there isn't a straightforward way to create a thread-local in `no_std`. If these added constraints pose an issue we can revisit this at a later date.\r\n- If a user enables both the `async_executor` and `edge_executor` features, we will default to using `async-executor`. Since enabling `async_executor` requires `std`, we can safely assume we are in an `std` context and use the original library.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-27T06:20:17Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T06:20:17Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15465","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15465/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15465/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15465/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15465","id":2552097881,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U8584KF6","number":15465,"title":"Modify `derive_label` to support `no_std` environments","user":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Feature","name":"C-Feature","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A new feature, making something new possible"},{"id":1795619327,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/D-Trivial","name":"D-Trivial","color":"008672","default":false,"description":"Nice and easy!

Objective\r\n\r\n- Contributes to #15460\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Wrap `derive_label` `quote!` in an anonymous constant which contains an `extern crate alloc` statement, allowing use of the `alloc` namespace even when a user has not brought in the crate themselves.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- CI passed locally.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nWe can't generate code that uses `::std::boxed::Box` in `no_std` environments, but we also can't rely on `::alloc::boxed::Box` either, since the user might not have declared `extern crate alloc`. To resolve this, the generated code is wrapped in an anonymous constant which contains the `extern crate alloc` invocation.\r\n\r\nThis does mean the macro is no longer hygienic against cases where the user provides an alternate `alloc` crate, however I believe this is an acceptable compromise.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this crate itself doesn't need to be `no_std`, it just needs to _generate_ `no_std` compatible code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15465/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14426963279,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86YF71fzwAAAANb6f1P","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14426963279","actor":{"login":"matteof04","id":36609943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjA5OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36609943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteof04","html_url":"https://github.com/matteof04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteof04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteof04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteof04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteof04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteof04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteof04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteof04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteof04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matteof04/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-27T07:48:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14436043024,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86YF71fzwAAAANcdIkQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14436043024","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6963b58eba4fa7d8cc73389f57699ed31a8216d4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/6963b58eba4fa7d8cc73389f57699ed31a8216d4","created_at":"2024-09-27T20:39:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14436145014,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86YF71fzwAAAANcdhd2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14436145014","actor":{"login":"rudderbucky","id":38639307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjM5MzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38639307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudderbucky","html_url":"https://github.com/rudderbucky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudderbucky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudderbucky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudderbucky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudderbucky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudderbucky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudderbucky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudderbucky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudderbucky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rudderbucky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"79bc482d68fc31afded9acbf31d07a69ddab9ce5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rudderbucky/bevy/commits/79bc482d68fc31afded9acbf31d07a69ddab9ce5","created_at":"2024-09-27T20:47:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_

Objective\r\n\r\n- Contributes to #15460\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Removed `petgraph` as a dependency from the `bevy_ecs` crate.\r\n- Replaced `TarjanScc` and `GraphMap` with specialised in-tree alternatives.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Ran CI locally.\r\n- Added new unit tests to check ordering invariants.\r\n- Confirmed `petgraph` is no longer present in `cargo tree -p bevy_ecs`\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThe `Dag::graph` method no longer returns a `petgraph` `DiGraph` and instead returns the new `DiGraph` type within `bevy_ecs`. Edge and node iteration methods are provided so conversion to the `petgraph` type should be trivial if required.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- `indexmap` was already in the dependency graph for `bevy_ecs`, so its inclusion here makes no difference to compilation time for Bevy.\r\n- The implementation for `Graph` is heavily inspired from the `petgraph` original, with specialisations added to simplify and improve the type.\r\n- `petgraph` does have public plans for `no_std` support, however there is no timeframe on if or when that functionality will be available. Moving to an in-house solution in the interim allows Bevy to continue developing its `no_std` offerings and further explore alternate graphing options.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15519/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15519/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-29T22:42:14Z","updated_at":"2024-09-29T22:42:14Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15528","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15528/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15528/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15528/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15528","id":2555198637,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U859ClUI","number":15528,"title":"Add `no_std` support to `bevy_mikktspace`","user":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Feature","name":"C-Feature","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A new feature, making something new possible"},{"id":1795619327,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/D-Trivial","name":"D-Trivial","color":"008672","default":false,"description":"Nice and easy!
