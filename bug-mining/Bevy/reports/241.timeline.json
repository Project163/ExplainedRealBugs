Objective\r\n\r\nIn #13343, `WorldQuery::get_state` was constrained from `&World` as the argument to `&Components`, but `WorldQuery::init_state` hasn't yet been changed from `&mut World` to match.\r\n\r\nFixes #13358\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nCreate a wrapper around `&mut Components` and `&mut Storages` that can be obtained from `&mut World` with a `component_initializer` method. \r\nThis new `ComponentInitializer` re-exposes the API on `&mut Components` minus the `&mut Storages` parameter where it was present. For the `&Components` API, it simply derefs to its `components` field. \r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Added\r\nThe `World::component_initializer` method.\r\nThe `ComponentInitializer` struct that re-exposes `Components` API.\r\n### Changed\r\n`WorldQuery::init_state` now takes `&mut ComponentInitializer` instead of `&mut World`.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\nInstead of passing `&mut World` to `WorldQuery::init_state` directly, pass in a mutable reference to the struct returned from

The issue\r\n\r\nAt some point (#13442, #13343) the `WorldQuery` API was changed [from this](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/query/trait.WorldQuery.html) ... [to this](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.14.0-rc.2/bevy/ecs/query/trait.WorldQuery.html). Most notably, the function signature of `init_state` and `get_state` changed which didn't cause any direct problems in the bevy repo itself.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems like at least one downstream crate, `bevy-trait-query`, depends on the previous version of this API to access a vital building block: The `TraitImplRegistry` resource. This was previously possible through the `&mut World` argument and now isn't possible anymore. It also doesn't appear to be easily fixable with the current API.\r\n\r\nAlice also mentioned that things like indexed queries wouldn't be possible anymore without access to resources.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13798/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13798/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2212573795","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13358#issuecomment-2212573795","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13358","id":2212573795,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86D4TJj","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-07T20:54:14Z","updated_at":"2024-07-07T20:54:14Z","body":"According to https://github.com/JoJoJet/bevy-trait-query/issues/59#issuecomment-2212516814, the caching isn't actually required to make `bevy_trait_query` work.
