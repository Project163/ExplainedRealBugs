However, the Rust Prelude is special in that it is included everywhere - and its imports can be overridden.\r\n\r\nThis allows for name clashes to happen - and because Rust allows the rust prelude's imports to be overridden, it's not immediately obvious that it will cause problems.\r\n\r\nAs a real world example of this happening, see <https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14902>, where the Bevy Game Engine accidentally introduced a name clash with `std::ops::Drop` - and nobody noticed until they tried to `impl Drop for SomeStruct` in the same file as importing the Bevy Prelude.\r\n\r\n### Advantage\r\n\r\n* Avoid name clash issues similar to <https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14902>\r\n* Where a name clash is wanted or okay, the user can silence the lint - making it explicit to other users that this is intentional.\r\n\r\n### Drawbacks\r\n\r\n* If a user is overriding a item from the Rust Prelude that they don't need, this may result in unwanted lint output.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nI do not imagine this lint could be automatically fixed, so this will be an example of when this lint will show, and how a user might fix it.\r\n\r\nI imagine it should lint on code such as this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub struct Drop;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe lint would suggest renaming the offending struct. Afterwards, it might look like this, which should *not* trigger this lint:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub struct DropEvent;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if a user is okay with the name clash (i.e. they don't use `std::ops::Drop`), they can edit their code to show that they're okay with that:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[expect(clippy::rust_prelude_name_clash)]\r\npub struct Drop;\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/13301/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/13301/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2310522876","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14902#issuecomment-2310522876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14902","id":2310522876,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86Jt8f8","user":{"login":"kivi","id":366163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjE2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi","html_url":"https://github.com/kivi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kivi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-26T15:47:02Z","updated_at":"2024-08-26T15:47:02Z","body":"I thought I would name it Droppable, but then I realized, there is DragLeave, DragOver ... so DragDrop is a good match as it was mentioned in earlier comments.\r\n\r\n_I would like to pull request.
