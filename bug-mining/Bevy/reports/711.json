In particular, it requires that all generic parameters implement Debug.\n\nThis means that the Debug implementations for `Ptr`, `PtrMut` and `OwningPtr` do not function because they require `A: Debug`, and as neither `Aligned` nor `Unaligned` implement Debug, it is impossible to satisfy the trait bounds.\n\nThe outcome of this is that the following code:\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug)]\nstruct PtrWrapper<'a> {\n    ptr: bevy_ptr::Ptr<'a>,\n}\n```\nresults in the following error\n```\nerror[E0277]: `Aligned` doesn't implement `Debug`\n --> src/lib.rs:3:5\n  |\n1 | #[derive(Debug)]\n  |          ----- in this derive macro expansion\n2 | struct PtrWrapper<'a> {\n3 |     ptr: bevy_ptr::Ptr<'a>,\n  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `Aligned` cannot be formatted using `{:?}` because it doesn't implement `Debug`\n  |\n  = help: the trait `Debug` is not implemented for `Aligned`\n  = help: the trait `Debug` is implemented for `Ptr<'_, A>`\n  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Debug` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0277`.\nerror: could not compile `playground` (lib) due to 1 previous error\n\n```\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nImplement Debug for the affected types manually by deferring to the Debug implementation on `NonNull`:\n\n```rust\nimpl core::fmt::Debug for Ptr<'_> {\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut core::fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> Result<(), core::fmt::Error> {\n        core::fmt::Debug::fmt(self.0, f)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\n- Users of the library can work around the broken implementation, by manually implementing Debug for their types. (not preferred because it just ignores the problem)\n- Use [`derive_more::Debug`](https://docs.rs/derive_more/latest/derive_more/derive.Debug.html), which does not use the incorrect trait bounds. (not preferred because it adds a dependency)\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
