full write-up of what's happening.\r\n\r\n- When a new scene handle is added to an entity the [`scene_spawner`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c223fbb4c8a969991d22d73a33d54842f2495674/crates/bevy_scene/src/bundle.rs#L70) system [schedules the spawning of the scene](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c223fbb4c8a969991d22d73a33d54842f2495674/crates/bevy_scene/src/bundle.rs#L83) with the `SceneSpawner` resource.\r\n- As a result an `InstanceId` is created and is pushed along with the necessary data into [`scenes_to_spawn` and `scenes_with_parent`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c223fbb4c8a969991d22d73a33d54842f2495674/crates/bevy_scene/src/scene_spawner.rs#L158-L160)\r\n- Next the [`scene_spawner_system`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c223fbb4c8a969991d22d73a33d54842f2495674/crates/bevy_scene/src/scene_spawner.rs#L390) [checks `scenes_with_parent` for despawned parent entities](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c223fbb4c8a969991d22d73a33d54842f2495674/crates/bevy_scene/src/scene_spawner.rs#L394-L404) and marks down them down. Since our scene parent hasn't been despawned yet, this doesn't yet concern us.\r\n- Instead we move on to [spawning all the scene in `scenes_to_spawn`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c223fbb4c8a969991d22d73a33d54842f2495674/crates/bevy_scene/src/scene_spawner.rs#L429-L431).\r\n- Since our scene is not a dynamic scene, it will eventually be spawned with [`spawn_sync_internal`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/crates/bevy_scene/src/scene_spawner.rs#L236). Importantly for us and our leak a [`InstanceInfo` is created and pushed into `spawned_instances`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c223fbb4c8a969991d22d73a33d54842f2495674/crates/bevy_scene/src/scene_spawner.rs#L247-L250).\r\n- Moving on to the next time `scene_spawner_system` is triggered. Our code has decided to despawn our scene and the system is about to notice and [write it down](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c223fbb4c8a969991d22d73a33d54842f2495674/crates/bevy_scene/src/scene_spawner.rs#L399-L401).\r\n- Problematically `dead_instances` is only used to [check if the scenes we're about to spawn still exist](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c223fbb4c8a969991d22d73a33d54842f2495674/crates/bevy_scene/src/scene_spawner.rs#L405-L411) and nothing else.\r\n\r\nSo leak found. Just add something like\r\n```rust\r\ndead_instances.into_iter().for_each(|id| scene_spawner.despawn_instance(id));\r\n```\r\nto `scene_spawner_system` and et voila leak fixed, right? No, you see I lied to you when I said the `scene_spawner_system` would notice our scene parent pair has despawned. The pair is not in `scenes_with_parent` anymore. Why? Let's go back in time to the first time `scene_spawner_system` ran and spawned our scene.\r\n\r\n- Our scene has [been spawned](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c223fbb4c8a969991d22d73a33d54842f2495674/crates/bevy_scene/src/scene_spawner.rs#L429-L431) and we're about to run [`set_scene_instance_parent_sync`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c223fbb4c8a969991d22d73a33d54842f2495674/crates/bevy_scene/src/scene_spawner.rs#L435) which is what breaks our original fix.\r\n- You see [`set_scene_instance_parent_sync`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c223fbb4c8a969991d22d73a33d54842f2495674/crates/bevy_scene/src/scene_spawner.rs#L335C19-L335C49) will [`mem::take` the `scenes_with_parent` vec](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/c223fbb4c8a969991d22d73a33d54842f2495674/crates/bevy_scene/src/scene_spawner.rs#L336) leaving it empty.\r\n- So the next time `scene_spawner_system` runs `scenes_with_parent` won't contain our now despawned scene, its InstanceId won't be logged in `dead_instances` and our original fix won't remove anything.\r\n\r\nAs things stand, the fix is unlikely to be trivial, requiring a good understanding of how scene data is passed around the `SceneSpawner`. This write-up took a while and it's getting pretty late here so if anybody wants to take a stab at it I wish you good luck.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2026319114/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Brezak","id":59848927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODQ4OTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59848927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brezak","html_url":"https://github.com/Brezak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brezak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brezak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brezak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brezak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brezak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brezak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brezak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brezak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Brezak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2026665028","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12746#issuecomment-2026665028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12746","id":2026665028,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U854zHRE","user":{"login":"LordRatte","id":8794574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8794574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LordRatte","html_url":"https://github.com/LordRatte","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LordRatte/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LordRatte/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LordRatte/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LordRatte/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LordRatte/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LordRatte/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LordRatte/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LordRatte/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LordRatte/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-29T05:17:08Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T05:17:08Z","body":"Do we know when the bug was introduced?
