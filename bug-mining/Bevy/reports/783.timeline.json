Objective\r\nReduce duplication in the `bevy_pbr` shaders by using a function to create `LightingInput` from `PbrInput` which can then be shared between `apply_pbr_lighting` and `ssr::fragment`.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nI created a function `pbr_input_to_lighting_input` in `pbr_lighting` to do this (lighting seemed the most logical place for it as that is where `LightingInput` lives and in a higher level language this would be a constructor). This also required moving `calculate_F0` and `calculate_diffuse_color` into `pbr_lighting` to prevent a circular dependency (infinite load during shader compilation), this makes sense for `calculate_F0` as this is now the only thing that uses it but `calculate_diffuse_color` does still have another user file.\r\n\r\n## Questions for reviewers\r\n\r\n- Should `pbr_input_to_lighting_input` instead accept a `ptr` to `PbrInput`, I don't feel like I have a sufficient grasp of shader optimisers to know whether this is better (or if we can trust this should always be inlined)?\r\n- Should it instead live in `pbr_functions` which has the advantage of making this a non-breaking change (because no functions would have to move) but separates a constructor from its struct definition?\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI ran `ssr` and `anisotropy` and checked them for visual issues/crashes and ran as much CI as I could before running out of disk space. I tried to test `clearcoat` but that example is broken for me (#18104)\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nShader function changes:\r\n  - `calculate_diffuse_color` and `calculate_F0` have been moved from `bevy_pbr::pbr_functions` to
