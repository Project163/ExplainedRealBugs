Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #11740 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Turned `Mesh::set_indices` into `Mesh::insert_indices` and added related methods for completeness.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Replaced `Mesh::set_indices(indices: Option<Indices>)` with `Mesh::insert_indices(indices: Indices)`\r\n- Replaced `Mesh::with_indices(indices: Option<Indices>)` with `Mesh::with_inserted_indices(indices: Indices)` and `Mesh::with_removed_indices()` mirroring the API for inserting / removing attributes.\r\n- Updated the examples and internal uses of the APIs described above.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- Use  `Mesh::insert_indices` or `Mesh::with_inserted_indices` instead of  `Mesh::set_indices` / `Mesh::with_indices`.\r\n- If you have passed `None` to `Mesh::set_indices` or `Mesh::with_indices` you should use `Mesh::remove_indices` or `Mesh::with_removed_indices` instead.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11745/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11725210476,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U85-Yk7azwAAAAK64INs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11725210476","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4c86ad6aed5450db295ebd6da9da0a49f3cc2699","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/4c86ad6aed5450db295ebd6da9da0a49f3cc2699","created_at":"2024-02-06T23:47:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11725210548,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U85-Yk7azwAAAAK64IO0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11725210548","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-06T23:47:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
