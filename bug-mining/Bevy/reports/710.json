Modify the `Relationship` derive code (actually part of the Component macro) to work with named structs with a single `Entity` field.\n2. Add a doc test for this.\n3. Refactor the `ChildOf` component and clean up all of the breakage.\n4. Rename a few variables to `parent` to make the code cleaner.\n\nTake a peek at the Deref / DerefMut derives for tips on implementation, although you don't need to get fancy with attributes (see below).\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nWhen this idea was initially proposed, Cart and I thought that marking a specific field as `#[relationship_target]` would be helpful to increase flexibility.\n\nThis isn't needed for the initial PR. Moreover, implementing [`Relationship::from`](https://dev-docs.bevyengine.org/bevy/ecs/relationship/trait.Relationship.html) in the derive for arbitrary structs which might contain data is not particularly feasible without adding quite a bit more complexity.\n\nDon't bother with it for now! Advanced users can do a manual impl for now.\n\n## Additional context\n\nI started tackling this today, hence the detailed notes. I'm not great at macros though, so I didn't finish it and I'm shouting into the void in the hopes that one of our lovely contributors finishes it. Bother me if you want to see my draft branch, but it's not particularly helpful beyond these notes.","closed_by":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17896/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
