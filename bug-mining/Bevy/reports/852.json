That accessor unconditionally send an `AssetEvent::Modified` when called. There's no possible escape hatch, even using `Mut` or `ResMut`, because that feature is baked into the underlying mutable access a level under `Mut` and `ResMut`.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic in particular for the end goal of erasing the differences of component vs. asset (for a function which doesn't care where the target object is coming from) and trying to obtain a `Mut<A: Asset>` from a `Mut<Assets<A>>` and a `Handle<A>`. You can call `reborrow()` to go from `ResMut<Assets<A>>` to `Mut<Assets<A>>`, and then `map_unchanged()` to go from `Mut<Assets<A>>` to `Mut<A>`, but unfortunately during the latter call you need to call `Assets::get_mut()` and that will send a mutation event.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn sys(assets: ResMut<Assets<A>>, handle: Handle<A>) -> Mut<A> {\r\n  let mut_assets: Mut<Assets<A>> = assets.reborrow();\r\n  let mut_asset: Mut<A> = mut_assets.map_unchanged(|a| a.get_mut(handle)); // game over; get_mut() already sent an event\r\n  mut_asset\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl<A: Asset> Assets<A> {\r\n  fn bypass_change_detection(&mut self, id: impl Into<AssetId<A>>) -> Option<&mut A> {\r\n    // exactly the same as get_mut(), without sending any AssetEvent::Modified\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nAt the minute I add my own indirection `Targetable` trait _on top of_ `Mut<T>`, so that I can hold either the `Mut<C: Component>`, or the `Mut<Assets<A>>` _and_ the associated `Handle<A>`. This is impractical and feels silly.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/djeedai/bevy_tweening/blob/d484c5a6c2d62a5fb5526ab3dc0720d533080668/src/tweenable.rs#L196-L205","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
