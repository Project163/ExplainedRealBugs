Objective\r\n\r\n- fix #12853\r\n- Make `Table::allocate` faster\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nThe PR consists of multiple steps:\r\n\r\n1) For the component data: create a new data-structure that's similar to `BlobVec` but doesn't store `len` & `capacity` inside of it: \"BlobArray\" (name suggestions welcome) \r\n2) For the `Tick` data: create a new data-structure that's similar to `ThinSlicePtr` but supports dynamic reallocation: \"ThinArrayPtr\" (name suggestions welcome)\r\n3) Create a new data-structure that's very similar to `Column` that doesn't store `len` & `capacity` inside of it: \"ThinColumn\"\r\n4) Adjust the `Table` implementation to use `ThinColumn` instead of `Column`\r\n\r\nThe result is that only one set of `len` & `capacity` is stored in `Table`, in `Table::entities`\r\n\r\n### Notes Regarding Performance\r\nApart from shaving off some excess memory in `Table`, the changes have also brought noteworthy performance improvements: \r\nThe previous implementation relied on `Vec::reserve` & `BlobVec::reserve`, but that redundantly repeated the same if statement (`capacity` == `len`). Now that check could be made at the `Table` level because the capacity and length of all the columns are synchronized; saving N branches per allocation. The result is a respectable performance improvement per every `Table::reserve` (and subsequently `Table::allocate`) call. \r\n\r\nI'm hesitant to give exact numbers because I don't have a lot of experience in profiling and benchmarking, but these are the results I got so far:\r\n\r\n*`add_remove_big/table` benchmark after the implementation:*\r\n\r\n![after_add_remove_big_table](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/46227443/b667da29-1212-4020-8bb0-ec0f15bb5f8a)\r\n\r\n*`add_remove_big/table` benchmark in main branch (measured in comparison to the implementation):*\r\n\r\n![main_add_remove_big_table](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/46227443/41abb92f-3112-4e01-b935-99696eb2fe58)\r\n\r\n*`add_remove_very_big/table` benchmark after the implementation:*\r\n\r\n![after_add_remove_very_big](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/46227443/f268a155-295b-4f55-ab02-f8a9dcc64fc2)\r\n\r\n*`add_remove_very_big/table` benchmark in main branch (measured in comparison to the implementation):*\r\n\r\n![main_add_remove_very_big](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/46227443/78b4e3a6-b255-47c9-baee-1a24c25b9aea)\r\n\r\ncc @james7132 to verify\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- New data-structure that's similar to `BlobVec` but doesn't store `len` & `capacity` inside of it: `BlobArray`\r\n- New data-structure that's similar to `ThinSlicePtr` but supports dynamic allocation:`ThinArrayPtr`\r\n- New data-structure that's very similar to `Column` that doesn't store `len` & `capacity` inside of it: `ThinColumn`\r\n- Adjust the `Table` implementation to use `ThinColumn` instead of `Column`\r\n- New benchmark: `add_remove_very_big` to benchmark the performance of spawning a lot of entities with a lot of components (15) each\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n`Table` now uses `ThinColumn` instead of `Column`. That means that methods that previously returned `Column`, will now return `ThinColumn` instead.\r\n\r\n`ThinColumn` has a much more limited and low-level API, but you can still achieve the same things in `ThinColumn` as you did in `Column`. For example, instead of calling `Column::get_added_tick`, you'd call `ThinColumn::get_added_ticks_slice` and index it to get the specific added tick.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12929/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12929/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14282145288,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86EaIOXzwAAAANTSD4I","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14282145288","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9bda913e36dcc80e3aff675badcf23dc81a64c6e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/9bda913e36dcc80e3aff675badcf23dc81a64c6e","created_at":"2024-09-16T23:09:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14282145418,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86EaIOXzwAAAANTSD6K","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14282145418","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-16T23:09:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
