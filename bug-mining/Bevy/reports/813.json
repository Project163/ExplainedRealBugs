This is particularly frustrating for third-party system param, as orphan rules prevent users from writing their own.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nReplacing the existing manual implementations with a blanket impl for all `SystemParam`.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nAdd manual impls for all of Bevy's first-party system param. This is more boilerplate, doesn't help external system param types, and doesn't play nice with generic code.\r\n\r\nNote that some system param (like `Entities`) will *always* exist, so this approach does reduce the footgun potential.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nRaised [on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/691052431974465548/1220487322341085244).\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12634/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
