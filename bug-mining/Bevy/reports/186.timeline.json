Objective\r\n\r\nA `RawWindowHandle` is only valid as long as the window it was retrieved from is alive. Extend the lifetime of the window, so that the `RawWindowHandle` doesn't outlive it, and bevy doesn't crash when closing a window a pipelined renderer is drawing to.\r\n\r\n- Fix #11236\r\n- Fix #11150\r\n- Fix #11734\r\n- Alternative to / Closes #12524\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIntroduce a `WindowWrapper` that takes ownership of the window. Require it to be used when constructing a `RawHandleWrapper`. This forces windowing backends to store their window in this wrapper.\r\n\r\nThe `WindowWrapper` is implemented by storing the window in an `Arc<dyn Any + Send + Sync>`.\r\n\r\nWe use dynamic dispatch here because we later want the `RawHandleWrapper` to be able dynamically hold a reference to any windowing backend's window.\r\n\r\nBut alas, the `WindowWrapper` itself is still practically invisible to windowing backends, because it implements `Deref` to the underlying window, by storing its type in a `PhantomData`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- Added `WindowWrapper`, which windowing backends are now required to use to store their underlying window.\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- Fixed a safety problem which caused crashes when closing bevy windows when using pipelined rendering.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- Windowing backends now need to store their window in the new `WindowWrapper`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12978/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12978/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12659024795,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U857TkW0zwAAAALyiWOb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12659024795","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9973f0c8a377c75fd1ccea83da114bd931e845dc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/9973f0c8a377c75fd1ccea83da114bd931e845dc","created_at":"2024-04-30T14:28:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12659025049,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U857TkW0zwAAAALyiWSZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12659025049","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-30T14:28:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"luca-della-vedova","id":9111558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9111558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-della-vedova","html_url":"https://github.com/luca-della-vedova","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-della-vedova/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-della-vedova/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-della-vedova/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-della-vedova/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-della-vedova/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-della-vedova/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-della-vedova/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-della-vedova/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luca-della-vedova/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-25T08:59:47Z","updated_at":"2024-07-25T08:59:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-rmf/rmf_site/issues/232","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-rmf/rmf_site","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-rmf/rmf_site/issues/232/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-rmf/rmf_site/issues/232/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/open-rmf/rmf_site/issues/232/events","html_url":"https://github.com/open-rmf/rmf_site/pull/232","id":2428988108,"node_id":"PR_kwDOHIU8n852ajgB","number":232,"title":"Update
