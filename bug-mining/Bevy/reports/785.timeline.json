investigated this and found that this is because of some strange semantics we were relying on. If you have multiple `Material` types on a mesh, then it will be drawn multiple times, one for each material type. The `Wireframe` component exploits this by adding a wireframe material to a mesh, regardless of other materials it might have already had. This breaks the assumption, used throughout rendering, that each main entity maps to at most one mesh instance. The failure we noticed is just the first time it broke, but `Wireframe` has been fundamentally broken for some time.\n\nThere are two main ways I can see to solve this:\n\n1. Change everywhere we key off main entities in rendering to key off a (main entity, material type ID) pair instead.\n\n2. Specify that including `Wireframe` at the same time as a material is undefined behavior. If you want to fill *and* draw a wireframe, apps must duplicate the entity, once for the fill and once for the wireframe.\n\nI prefer (2), because (a) I don't want to slow down and bloat rendering just for this one use case; (b) fill-and-wireframe mode is usually used for debugging and so a little pain on the user's side is preferable to slowing down rendering; (c) the current semantics is incompatible with the long-term direction we want to go with for materials, where different shaders map to the same *dynamic material* type instead of having a separate type for each material. But opinions are welcomed
