I think applying the global handler to the system result handler by default makes some sense. I'd prefer that we tackle unification in a separate PR though.\n\n> I had some idea that we could be returning these errors to the scheduler through the sync-point system, idk if that's a viable.\n\nWorth considering all of our options. Imo the direct handler approach is nice because it gives us both granularity and nice performance (no need to queue results up, look up which handler to use, etc). I think we should start from there with essentially optimal performance and then compare against the fancier options later.\n\n> I don't really think this will be a niche feature though. Don't we anticipate the editor using custom error handling to populate an error console? But that's nothing to do with the implementation\n\nHmmm yeah thats true. Although thats an implementation we'd own ourselves, and editor integration would likely be behind a cargo feature (so we could abstract that out from a user perspective). I think the majority of users shouldn't need to explicitly think about custom global error handlers.\n\n_Originally posted by @cart in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17215#issuecomment-2576481039_\n            ","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17272/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
