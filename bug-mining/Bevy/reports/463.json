Problem\r\n\r\n#14284 added a direct, non-optional dependency on `bevy_winit` from `bevy_render`.\r\n\r\nThis is messy for our crate structure, and makes it much harder to use `bevy_render` on exotic platforms.\r\n\r\nIt's also causing issues for contributors:\r\n\r\n>  I'm having issues running tests locally on main. Trying tests like (e.g. cargo test --package bevy_ui --lib layout::ui_surface::tests) I'm getting The platform you're compiling for is not supported by winit\r\n\r\nFrom @StrikeForceZero on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/692572690833473578/1290679083897851925).\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution: revert the cursor icon PR.\r\n\r\nRevert #14284 and reopen #14351.\r\n\r\nSolves this problem very directly, at the expense of a valuable feature. Back to the drawing board, where *none* of the options seemed very good.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution: make the dependency optional by feature-flagging cursor icons\r\n\r\nStill messy, but something that can be worked around. Doesn't lose us the nice feature.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution: bevy_cursors crate\r\n\r\nLift this code out into its *own* crate, which depends on `bevy_winit` and `bevy_render`. Probably the cleanest conceptually, but now we have yet another tiny crate to maintain.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15565/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
