Bevy version\nBevy 0.15.3\nAlso reproduced on 0.16.0-rc1 and main\n\n## Relevant system information\n```ignore\n2025-03-21T01:30:21.231373Z  INFO bevy_render::renderer: AdapterInfo { name: \"AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX\", vendor: 4098, device: 29772, device_type: DiscreteGpu, driver: \"AMD proprietary driver\", driver_info: \"24.12.1 (LLPC)\", backend: Vulkan }\n```\n\n## What you did\nRun the following example and press the A key on your keyboard:\n```\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_systems(Startup, setup_scene)\n        .add_systems(Update, remove_first_strong_handle)\n        .run();\n}\n\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct FirstStrongHandle;\n\nfn setup_scene(\n    mut commands: Commands,\n    mut meshes:

     commands.entity(query.single()).despawn(); // Need an `.unwrap()` after `.single()` if testing on 0.16.0-rc1 or main\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## What went wrong\nOnly the first entity with the material handle is despawned however the second cube also disappears.\n\nBefore pressing A:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4b2179a-5527-4651-96b9-e7159eb33fd9)\n\nAfter pressing A:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30c24690-bb60-431a-bfb0-0c53f155680f)\n\n## Additional information\nDiscord message with where this is most likely happening:

At the bottom of track_assets, AssetEvent::Unused is queued and there is a call to remove_dropped(). However, in remove_dropped() the asset isn't dropped if there's duplicate handles but AssetEvent::Unused is still queued. I also see that in extract_render_asset() the asset id is inserted into a removed hashset. Shouldn't this only be done if AssetEvent::Removed is fired? Or on the other side, don't queue AssetEvent::Unused unless there's 0 duplicate handles (as remove_dropped() checks for)?","closed_by":{"login":"superdump","id":302146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump","html_url":"https://github.com/superdump","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18457/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
