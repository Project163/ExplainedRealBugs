That would have been my first guess as to the culprit for the crash, as you need that cargo feature if you want to use the fancier tonemapping algorithms. But since you have included it in the configuration where you say you get the crash, that's clearly not the problem.\r\n\r\nWe should investigate. Since you say the `bevy_ui` feature makes a difference, my initial gut feeling would be to look at how the render graph and camera configuration changes with vs without bevy_ui. Maybe look at setup code in the `bevy_ui` crate to see what it does to the camera and render graph and if it changes anything relevant.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2081116501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"inodentry","id":40234599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjM0NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40234599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry","html_url":"https://github.com/inodentry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12632737725,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86HIGUTzwAAAALw-Ee9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12632737725","actor":{"login":"inodentry","id":40234599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjM0NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40234599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry","html_url":"https://github.com/inodentry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-27T18:05:38Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Triage","color":"D876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12632737726,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86HIGUTzwAAAALw-Ee-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12632737726","actor":{"login":"inodentry","id":40234599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjM0NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40234599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry","html_url":"https://github.com/inodentry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-27T18:05:38Z","label":{"name":"A-Rendering","color":"C6A751"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12632737729,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86HIGUTzwAAAALw-EfB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12632737729","actor":{"login":"inodentry","id":40234599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjM0NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40234599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry","html_url":"https://github.com/inodentry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-27T18:05:38Z","label":{"name":"C-Crash","c
