Unfortunately, these have no property that makes them distinguishable as \"owned by an engine service.\" Systems that clear large numbers of entities on state change (for example) will sweep up and nuke RegisteredSystems.\r\n\r\n(In my case, this means by RegisteredSystems are blown away as soon as the game is loaded.)\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nA simple solution that also keeps internals private is to mark all Bevy owned entities with a common marker.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Component)]\r\npub struct SystemEntity;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way these entities can be selectively excluded by end users.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is to not keep internal components secret, but the above solution is meant to maximize keeping internal details hidden while also giving the user a hook to interact with system owned entities.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}
