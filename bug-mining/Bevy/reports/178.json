However, the animation clips used by bevy are read only. \r\nI understand that this is probably due to the fact that animation assets are tied to their loading files and the logic of having code modifying it can seem weird. However for a game editor I believe it would still make sense to have tools that allow animation edition within bevy ? \r\n\r\nWould it be possible to have mutable access to VariableCurves or expose functions that would allow the modification of animation asset inside bevy ? \r\n\r\nMy goal is then to export this animation into a brand new animation file. \r\n\r\nFor now the only solution I can think of is to fork bevy and force this mutable animation setup OR make a new animation plugin which would consist of a lot of duplicated code. Another way would be to create a brand new AnimationClip everytime I make an edit using the only mutable function exposed by AnimationClip (add_curve_to_target) but this would kill my performance... \r\n\r\nI'm failry new to Rust and Bevy so bare with me if there are obvious solutions. \r\nThanks !
