How can Bevy's documentation be improved?\r\n\r\n`fake_variadic` allows docs on `docs.rs` to pretend they use variadics to hide tuple implementation spam.\r\nIt requires `#![cfg_attr(docsrs, feature(doc_cfg, rustdoc_internals))]` on `lib.rs`.\r\n\r\nThis is an secret, undocumented internal feature for the standard library, as far as I know. *Buuuuuut* there is a precedent of popular crates using it... namely serde!\r\n\r\nSee https://docs.rs/serde/latest/src/serde/de/impls.rs.html#1480-1509 for a usage example and https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/trait.Deserialize.html#impl-Deserialize%3C'de%3E-for-(T,) for how it is rendered:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"961\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8d1f518-8b82-457b-86a6-7f41ca91fe8a\">\r\n\r\nThe exact usage is:\r\n- Use the following annotation for the first impl:\r\n```rust\r\n#[cfg_attr(docsrs, doc(fake_variadic))]\r\n#[cfg_attr(\r\n    docsrs,\r\n    doc = \"This trait is implemented for tuples up to 16 items long.\"\r\n)]\r\n```\r\n- use `#[cfg_attr(docsrs, doc(hidden))]` on the other impls\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14697/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":4},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
