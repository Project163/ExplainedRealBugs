Update cameras in `Update`: jittery mess and nasty footgun.\r\n2. Update cameras in `PreUpdate`: delays during state transitions to unpause, needs to be ordered relative to input sets.\r\n3. Update cameras in `FixedUpdate`: unidiomatic and unresponsive.\r\n4. Add a new default schedule: messy and incurs overhead for users who don't care.\r\n5. Encourage users to add their own schedule: annoying boilerplate, and still a footgun.\r\n6. Move `RunFixedMainSchedule` to after `Update`: lots of implications. Might actually be correct?

provide more detail about\r\n```\r\nIn first person games, many things are dependent on the current camera rotation. For example, I am currently writing a plugin for picking up props. These want to be as close to the center of the screen as possible while held. This means that I need to update my camera's transform before running the physics. \r\n```\r\n\r\nYou're saying that the physics systems depend on the camera transform, so physics should run only after camera transform?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2305382563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cBournhonesque","id":8112632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTI2MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8112632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cBournhonesque","html_url":"https://github.com/cBournhonesque","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cBournhonesque/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cBournhonesque/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cBournhonesque/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cBournhonesque/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cBournhonesque/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cBournhonesque/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cBournhonesque/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cBournhonesque/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cBournhonesque/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2305485772","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14873#issuecomment-2305485772","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14873","id":2305485772,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86JauvM","user":{"login":"janhohenheim","id":9047632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDc2MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9047632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim","html_url":"https://github.com/janhohenheim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-22T19:31:55Z","updated_at":"2024-08-22T19:31:55Z","body":"@cBournhonesque my physics depend on the camera position. In the video, you can see that I'm trying to make a cube follow the player's camera for a prop pickup plugin. This means that my order must be:\r\n\r\n- Read player input\r\n- Update camera `Transform`\r\n- Update physics\r\n\r\nUpdating the camera transform in `FixedPreUpdate` would make it run fewer times than the refresh rate allows, which is something one should avoid with cameras.\r\nReading the input in `PreUpdate` definitely works (if you order stuff correctly), but updating the camera there would be quite the antipattern imo.
