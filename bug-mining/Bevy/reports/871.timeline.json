What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nAs described in the docs for `Trigger::entity`, observers can be triggered by a specific entity, or by no specific entity at all.\n\nRather than returning and storing an `Option` here, we use `Entity::PLACEHOLDER`.\n\nThis is unidiomatic and unclear, and makes it very hard to robustly handle this case.\nIn Rust, `Option` or other enums is the correct way to handle this, not special-cased values.\n\nThis is especially true since `Option<Entity>` is niched and doesn't even take up any additional memory.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nReplace all uses of `Entity::PLACEHOLDER` in observers code with an `Option<Entity>`.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nWe could use a custom enum here instead, but I think

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nWhile the `Event` trait is required for both observers and buffered events, it's very uncommon to use a single event type as both an observer and a buffered event. \nThese are used differently and have distinct semantics, despite both representing .\n\nThis makes the API more challenging to understand, opens users up to footguns where they create `EventReader`s for observer events or send buffered events via targeting, and also causes false positives for potential linting tools that attempt to check for things like \"all `Event` types should have a `add_event` call\".\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nSplit the trait, keeping the `Event` trait name for buffered events, and `Signal` for observer events.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nWe could consider unifying the underlying implementations in some way, to allow for users to seamlessly choose between them. That would entail:\n\n1. Replicating all observer-events to buffered-events, which discards the information about what entity was targeted.\n2. Automatically sending all buffered-events to observers, targeting nothing.\n\nI don't think that this is particularly useful or clear, and has a non-trivial performance overhead. Given that I haven't seen users asking for this, and it can be easily manually implemented if it *is* desired, I don't think this is the right call.\n\n## Additional context\n\nI advocated for adding a marker trait for observer events [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10839#issuecomment-2125520070).

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nRight now, whether an observer is a listening globally or for triggers on specific entities is determined when it's added.\n\n```rust\n// this will create a global one\ncommands.spawn(Observer::new(listen_system))\n// this will create an entity specific one\ncommands.spawn(Observer::new(listen_system).with_entity(existing_id))\n```\n\nThis presents an issue when trying to cache and reuse an observer. There needs to be an entity to watch, but that may be something spawned during gameplay and not in `Startup` where you would create such an observer.\n\n```rust\n// In Startup\nlet observer_id = commands.spawn(Observer::new(listen_system)).id();\ncommands.insert_resource(MyObserver(observer_id));\n// In Update\nmy_observer_res.0.watch_entity(commands.spawn(/* ... */));\n```\n\nSince the Observer was created with no entities watched it will respond to events on everything, even after a specific entity to watch has been specified.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nAbility/requirement to explicitly specify an `Observer` is or isn't targeted/global. Perhaps some way to switch between the two on the same `Observer` after creation. Control over the despawn on empty rule.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nRight now a workaround is possible:\n\n```rust\n// In Startup\nlet dummy = commands.spawn_empty().id();\nlet observer_id = commands.spawn(Observer::new(listen_system).with_entity(dummy)).id();\ncommands.insert_resource(MyObserver(observer_id));\n```\n\nBut it's not obvious, ugly and it also \"disables\" the feature that observer is removed after it's watched entities reach zero. Not to mention you have to know the quirk that `Observer` created with no entities is \"global\" and that's something you can't even check by querying the

Objective\r\n\r\nCloses #19564.\r\n\r\nThe current `Event` trait looks like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait Event: Send + Sync + 'static {\r\n    type Traversal: Traversal<Self>;\r\n    const AUTO_PROPAGATE: bool = false;\r\n    \r\n    fn register_component_id(world: &mut World) -> ComponentId { ... }\r\n    fn component_id(world: &World) -> Option<ComponentId> { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `Event` trait is used by both buffered events (`EventReader`/`EventWriter`) and observer events. If they are observer events, they can optionally be targeted at specific `Entity`s or `ComponentId`s, and can even be propagated to other entities.\r\n\r\nHowever, there has long been a desire to split the trait semantically for a variety of reasons, see #14843, #14272, and #16031 for discussion. Some reasons include:\r\n\r\n- It's very uncommon to use a single event type as both a buffered event and targeted observer event. They are used differently and tend to have distinct semantics.\r\n- A common footgun is using buffered events with observers or event readers with observer events, as there is no type-level error that prevents this kind of misuse.\r\n- #19440 made `Trigger::target` return an `Option<Entity>`. This *seriously* hurts ergonomics for the general case of entity observers, as you need to `.unwrap()` each time. If we could statically determine whether the event is expected to have an entity target, this would be unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThere's really two main ways that we can categorize events: push vs. pull (i.e. \"observer event\" vs. \"buffered event\") and global vs. targeted:\r\n\r\n|              | Push            | Pull                        |\r\n| ------------ | --------------- | --------------------------- |\r\n| **Global**   | Global observer | `EventReader`/`EventWriter` |\r\n| **Targeted** | Entity observer | -                           |\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to approach this, each with their tradeoffs. Ultimately, we kind of want to split events both ways:\r\n\r\n- A type-level distinction between observer events and buffered events, to prevent people from using the wrong kind of event in APIs\r\n- A statically designated entity target for observer events to avoid accidentally using untargeted events for targeted APIs\r\n\r\nThis PR achieves these goals by splitting event traits into `Event`, `EntityEvent`, and `BufferedEvent`, with `Event` being the shared trait implemented by all events.\r\n\r\n## `Event`, `EntityEvent`, and `BufferedEvent`\r\n\r\n`Event` is now a very simple trait shared by all events.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait Event: Send + Sync + 'static {\r\n    // Required for observer APIs\r\n    fn register_component_id(world: &mut World) -> ComponentId { ... }\r\n    fn component_id(world: &World) -> Option<ComponentId> { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can call `trigger` for *any* event, and use a global observer for listening to the event.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Event)]\r\nstruct Speak {\r\n    message: String,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\napp.add_observer(|trigger: On<Speak>| {\r\n    println!(\"{}\", trigger.message);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\ncommands.trigger(Speak {\r\n    message: \"Y'all like these reworked events?\".to_string(),\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo allow an event to be targeted at entities and even propagated further, you can additionally implement the `EntityEvent` trait:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait EntityEvent: Event {\r\n    type Traversal: Traversal<Self>;\r\n    const AUTO_PROPAGATE: bool = false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis lets you call `trigger_targets`, and to use targeted observer APIs like `EntityCommands::observe`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Event, EntityEvent)]\r\n#[entity_event(traversal = &'static ChildOf, auto_propagate)]\r\nstruct Damage {\r\n    amount: f32,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nlet enemy = commands.spawn((Enemy, Health(100.0))).id();\r\n\r\n// Spawn some armor as a child of the enemy entity.\r\n// When the armor takes damage, it will bubble the event up to the enemy.\r\nlet armor_piece = commands\r\n    .spawn((ArmorPiece, Health(25.0), ChildOf(enemy)))\r\n    .observe(|trigger: On<Damage>, mut query: Query<&mut Health>| {\r\n        // Note: `On::target` only exists because this is an `EntityEvent`.\r\n        let mut health = query.get(trigger.target()).unwrap();\r\n        health.0 -= trigger.amount();\r\n    });\r\n\r\ncommands.trigger_targets(Damage { amount: 10.0 }, armor_piece);\r\n```\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> You *can* still also trigger an `EntityEvent` without targets using `trigger`. We probably *could* make this an either-or thing, but I'm not sure that's actually desirable.\r\n\r\nTo allow an event to be used with the buffered API, you can implement `BufferedEvent`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait BufferedEvent: Event {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe event can then be used with `EventReader`/`EventWriter`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Event, BufferedEvent)]\r\nstruct Message(String);\r\n\r\nfn write_hello(mut writer: EventWriter<Message>) {\r\n    writer.write(Message(\"I hope these examples are alright\".to_string()));\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn read_messages(mut reader: EventReader<Message>) {\r\n    // Process all buffered events of type `Message`.\r\n    for Message(message) in reader.read() {\r\n        println!(\"{message}\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n\r\n- Need a basic event you can trigger and observe? Derive `Event`!\r\n- Need the event to be targeted at an entity? Derive `EntityEvent`!\r\n- Need the event to be buffered and support the `EventReader`/`EventWriter` API? Derive `BufferedEvent`!\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\nI'll now cover some of the alternative approaches I have considered and briefly explored. I made this section collapsible since it ended up being quite long :P\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Expand this to see alternatives</summary>\r\n\r\n### 1. Unified `Event` Trait\r\n\r\nOne option is not to have *three* separate traits (`Event`, `EntityEvent`, `BufferedEvent`), and to instead just use associated constants on `Event` to determine whether an event supports targeting and buffering or not:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait Event: Send + Sync + 'static {\r\n    type Traversal: Traversal<Self>;\r\n    const AUTO_PROPAGATE: bool = false;\r\n    const TARGETED: bool = false;\r\n    const BUFFERED: bool = false;\r\n    \r\n    fn register_component_id(world: &mut World) -> ComponentId { ... }\r\n    fn component_id(world: &World) -> Option<ComponentId> { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMethods can then use bounds like `where E: Event<TARGETED = true>` or `where E: Event<BUFFERED = true>` to limit APIs to specific kinds of events.\r\n\r\nThis would keep everything under one `Event` trait, but I don't think it's necessarily a good idea. It makes APIs harder to read, and docs can't easily refer to specific types of events. You can also create weird invariants: what if you specify `TARGETED = false`, but have `Traversal` and/or `AUTO_PROPAGATE` enabled?\r\n\r\n### 2. `Event` and `Trigger`\r\n\r\nAnother option is to only split the traits between buffered events and observer events, since that is the main thing people have been asking for, and they have the largest API difference.\r\n\r\nIf we did this, I think we would need to make the terms *clearly* separate. We can't really use `Event` and `BufferedEvent` as the names, since it would be strange that `BufferedEvent` doesn't implement `Event`. Something like `ObserverEvent` and `BufferedEvent` could work, but it'd be more verbose.\r\n\r\nFor this approach, I would instead keep `Event` for the current `EventReader`/`EventWriter` API, and call the observer event a `Trigger`, since the \"trigger\" terminology is already used in the observer context within Bevy (both as a noun and a verb). This is also what a long [bikeshed on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/749335865876021248/1298057661878898791)  seemed to land on at the end of last year.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// For `EventReader`/`EventWriter`\r\npub trait Event: Send + Sync + 'static {}\r\n\r\n// For observers\r\npub trait Trigger: Send + Sync + 'static {\r\n    type Traversal: Traversal<Self>;\r\n    const AUTO_PROPAGATE: bool = false;\r\n    const TARGETED: bool = false;\r\n    \r\n    fn register_component_id(world: &mut World) -> ComponentId { ... }\r\n    fn component_id(world: &World) -> Option<ComponentId> { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that \"event\" is just a really good term for something that \"happens\". Observers are rapidly becoming the more prominent API, so it'd be weird to give them the `Trigger` name and leave the good `Event` name for the less common API.\r\n\r\nSo, even though a split like this seems neat on the surface, I think it ultimately wouldn't really work. We want to keep the `Event` name for observer events, and there is no good alternative for the buffered variant. (`Message` was suggested, but saying stuff like \"sends a collision message\" is weird.)\r\n\r\n### 3. `GlobalEvent` + `TargetedEvent`\r\n\r\nWhat if instead of focusing on the buffered vs. observed split, we *only* make a distinction between global and targeted events?\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// A shared event trait to allow global observers to work\r\npub trait Event: Send + Sync + 'static {\r\n    fn register_component_id(world: &mut World) -> ComponentId { ... }\r\n    fn component_id(world: &World) -> Option<ComponentId> { ... }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// For buffered events and non-targeted observer events\r\npub trait GlobalEvent: Event {}\r\n\r\n// For targeted observer events\r\npub trait TargetedEvent: Event {\r\n    type Traversal: Traversal<Self>;\r\n    const AUTO_PROPAGATE: bool = false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is actually the first approach I implemented, and it has the neat characteristic that you can only use non-targeted APIs like `trigger` with a `GlobalEvent` and targeted APIs like `trigger_targets` with a `TargetedEvent`. You have full control over whether the entity should or should not have a target, as they are fully distinct at the type-level.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's a few problems:\r\n\r\n- There is no type-level indication of whether a `GlobalEvent` supports buffered events or just non-targeted observer events\r\n- An `Event` on its own does literally nothing, it's just a shared trait required to make global observers accept both non-targeted and targeted events\r\n- If an event is both a `GlobalEvent` and `TargetedEvent`, global observers again have ambiguity on whether an event has a target or not, undermining some of the benefits\r\n- The names are not ideal\r\n\r\n### 4. `Event` and `EntityEvent`\r\n\r\nWe can fix some of the problems of Alternative 3 by accepting that targeted events can also be used in non-targeted contexts, and simply having the `Event` and `EntityEvent` traits:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// For buffered events and non-targeted observer events\r\npub trait Event: Send + Sync + 'static {\r\n    fn register_component_id(world: &mut World) -> ComponentId { ... }\r\n    fn component_id(world: &World) -> Option<ComponentId> { ... }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// For targeted observer events\r\npub trait EntityEvent: Event {\r\n    type Traversal: Traversal<Self>;\r\n    const AUTO_PROPAGATE: bool = false;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is essentially identical to this PR, just without a dedicated `BufferedEvent`. The remaining major \"problem\" is that there is still zero type-level indication of whether an `Event` event *actually* supports the buffered API. This leads us to the solution proposed in this PR, using `Event`, `EntityEvent`, and `BufferedEvent`.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe `Event` + `EntityEvent` + `BufferedEvent` split proposed in this PR aims to solve all the common problems with Bevy's current event model while keeping the \"weirdness\" factor minimal. It splits in terms of both the push vs. pull *and* global vs. targeted aspects, while maintaining a shared concept for an \"event\".\r\n\r\n### Why I Like This\r\n\r\n- The term \"event\" remains as a single concept for all the different kinds of events in Bevy.\r\n- Despite all event types being \"events\", they use fundamentally different APIs. Instead of assuming that you can use an event type with any pattern (when only one is typically supported), you explicitly opt in to each one with dedicated traits.\r\n- Using separate traits for each type of event helps with documentation and clearer function signatures.\r\n- I can safely make assumptions on expected usage.\r\n\t- If I see that an event is an `EntityEvent`, I can assume that I can use `observe` on it and get targeted events.\r\n\t- If I see that an event is a `BufferedEvent`, I can assume that I can use `EventReader` to read events.\r\n\t- If I see both `EntityEvent` and `BufferedEvent`, I can assume that both APIs are supported.\r\n\r\nIn summary: This allows for a unified concept for events, while limiting the different ways to use them with opt-in traits. No more guess-work involved when using APIs.\r\n\r\n### Problems?\r\n\r\n- Because `BufferedEvent` implements `Event` (for more consistent semantics etc.), you can still use all buffered events for non-targeted observers. I think this is fine/good. The important part is that if you see that an event implements `BufferedEvent`, you know that the `EventReader`/`EventWriter` API should be supported. Whether it *also* supports other APIs is secondary.\r\n- I currently only support `trigger_targets` for an `EntityEvent`. However, you can technically target components too, without targeting any entities. I consider that such a niche and advanced use case that it's not a huge problem to only support it for `EntityEvent`s, but we could also split `trigger_targets` into `trigger_entities` and `trigger_components` if we wanted to (or implement components as entities :P).\r\n- You can still trigger an `EntityEvent` *without* targets. I consider this correct, since `Event` implements the non-targeted behavior, and it'd be weird if implementing another trait *removed* behavior. However, it does mean that global observers for entity events can technically return `Entity::PLACEHOLDER` again (since I got rid of the `Option<Entity>` added in #19440 for ergonomics). I think that's enough of an edge case that it's not a huge problem, but it is worth keeping in mind.\r\n- ~~Deriving both `EntityEvent` and `BufferedEvent` for the same type currently duplicates the `Event` implementation, so you instead need to manually implement one of them.~~ Changed to always requiring `Event` to be derived.\r\n\r\n## Related Work\r\n\r\nThere are plans to implement multi-event support for observers, especially for UI contexts. [Cart's example](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14649#issuecomment-2960402508) API looked like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Truncated for brevity\r\ntrigger: Trigger<(\r\n    OnAdd<Pressed>,\r\n    OnRemove<Pressed>,\r\n    OnAdd<InteractionDisabled>,\r\n    OnRemove<InteractionDisabled>,\r\n    OnInsert<Hovered>,\r\n)>,\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this shouldn't be in conflict with this PR. If anything, this PR might *help* achieve the multi-event pattern for entity observers with fewer footguns: by statically enforcing that all of these events are `EntityEvent`s in the context of `EntityCommands::observe`, we can avoid misuse or weird cases where *some* events inside the trigger are targeted while others are not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19647/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19647/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18158001187,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U866q_LvzwAAAAQ6TRwj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18158001187","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"38c3423693f7d6f3bfe71d8732c246b270b61a4f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/38c3423693f7d6f3bfe71d8732c246b270b61a4f","created_at":"2025-06-15T17:10:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18158001213,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U866q_LvzwAAAAQ6TRw9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18158001213","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-15T17:10:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18159250531,"node_id":"PVTISC_lADODf6-U866q_LvzwAAAAQ6YCxj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18159250531","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"project_v2_item_status_changed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-15T20:55:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
