Naturally the best approach would be to stop parsing the manifest at all (which we do to determine whether our derive macros should use the `bevy::ecs` path or the `bevy_ecs` path).\n\nIn an ideal world, we could just do `if cfg!(dependency = \"bevy\") {}`, but that is not possible (at least, not yet).\n\nI've found a solution, but it will involve more per-macro boilerplate (and dirtier module re-exports for the top-level bevy crate).

So far I haven't found alternatives other than the static approach listed above (which has enough tradeoffs that I'd prefer not to).\n\nHopefully eventually Rust [solves this problem upstream](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54363#issuecomment-1236685409). The approach used by `proc-macro-crate` (which is fundamentally what we are doing as well) is a nasty hack, not something the Rust community should be satisfied with.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2705365210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16625686464,"node_id":"MEE_lADODf6-U86sMb94zwAAAAPe99fA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16625686464","actor":{"login":"h3r2tic","id":16522064,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTIyMDY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16522064?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic","html_url":"https://github.com/h3r2tic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-07T02:18:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16625686472,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86sMb94zwAAAAPe99fI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16625686472","actor":{"login":"h3r2tic","id":16522064,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTIyMDY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16522064?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic","html_url":"https://github.com/h3r2tic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h3r2tic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-07T02:18:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2705372340","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18103#issuecomment-2705372340","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18103","id":2705372340,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86hQLS0","user":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-07T02:25:36Z","updated_at":"2025-03-07T02:25:36Z","body":"I
