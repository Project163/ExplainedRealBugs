However, exporting `CursorIcon` means that the abstraction leaks: anyone who uses cursors is now tied to a particular windowing backend.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nWe need to have a universal `Cursor` definition that is independent of any particular windowing system.\n\nNow, it might seem a challenge to do this because the existing `CursorIcon` has a bunch of built-in \"standard\" cursors which might not be present on other windowing backends. However, the built-in winit cursors are exactly the same as the standard CSS browser cursors (or at least, a subset of them), so there's a good chance that any other windowing system will support a similar set of cursors; and if not, we can probably emulate them to bring the various platforms up to par.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nWell, the main alternative is to assume that we're always and forever going to be using winit as the backend. But this probably isn't going to fly.\n\nEither that, or simply disable custom cursors in other environments.","closed_by":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
