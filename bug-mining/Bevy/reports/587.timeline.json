We might be able to get rid of these `OnceLock`s completely now that `const` is more powerful.

a follow-up.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @chescock in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/16758#discussion_r1887633983_\r\n\r\nAfter testing, making `Access::read_all_resources` and `Access::write_all_resources` `const` is simple, and the following code replaces the `static` with a `const`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nconst READ_ALL_RESOURCES: &'static Access<ComponentId> = {\r\n    const ACCESS: Access<ComponentId> = {\r\n        let mut access = Access::new();\r\n        access.read_all_resources();\r\n        access\r\n    };\r\n    &ACCESS\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe nested `const` is required to reassure the compiler that `Access` isn't dropped within a `const` context (it doesn't want to run the non-trivial `drop` implementation)\r\n
