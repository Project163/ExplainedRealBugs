Objective\r\nFixes #21482\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nBefore exiting the system when the controller is disabled, check if either of the cursor grab flags are set and ungrab any windows if so.\r\nNote: I think it's a bit strange that the camera un-grabs every window, not just the one with focus, but I've just copied this behaviour from further down in the function. In this case, it might be more correct to do this anyway, since the controller might be disabled when the respective window isn't focused.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI used #21477 to test this\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21485/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20212558841,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U87Qoq_HzwAAAAS0wyv5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20212558841","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fef6b51d592763c528e7c46726507213e3d6d4ca","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/fef6b51d592763c528e7c46726507213e3d6d4ca","created_at":"2025-10-10T16:41:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20212560214,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U87Qoq_HzwAAAAS0wzFW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20212560214","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-10T16:41:33Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20442201536,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U87Qoq_HzwAAAATCcz3A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20442201536","actor":{"login":"mate-h","id":14351670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzUxNjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14351670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h","html_url":"https://github.com/mate-h","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7b68866b3c7e508293df0e7dd9d0f57c696cd8eb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mate-h/bevy/commits/7b68866b3c7e508293df0e7dd9d0f57c696cd8eb","created_at":"2025-10-22T23:42:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
