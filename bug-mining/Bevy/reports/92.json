However, our `css` palette now conforms to the [css4 spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#named-colors). In the css4 spec, dark gray is lighter than gray.\r\n\r\nThis is causing very low contrast in some of these examples.\r\n\r\nWe should search for usages of `DARK_GR[EA]Y` and replace them with a darker gray.\r\n\r\nThis is the old one:\r\n\r\n```\r\npub const DARK_GRAY: LegacyColor = LegacyColor::rgb(0.25, 0.25, 0.25);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no good replacement gray in the palette, so I recommend using `Color::rgb(0.25, 0.25, 0.25)`.","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12226/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12226/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
