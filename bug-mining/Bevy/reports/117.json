Ideally a window could be hidden from the taskbar and tabbing so as to not pollute either with widgets, mouse-following objects, and other, perhaps high-concept, uses for multiple windows. The major sticking point currently is a lack of method on `Window` at even the `WinitWindows` level to skip taskbar, or at least the underlying `WindowExtWindows` is not exposed well enough.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nwinit's `WindowBuilderExtWindows` has a chainable `with_skip_taskbar(bool)`. Exposing this during bevy's window creation would be handy. `WindowExtWindows` also has `set_skip_taskbar(bool)` but it's not exposed I suppose due to platform exclusivity. I wouldn't expect a use case for toggling the taskbar visibility, so just the on-creation method should be enough for now.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nThe alternative for my applications is a multi-monitor-spanning giga-window that everything renders to and handling all windows internally, but multiple monitors get tricky in bevy too.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nSimilar in scope to #9433, this is just exposing existing platform-specific winit features.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12431/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
