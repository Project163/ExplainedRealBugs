Objective\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #21569, which proposes renaming the newly introduced camera controller modules `FreeCam` and `PanCam` to use the full term `Camera`. \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n* Renamed the `PanCam` controller, `PanCamPlugin`, and related methods to use the full term `Camera` instead of the abbreviation `Cam`.\r\n* Renamed the module from `pan_cam` to `pan_camera` for consistency with naming conventions.\r\n* Updated the example `pan_camera_controller` and adjusted usage of the renamed controller and plugin.\r\n* Updated documentation and release notes accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Follow-up Work\r\n\r\nI see two options from here:\r\n\r\n1. **Use this PR as a reference** for renaming `FreeCam`. The process is similar and could be a great first issue for someone looking to contribute to the new camera modules or Bevy in general. Most of the changes follow the same pattern, although `FreeCam` has more examples that need updating.
