If you hover over any of the clipped nodes you'll see that the outline only wraps the visible section of the node\r\n\r\n### Outlines are clipped incorrectly\r\n\r\nA UI nodes Outline's are drawn outside of its bounds, so applying the local clipping rect to the outline doesn't make any sense.\r\nInstead an `Outline` should be clipped using its parent's clipping rect.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n* Pass the `point` value into the vertex shader instead of calculating it in the shader.\r\n* In `extract_uinode_borders` use the parents clipping rect when clipping outlines.\r\n\r\nThe extra parameter isn't a great solution I think, but I wanted to fix borders for the 0.15 release and this is the most minimal approach I could think of without replacing the whole shader and prepare function. \r\n\r\n ## Showcase\r\n\r\n<img width=\"149\" alt=\"clipp\"
