The `path` variable can be traced back to `file_path` in `AssetPlugin` which is relative to the project root. And as you have pointed out all the other places that uses this same path appends it to `get_base_path`. \n\nIt was introduced in #13902, and I can see why it wasn't obvious from context. It's pretty error prone that the path is relative to some other folder until it hits that constructor, while just being named

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #16879\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nMoved the construction of the root path of the assets folder out of `FileWatcher::new()` and into `source.rs`, as the path is checked there with `path.exists()` and fails in certain configurations eg., virtual workspaces.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nApplied fix to a private fork and tested against both standard project setups and virtual workspaces. Works without issue on both. Have tested under macOS and Arch Linux.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16958/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16958/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15778001472,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86jtwpUzwAAAAOscTJA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15778001472","actor":{"login":"Shatur","id":22453358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDUzMzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22453358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shatur","html_url":"https://github.com/Shatur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shatur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shatur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shatur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shatur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shatur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shatur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shatur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shatur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shatur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-28T17:55:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15780588119,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86jtwpUzwAAAAOsmKpX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15780588119","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2dcf6bcfd74b2ed49a189b79eefc2f32eb6da90c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/2dcf6bcfd74b2ed49a189b79eefc2f32eb6da90c","created_at":"2024-12-29T20:01:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15780588142,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86jtwpUzwAAAAOsmKpu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15780588142","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-29T20:01:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15810100806,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86jtwpUzwAAAAOuWv5G","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15810100806","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_u
