Ordinarily, this inserts them with their default value.\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Component)]\n#[require(\n    LockedAxes(||LockedAxes::ROTATION_LOCKED),\n)]\npub struct CharacterController;\n```\n\nIf we want to override that, we can pass any function which takes no argument, and returns the appropriate component type.\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Component)]\n#[require(\n    LockedAxes(||LockedAxes::ROTATION_LOCKED),\n)]\npub struct CharacterController;\n```\n\nHowever, this is verbose / frustrating when working with constants.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nUsers should be able to pass in a constant, like so:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Component)]\n#[require(\n  LockedAxes::ROTATION_LOCKED,\n)]\npub struct CharacterController;\n```\n\nI suspect that we'll need to generate a closure that constructs the constant, but I haven't looked closely at the code here. We will need to require `Clone` unless we're storing a closure.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nIf, for macro reasons, we absolutely need to pass in the type before the constructor, we could do:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Component)]\n#[require(\n    LockedAxes(LockedAxes::ROTATION_LOCKED),\n)]\npub struct CharacterController;\n```\n\n## Additional context\n\nWe might also want to provide helpers for doing this for dynamically registered components.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16720/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
