Objective\r\n\r\nSupport the parametrization of the WS_CLIPCHILDREN style on Windows.\r\n\r\nFixes #16544\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdded a window configuration in bevy_winit to control the usage of the WS_CLIPCHILDREN style.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Did you test these changes? If so, how?\r\nI did. I was able to create a Wry Webview with a transparent HTML document and was also able to see my Bevy scene behind the webview elements.\r\n\r\n- Are there any parts that need more testing?\r\n I don't believe so. I assume the option is extensively tested within winit itself.\r\n\r\n- How can other people (reviewers) test your changes? Is there anything specific they need to know?\r\nTest repositiory [here](https://github.com/nicholasc/bevy_wry_test). Bevy's path will need to be updated in the Cargo.toml\r\n\r\n- If relevant, what platforms did you test these changes on, and are there any important ones you can't test?\r\nThis is a Windows specific issue. Should be tested

Describe the bug\n\nIm trying to embed the tauri webview into my experimental bevy project. I've managed to make the tauri spawn a child window in the bevy window, but the `WebviewWindowBuilder::transparent` does not correctly make the it transparent. What I've imagining is to have the tauri as a transparent overlay on top of bevy render, but the result is either\n\n* When `transparent(false) / not set`\n\nThe webview background is pure white.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38f68d81-33f7-4b54-8d43-c6fbe4a7eb3f)\n\n* When `transparent(true)`\n\nThe webview background is visually pure black.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f686928-6f38-4ca1-b101-aa1548aba408)\n\nI've set the css bgc for whole html element to be `#0000`, and the inspector does say the color is `#0000`. But it's not actually letting things behind to pass-through.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/625b4c53-253d-4dcb-b951-2d4cb0a05701)\n\nIf remove the parenting, the transparency worked as expected, but the `bevy` window and `tauri` window are now independent and way harder to manage.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea076c6d-441a-493a-8f8e-e59d8b96bada)\n\nIs there anything I overlooked?\n\n\n\n### Reproduction\n\n1. Create a empty tauri project.\n\n2. CD into `src-tauri`, `cargo add` both `bevy` and `wry`.\n\n3. Paste following code into lib.rs\n\n```rs\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\nuse bevy::winit::WinitWindows;\nuse bevy::window::PrimaryWindow;\nuse wry::raw_window_handle::{HasWindowHandle, RawWindowHandle};\n\n\n#[cfg_attr(mobile, tauri::mobile_entry_point)]\npub fn run() {\n  App::new()\n    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n    .add_systems(PostStartup, init_tauri)\n    .run();\n}\n\n\nfn init_tauri(\n  winit_windows: NonSend<WinitWindows>,\n  window: Single<Entity, With<PrimaryWindow>>,\n) {\n  let window = winit_windows\n    .get_window(window.into_inner())\n    .unwrap();\n\n  let RawWindowHandle::Win32(handle) = window.window_handle().unwrap().as_raw()\n    else { println!(\"not windows window\"); return; };\n\n  let tmp = handle.hwnd;\n\n  std::thread::spawn(move || {\n    tauri::Builder::default()\n      .plugin(tauri_plugin_opener::init())\n      .any_thread()\n      .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![])\n      .setup(move |app| {\n        use tauri::*;\n\n        WebviewWindowBuilder::new(app, \"main\", WebviewUrl::App(\"index.html\".into()))\n          .parent_raw(unsafe { std::mem::transmute(tmp) })\n          .inner_size(300., 200.)\n          .decorations(false)\n          .transparent(true)     // not working as expected\n          .position(0., 0.)\n          .shadow(false)\n          .resizable(false)\n          .closable(false)\n          .build()?;\n\n        Ok(())\n      })\n      .run(tauri::generate_context!())\n      .expect(\"error while running tauri application\");\n  });\n}\n```\n\n4. Add any html for testing and make sure the `background-color` property is set to something transparent.\n\nMine:\n\n```html\n// `app.html`\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%sveltekit.assets%/favicon.png\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n    <title>Tauri + SvelteKit + Typescript App</title>\n    %sveltekit.head%\n    <style> html { background-color: #0000; } </style>\n  </head>\n  <body data-sveltekit-preload-data=\"hover\">\n    <div style=\"display: contents\">%sveltekit.body%</div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n```html\n// the root `+page.svelte`\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n\n</script>\n\n\n<div>\n  <h1>Page</h1>\n  <p>This is a page</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<style lang=\"scss\">\n  div {\n    background-color: white;\n  }\n</style>\n```\n\n5. `npm tauri dev`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe embeded child window should be transparent and letting the things behind to be visible in the viewport.\n\n### Full `tauri info` output\n\n```text\n> the-world@0.1.0 tauri\n> tauri info\n\n\n[✔] Environment\n    - OS: Windows 10.0.26100 x86_64

the bug**\n\nI'm implementing WRY into a Godot Engine project, and enabling transparency does not work as expected on Windows.\n\nThe webview background shows a dark grey background rather than displaying the underlying game content. If I set my Godot project settings to enable the window to be transparent, it displays the desktop instead of the underlying game.\n\nI think this suggests that the webview is rendering on the same \"layer\" as the game, thus not rendering the game underneath it, instead of rendering \"on top\" of the game or as an \"overlay\". So it could be an issue related to z-ordering, maybe?\n\nI tested this on Mac, and the webview renders perfectly fine with transparency on top of the game.\n\n**Steps To Reproduce**\n\nYou can find the WRY implementation for Godot I'm building on [this repo here](https://github.com/doceazedo/godot_wry/blob/main/rust/src/lib.rs#L98).\n\n1. Create a new Godot 4.2 project.\n2. Import \"Godot WRY\" from the asset lib.\n3. Open the scene inside \"addons/godot_wry/examples/character_creator_ui_demo/character_creator.gd\"\n4. Run the current scene\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe webview should be rendered with transparency on top of the game.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\nWebview with transparency enabled:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c5f02d5-80b8-483f-8b6a-2b8873922220)\n\nWebview with transparency enable, with transparent Godot window:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b12d362f-75c2-4014-840e-31b95204fe0f)\n\nWebview with transparency enabled, working as expected on Mac:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae6ef7ab-3195-4af0-8480-3a254f834b52)\n\n**Platform and Versions:**\nOS: Windows 11 Pro 24H2\nRustc: rustc 1.86.0 (05f9846f8 2025-03-31)\n\n**Additional context**\n\nEscalated from doceazedo/godot_wry#15","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/wry/issues/1540/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tauri-apps/wry/issues/1540/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
