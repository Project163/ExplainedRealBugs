Objective\r\n\r\n- The StandardMaterial always uses ATTRIBUTE_UV_0 for each texture except lightmap. This is not flexible enough for a lot of gltf Files.\r\n- Fixes #12496\r\n- Fixes #13086\r\n- Fixes #13122\r\n- Closes #13153\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- The StandardMaterial gets extended for each texture by an UvChannel enum. It defaults to Uv0 but can also be set to Uv1.\r\n- The gltf loader now handles the texcoord information. If the texcoord is not supported it creates a warning.\r\n- It uses StandardMaterial shader defs to define which attribute to use.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThis fixes #12496 for example:\r\n![wall_fixed](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/688816/bc37c9e1-72ba-4e59-b092-5ee10dade603)\r\n\r\nFor testing of all kind of textures I used the TextureTransformMultiTest from https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Assets/tree/main/Models/TextureTransformMultiTest\r\nIts purpose is to test multiple texture transfroms but it is also a good test for different texcoords.\r\nIt also shows the issue with emission #13133.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![TextureTransformMultiTest_main](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/688816/aa701d04-5a3f-4df1-a65f-fc770ab6f4ab)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![TextureTransformMultiTest_texcoord](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/688816/c3f91943-b830-4068-990f-e4f2c97771ee)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13200/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13200/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2093444243","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13133#issuecomment-2093444243","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13133","id":2093444243,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U858x2yT","user":{"login":"fintelia","id":4943209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDMyMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4943209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fintelia","html_url":"https://github.com/fintelia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fintelia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fintelia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fintelia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fintelia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fintelia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fintelia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fintelia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fintelia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fintelia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-03T17:17:49Z","updated_at":"2024-05-03T17:17:49Z","body":"The default exposure is tuned so that point lights and directional lights match Blender.
