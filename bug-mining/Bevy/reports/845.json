(Got the code from some example I think)\n\n```rust\nlet mut bevy_mesh = Mesh::new(\n    PrimitiveTopology::TriangleList,\n    RenderAssetUsages::RENDER_WORLD,\n);\nbevy_mesh.insert_attribute(Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_POSITION, positions);\n...\ncommands\n   .spawn((\n        Name::new(primitive.name.to_string()),\n        Mesh3d(meshes.add(bevy_mesh)),\n        ...\n```\n\nEverything seemed to be rendered correctly but to my surprise picking was only working for bevy primitives and not for my meshes. After quite some searching I found out that I need to set the asset_usage to \n```rust\nRenderAssetUsages::MAIN_WORLD | RenderAssetUsages::RENDER_WORLD\n// or\nRenderAssetUsages::default()\n```\n to be able to pick the mesh.\n\nDocumenting that `RenderAssetUsages::MAIN_WORLD` requirement would have saved me a lot of time.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
