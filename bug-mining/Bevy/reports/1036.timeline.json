Background\n\n@aevyrie's [bevy_editor_cam](https://github.com/aevyrie/bevy_editor_cam) is a high quality, editor/CAD focused camera crate.\n\nThe Bevy Editor will need one of these, and after some [prototyping](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy_editor_prototypes) work, I'm confident that this is an excellent base for what we're going to need. There's no need to NIH, when we can instead EEE ;)\n\nBecause we intend to keep the Bevy Editor source code inside of the `bevyengine/bevy` repo, and keep it up to date with `main`, we cannot rely on external crates which depend on Bevy itself due to circular dependencies and synchronization challenges.\n\n## Proposal\n\nGiven this confidence, I think we should upstream this crate now. Even before we have an official Bevy Editor, having a polished first-part editor camera crate will:\n\n1. Provide the basis for simpler tools, such as a toggleable fly camera for inspecting the scene while the game is paused.\n2. Be very helpful in examples, by allowing us to reduce boilerplate and improve the ability for users to navigate the scene using a consistent set of controls.\n3. Be generally useful to end users building tooling, CAD-style software or even some forms of games.\n\n## Implementation strategy\n\n1. Create a PR adding a new `bevy_editor_camera` crate, clearly crediting @aevyrie and the original crate. There will be a small amount of work required to get it compiling, but no other changes should be made in that PR.\n2. Create a PR or three to use this in our example code and remove existing camera controller code. As part of this, we should add a `ExampleCameraControlerPlugin`, which hard-codes various inputs in a standardized way.\n3. Create follow-up PRs to fix bugs, improve docs and so on in the ordinary fashion.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19741/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":12,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19741/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3398984576","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21456#issuecomment-3398984576","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21456","id":3398984576,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U87KmGOA","user":{"login":"syszery","id":66296529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2Mjk2NTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66296529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery","html_url":"https://github.com/syszery","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-13T20:34:47Z","updated_at":"2025-10-13T20:34:47Z","body":"After working on the new `bevy_camera_controller` crate, I would like to continue with this refactor.

Objective\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the `FreeCam` controller to improve its modularity and flexibility. Happy to adjust based on feedback or suggestions!\r\n\r\nFixes #21456\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n* **Splits the `FreeCam` system into two components**:\r\n  * `FreeCam`: Stores the **configuration** of the camera controller, including key bindings, movement speeds, and sensitivity. This struct is immutable during runtime, ensuring that the core settings stay consistent.\r\n  * `FreeCamState`: Manages the **dynamic runtime state** of the camera, such as the current pitch, yaw, velocity, and speed multiplier. This component allows for real-time adjustments to camera behavior without altering the original settings.\r\n* **Improves the example for debugging and testing**:\r\n  A simplified example (`free_cam_simple`) has been introduced, allowing for easy testing and showcasing of the new FreeCam controller system.\r\n* **Fixes the bug with translation speed**:\r\n  As noted in #21483, the camera’s translation speed would \"stick\" after excessive scrolling. This bug was still present in the `free_cam_controller` example. Following the approach suggested in #21486, the bug has been resolved in the new `free_cam_simple` example (I did not yet verify the existing ones).\r\n* **Clarifies documentation**:\r\n  Documentation has been updated to reflect the new structure, clearly describing the roles of both `FreeCam` (static settings) and `FreeCamState` (dynamic state).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* For testing, I added a simple example `free_cam_simple` as a POC (this can be removed later if no longer needed).\r\n* Run with: `cargo run --example free_cam_simple --features=\"free_cam\"`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21538/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"syszery","id":66296529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2Mjk2NTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66296529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery","html_url":"https://github.com/syszery","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-14T11:13:18Z","updated_at":"2025-10-14T11:13:18Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21520","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21520/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21520/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21520/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/21520","id":3507783837,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86tWA6P","number":21520,"title":"feat(pan-cam): add scaffolding for 2D pan camera controller","user":{"login":"syszery","id":66296529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2Mjk2NTI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66296529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery","html_url":"https://github.com/syszery","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syszery/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Feature","name":"C-Feature","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A new feature, making something new possible"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Objective\r\n\r\nImplements scaffolding for a 2D pan camera controller.\r\n\r\nFixes #21468 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Introduced a `PanCam` component with settings for panning, zooming, and rotation via keyboard input, following the design of the existing `FreeCam`.\r\n- Added a `PanCamPlugin` to register the controller system.\r\n- Implemented keyboard-based panning and rotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODOs\r\n\r\n- Movement is currently world-axis aligned. \r\n  - TODO: Consider movement relative to camera rotation.\r\n- Zooming support is scaffolded with config fields but not yet implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I was unable to fully test this implementation due to issues running graphical output with GPU acceleration under WSL.  \r\nAs a
