Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #12139 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Derive `Debug` impl for `Entity`\r\n- Add impl `Display` for `Entity`\r\n- Add `entity_display` test to check the output contains all required info\r\n\r\nI decided to go with `0v0|1234` format as opposed to the `0v0[1234]` which was initially discussed in the issue.\r\n\r\nMy rationale for this is that `[1234]` may be confused for index values, which may be common in logs, and so searching for entities by text would become harder. I figured `|1234` would help the entity IDs stand out more.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I'm a little concerned that this change is gonna break existing logging for projects because `Debug` is now going to be a multi-line output. But maybe this is ok.\r\n\r\nWe could implement `Debug` to be a single-line output, but then I don't see why it would be different from `Display` at all.\r\n\r\n@alice-i-cecile Let me know if we'd like to make any changes based on these points.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12119975677,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86AdrFfzwAAAALSaCb9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12119975677","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7d816aab048098c686e427d68e524b597ae62c29","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/7d816aab048098c686e427d68e524b597ae62c29","created_at":"2024-03-14T15:13:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12119975929,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86AdrFfzwAAAALSaCf5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12119975929","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-14T15:13:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2241915791","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12139#issuecomment-2241915791","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12139","id":2241915791,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86FoOuP","user":{"login":"Zeenobit","id":12216742,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjE2NzQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12216742?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeenobit","html_url":"https://github.com/Zeenobit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeenobit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeenobit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeenobit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeenobit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeenobit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeenobit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeenobit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeenobit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeenobit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-22T02:15:18Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T02:16:35Z","body":"@alice-i-cecile I want to re-open this issue. I don't think the `fmt::Debug` and `fmt::Display` implementation we proposed in the discussions here actually solves the initial problem. Additionally, it introduces a new issue that I was originally concerned about.\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\nThe serialized output of Bevy scenes uses the raw bit representation of entities, i.e. `4294967303`.\r\nMany systems, including internal Bevy code, currently log entities using `fmt::Debug` (i.e. `{:?}`).\r\nThis is because previously, `fmt::Debug` has format `#v#`, which was short and concise, _but didn't include the raw bits_.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the `fmt::Debug` implementation is now derived. This means now any log that uses `{:?}` now displays:\r\n`Entity Entity { index: 16, generation: 3 } does not exist`\r\nUnless we retroactively fix existing log outputs, this is currently producing very ugly logs, not just for Bevy, but for everyone downstream!\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this still doesn't fix the initial problem, because `fmt::Debug` _still doesn't include the raw bits_.\r\nI can't easily map `Entity { index: 16, generation: 3 }` to `4294967303`.\r\n\r\n## My Proposal\r\nTo me, `Entity` should not have a `fmt::Display` implementation.\r\n99.9% of the time an entity is only being displaying for debug purposes.\r\nBecause of this, I propose `fmt::Debug` should be what `fmt::Display` is now, in addition to the raw bits: i.e. `#v#[rawbits]`\r\n\r\nThis not only avoids the need to retroactively fix logs, but also solves the initial problem _by including the raw bits_ into the debug output.\r\n\r\nAny specialized debugger that needs to show additional data for the entity most likely would need to format it explicitly. Trying to implement `fmt::Display` as a \"pretty debug\" output is not something I believe Bevy should handle.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe only other alternative I see around this issue is that we retroactively fix existing log locations to use `{}` instead of `{:?}` and include the raw bits where appropriate. To me, this is a much more intrusive
