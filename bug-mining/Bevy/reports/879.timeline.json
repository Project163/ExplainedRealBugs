Objective\r\n\r\n- Fix #19759 \r\n- The bigger permutation table only comes into play for higher dimensions than 1, when you start doing `PERMUTATION_TABLE[PERMUTATION_TABLE[index] + some_number]`\r\n  - The bigger permutation table has no mathematical meaning, it's just there to avoid having to write more `& 0xFF` when doing multiple nested lookups in higher dimensions\r\n- But we only use 1D Perlin noise for the camera shake because we want the dimensions to be uncorrelated\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- So, we can trim the permutation table down :) \r\n  - This should be mathematically identical, as a wrapped value will still access the same element as an unwrapped value would in the bigger table\r\n- The comment was a bit misleading anyways. \"mirror\" did not refer to \"mirrored values\" but to \"repeated values\". \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Ran the example. Still behaves like before.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19765/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18257532431,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U868oaQmzwAAAARAO9YP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18257532431","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d770648c2f7acc392370823ba97acea3e42d61d1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/d770648c2f7acc392370823ba97acea3e42d61d1","created_at":"2025-06-21T15:24:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18257532448,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U868oaQmzwAAAARAO9Yg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18257532448","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-21T15:24:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18573704345,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U868oaQmzwAAAARTFDyZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18573704345","actor":{"login":"Trashtalk217","id":24552941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTUyOTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24552941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trashtalk217","html_url":"https://github.com/Trashtalk217","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trashtalk217/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trashtalk217/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trashtalk217/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trashtalk217/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trashtalk217/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trashtalk217/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trashtalk217/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trashtalk217/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Trashtalk217/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"219f3d1de7ff7a9f4c8181024712b6dce6603592","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Trashtalk217/bevy/commits/219f3d1de7ff7a9f4c8181024712b6dce6603592","created_at":"2025-07-10T20:59:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
