I got some advice which cleared things up, and I now have the following suggestions for documentation improvements that could have helped me get the right idea from the start:\n\n* In <https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/0.16.0/bevy_ecs/schedule/trait.ScheduleLabel.html>, document that this trait has an accompanying derive macro, and give an example of using it. Right now, it's not clear how a user of `bevy_ecs` creates and uses a schedule label; the only implementor visible when looking at `bevy_ecs` (not `bevy`) is `Interned<dyn ScheduleLabel>`. (I had vaguely acquired the entirely wrong impression that schedule labels are auto-assigned IDs like `Entity`. I could have been reminded this was wrong by rereading normal `bevy` usage docs, but ideally `bevy_ecs` docs by themselves would suffice.)\n\n* In <https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/0.16.0/bevy_ecs/schedule/struct.Schedule.html> (the type documentation, not any specific function), add some sentences about how schedule labels relate to schedules.\n\n* In <https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/0.16.0/bevy_ecs/world/struct.World.html#method.run_schedule>, expand on the sentence “For simple testing use cases, call [Schedule::run(&mut world)](https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/0.16.0/bevy_ecs/schedule/struct.Schedule.html#method.run) instead.” with a rationale, perhaps, “This avoids the need to create a unique `ScheduleLabel`.”\n\n* In <https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/0.16.0/bevy_ecs/world/struct.World.html#method.add_schedule>, mention that if one's goal is to add systems that are organized into schedules, one might want to use <https://docs.rs/bevy_ecs/latest/bevy_ecs/schedule/struct.Schedules.html#method.add_systems>, as opposed to the naïve direct approach of calling `Schedule::new()` and working with that.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19270/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
