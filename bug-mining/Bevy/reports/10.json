Seems like there needs to be an Events<AssetError> or something to close the loop, since AssetEvent doesn't include error cases. Or just make AssetEvent include error cases.\r\n\r\n-[shaen on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/749332104487108618/1194423418762833973)\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nInclude the error modes directly in `AssetEvent` and send them when assets fail to load.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nMake a new event type specific to events. This is inferior because it creates two different streams to listen to for no good reason and makes it easy to simply fail to handle the error cases.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11288/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11288/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
