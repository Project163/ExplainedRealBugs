Bevy version\n\n`0.16.0-dev` (`#adbb53b8`)\n\n## What you did\n\nI ran the following code. It has a hierarchy of 3 cubes: a parent, a child and a grand-child. The parent cube moves up and down and so should the children since their transform is relative to their parent.\n\n- [Gist to the full code](https://gist.github.com/splo/4839ca84d8645bd4c3b9a39f5df2c159).\n- Relevant code:\n\n```rust\ncommands.spawn((\n    Name::new(\"Parent\"),\n    Transform::from_xyz(-1.5, 0.0, 0.0),\n    Movable,\n    children![(\n        Name::new(\"Child\"),\n        Transform::from_xyz(1.5, 0.0, 0.0),\n        children![(\n            Name::new(\"Grand-child\"),\n            Transform::from_xyz(1.5, 0.0, 0.0),\n        )]\n    )],\n));\n\nfn mover(mut query: Query<&mut Transform, With<Movable>>, time: Res<Time>) {\n    for mut transform in &mut query {\n        transform.translation.y = -cos(8.0 * time.elapsed_secs());\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\n- Expected result: the child and grand-child are supposed to move up and down.\n- Actual result: only the child moves. The grand-child doesn't.\n\nIt seems transform propagation is broken when hierarchy is deeper than 1.\n\n## Additional information\n\n- The issue doesn't happen with Bevy `0.15`.\n- I tried with the old `.with_children(|parent| {})` API, same issue.\n- I tried with a grand-grand-child, it doesn't move as well.\n- I tried logging global transforms, grand-child really doesn't move (it isn't a rendering issue).\n\n### Screenshot\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceb7b30d-4381-4c8f-897a-b49d2f5a0b41\n\n### Logs\n\n```text\n2025-03-14T18:04:22.982318Z  INFO
