Objective\r\nFixes #16192 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nI renamed the Pointer<Down/Up> to <Pressed/Released> and then I resolved all the errors. \r\nRenamed variables like \"is_down\" to \"is_pressed\" to maintain consistency.\r\nModified the docs in places where 'down/up' were used to maintain consistency.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI haven't tested this in any way beside the checks from rust analyzer and the examples in the examples/ directory.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n### `bevy_picking/src/pointer.rs`:\r\n#### `enum PressDirection`:\r\n\r\n- `PressDirection::Down` changes to `PressDirection::Pressed`.\r\n- `PressDirection::Up` changes to `PressDirection::Released`.\r\n\r\n\tThese changes are also relevant when working with `enum PointerAction`\r\n\r\n### `bevy_picking/src/events.rs`:\r\nClicking and pressing Events in events.rs categories change from [Down], [Up], [Click] to [Pressed], [Released], [Click].\r\n\r\n- \t`struct Down` changes to `struct Pressed` - fires when a pointer button is pressed over the 'target' entity.\r\n- \t`struct Up` changes to `struct Released` - fires when a pointer button is released over the 'target' entity.\r\n- \t`struct Click` now fires when a pointer sends a Pressed event followed by a Released event on the same 'target'.\r\n- \t`struct DragStart` now fires when the 'target' entity receives a pointer Pressed event followed by a pointer Move event.\r\n- \t`struct DragEnd` now fires when the 'target' entity is being dragged and receives a pointer Released event.\r\n- \t`PickingEventWriters<'w>::down_events: EventWriter<'w, Pointer<Down>>` changes to `PickingEventWriters<'w>::pressed_events: EventWriter<'w, Pointer<Pressed>>`.\r\n- \t`PickingEventWriters<'w>::up_events changes to
