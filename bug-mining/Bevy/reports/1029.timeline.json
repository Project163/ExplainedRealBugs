Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #21329 - The naming of the `clear_children` function could be misunderstood, so we suggest to rename it.\r\n\r\nThe current `clear_children` function could be understood to despawn the children, which it does not do. To emphasize the difference between `clear` and `despawn`, we can rename `clear` to `detach`. So we arrive at the final naming of `despawn` and `detach`.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nTo improve this, we could rename `clear_children` to `detach_children` and all other `clear`/`remove` functions too. I also suggest to rename all `remove_child*` functions for the same reason.\r\n\r\nThis renaming resulted in a confict because two methods now had the same name: \r\n- `detach_children(self)`, previously `clear_children`\r\n- `detach_children(self, children: &[Entity])`, previously `remove_children`\r\n\r\nTo solve this, I propose we rename the former to `detach_all_children`. This was chosen because it has the least impact, considering that all methods do take a slice of children, except this one.\r\n\r\nChanging the `insert_*` and `add_*` functions should be discussed. I think there is less potential for confusion, because they require you to pass an existing entity. Therefore it should be clear that this does not spawn anything.\r\n\r\nNote: The function `ui_surface.try_remove_children` has not been renamed.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nCurrently running the tests, but there are unrelated compile errors in wgpu-hal blocking me (I am on windows).\r\nFor this reason, this is a draft pull request. Feel free to provide feedback already, while I am trying to make the tests run.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nAs proposed in this PR, this would be a breaking change and will likely affect a large number of downstream projects directly. If you think this should be handled differently, via a `#[deprecated]` flag, I can rework the code to do that. \r\n\r\nIs there no documentation to update? The repo yielded no more search results than this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21470/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21470/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-13T16:33:09Z","updated_at":"2025-10-13T16:33:09Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21527","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21527/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21527/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21527/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21527","id":3510701800,"node_id":"I_kwDODf6-U87RQQ7o","number":21527,"title":"Rename clear_related methods to detach_related","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619327,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/D-Trivial","name":"D-Trivial","color":"008672","default":false,"description":"Nice and easy!
