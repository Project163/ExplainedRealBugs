in 0.15 the required components changes broke the previous implicit UI render ordering and to fix it some constants were added last moment:\n\n```\npub mod stack_z_offsets {\n    pub const BOX_SHADOW: f32 = -0.1;\n    pub const BACKGROUND_COLOR: f32 = 0.0;\n    pub const BORDER: f32 = 0.01;\n    pub const GRADIENT: f32 = 0.02;\n    pub const BORDER_GRADIENT: f32 = 0.03;\n    pub const IMAGE: f32 = 0.04;\n    pub const MATERIAL: f32 = 0.05;\n    pub const TEXT: f32 = 0.06;\n}\n```\n\nSo then to decide the rendering order, the u32 `stack_index` from the `ComputedNode` is converted into an `f32` and added to the appropriate constant from `stack_z_offset`. The offset constants need to be in the range -0.5..0.5 so they don't offset the z-index into the next stack index. \n\nBut some of the UI rendering functions weren't using the new constants and still expected the implicit ordering to work, which resulted in some UI elements like texture sliced nodes to be drawn behind the node's background color, #19691 fixed this.\n\n`uinode.stack_index()` is just an accessor function that returns the value of the `uinode.stack_index` field. The fields of `ComputedNode` used to be private, and the only way to access them was using the accessor methods. But in another recentish change they were made `pub`. Maybe the accessor functions should be removed, I'm not sure.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3293927099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ickshonpe","id":27962798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTYyNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27962798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe","html_url":"https://github.com/ickshonpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3294109065","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21059#issuecomment-3294109065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21059","id":3294109065,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U87EWB2J","user":{"login":"janhohenheim","id":9047632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDc2MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9047632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim","html_url":"https://github.com/janhohenheim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-15T21:59:59Z","updated_at":"2025-09-15T21:59:59Z","body":"The

internal ids so that users don't have to pick a random offset into `u32` to avoid colliding with other `ManualTextureView`s (I'm not sure if there ever are multiple systems/libraries using this functionality in the same world, but it's not forbidden).\r\nA quick search through github shows most people just start at 0.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping these docs might make it into 0.17 though, so unless
