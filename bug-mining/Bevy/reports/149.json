I then use `touch = touches.get_pressed(id)`, and then `touch.delta()` to figure out how much the finger has moved since the last frame.\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\nI was expecting smooth scrolling behaviour, but the actual movement was jittery and lagging behind the finger.\r\n\r\n## Cause of bug\r\n\r\nAfter investigating, this is caused by the implementation of [`touch_screen_input_system`](https://docs.rs/bevy_input/latest/bevy_input/touch/fn.touch_screen_input_system.html#), which treats each `TouchInput` event separately, and thus discards the previous position with each event instead of per frame. The `delta` position is wrong at the end of the frame if several `TouchInput` events arrived.\r\n\r\nThe system that updates the `Touches` resource should update the previous position once, at the start, and not with every event.\r\n\r\n## Workaround used\r\n\r\nI stored the previous position in another resource, but only for my \"captured\" touch id. For someone tracking the movement of several touches, it would need to be a HashMap of positions keyed by touch id.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12442/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12442/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
