some digging. Blender's default light is 1000 watts, their exporter exports this as 54,351 candelas (682,994 lumens). Blender's only exposure that I'm aware of / could find is the Color Management exposure value, which is calculated using `input_color * 2^exposure`. Note that this is the same formula Bevy uses for its Color Grading exposure. Both Blender and Bevy default these exposure values to 0.0.\r\n\r\nThis also means that #11347 added a _second_ exposure applied before the Color Grading exposure. This was not mentioned explicitly in that PR from what I've seen, and it does feel a bit strange to have two in two separate places. We should discuss / defend the existence of two exposure properties that exist in two different components that are functionally _very_ similar in terms of what they do to output colors.\r\n\r\nI exported a scene from Blender to GLTF and tried to align everything I could:\r\n* Blender defaults to Agx tonemapping, so I switched to that in Bevy\r\n* Blender defaults to 0.0 exposure, so I set ColorGrading::exposure to 0.0 (this is our default as well)\r\n* Blender, to my knowledge, has no other exposure settings. Therefore I hard coded `ExposureSettings::exposure()` to return 1.0, which makes it have no effect\r\n* I removed ambient lighting on both sides (no light == pure black)\r\n* Gamma is also 1.0 on both sides\r\n\r\nBlender is on the left, Bevy is on the right:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/2694663/234c284f-d237-40cf-b09a-48a9f514382b)\r\n\r\nBevy is significantly brighter / fully washed out. Something isn't being accounted for. Some ideas:\r\n\r\n1. Maybe Blender actually has an additional hidden \"camera exposure\" that is darkening things (similar to our hard coded exposure prior to #11347). We would then just need to calibrate accordingly (aka we do need a second exposure as introduced in #11347). This _does_ make sense conceptually / is consistent with Filament _and_ our previous hard-coded exposure.\r\n2. It is possible that the watts to candelas conversion done by blender is wrong (or their units are wrong somewhere else). Note that they _used to_ write watts directly to the gltf without conversion and then they corrected for that here: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-IO/issues/564. ~~But I've seen a lot of conflicting conversations about converting Blender's watts to lumens (ex: [multiply by 683](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/45209/what-kind-of-units-does-the-cycles-emission-strength-use)~~ (Edit: the previous link actually makes sense after converting from candelas to lumens / they line up well)\r\n3. Maybe our lighting calculations are just very out of sync / don't agree on how a light of a particular power behaves.\r\n\r\nSomething that does feel a bit strange: if I _do_ write the watts value directly to the Bevy point light (1000 as the \"intensity in lumens\") with no other changes to the settings above, things line up pretty nicely:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/2694663/2a4a98d6-c4d2-4713-aa7e-466916d20bb5)\r\n\r\n(blender left, bevy right)\r\n\r\nLines up quite well in terms of brightness!\r\n\r\nLikewise if I hard code Bevy's `ColorGrading::exposure` to `(-7.0f32).exp2() and set Blender's exposure to -7 (note the minus), we get this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/2694663/0f52b3d4-56f3-4371-8565-49d6169d6bfe)\r\n\r\nThey line up pretty much exactly! Maybe just coincidence. But it is interesting. If we plug our ears and pretend Watts == Lumens and that we don't need ev100 exposure settings, then we are roughly in sync with blender _and_ we get lumen values that _line up with expectations from the real world_ (~1000 lumens for an indoor lamp). Weird.\r\n\r\nAnother comparison: if we take the first case (using the exported Watts->candelas->lumens), but also set our new `ExposureSettings::ev100` to 10.0 (more than the new default of 7.0, less than the old hard-coded default of ~12), we get this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/2694663/87aa04b6-d977-4cfc-8c0b-d76ab7020492)\r\n\r\nEssentially identical!\r\n\r\nAnd here is the current default ev100 (7.0):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/2694663/78dade36-05eb-4fcd-8afe-47e942d339e3)\r\n\r\nNote that Bevy's lighting is oversaturated relative to Blender's.\r\n\r\nMy current bet is:\r\n\r\n1. The Blender GLTF exporter is probably correct about its watts -> candelas conversion\r\n2. Eevee _does_ have some sort of internal exposure setting that is close to `ev100` 10.0 (which _is_ a very reasonable number)\r\n3. For some reason inherent to the approach both we (and blender) are using, we need exorbitantly high / non-real-world lumens (on the order of hundreds of thousands) to emulate an indoor lamp (which should be closer to 1,000)\r\n\r\nIn that case, we should just calibrate our default `ev100` to 10.0, accept the crazy numbers required, and call it a day. It would be reassuring if we could reproduce these results in at least one other engine (blender, unity, unreal, etc) with aligned settings.\r\n\r\nMy \"long shot\" conspiracy theory bet (based on the weird agreement in the second test above) is that Eevee and Bevy are using roughly the same algorithms internally, they agree on lumens as units (and blender is just wrong about it being watts), blender doesn't have a hidden exposure roughly 10.0 ev100 (and therefore we should remove ours / default it to something that produces 1.0 as the factor), and we can therefore use \"real world\" lumen values.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1940445403/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1940741401","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11577#issuecomment-1940741401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11577","id":1940741401,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U85zrV0Z","user":{"login":"GitGhillie","id":23659539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjU5NTM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23659539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitGhillie","html_url":"https://github.com/GitGhillie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitGhillie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitGhillie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitGhillie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitGhillie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitGhillie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitGhillie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitGhillie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitGhillie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GitGhillie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-13T08:32:23Z","updated_at":"2024-02-13T08:32:23Z","body":"> This also means that https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11347 added a second exposure applied before the Color Grading exposure.
