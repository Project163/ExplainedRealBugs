The `TextColor` of the parent (with `Text`) is correct. But each `TextSpan` child uses the previous `TextColor` component instead of its own, i.e. the first child uses the `TextColor` of the parent, the second child that of the first and so on.\n\nHere's a minimal example if you want to reproduce the issue.\n\n```rust\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut app = App::new();\n    app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_systems(Startup, spawn_text)\n        .run();\n}\n\nfn spawn_text(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn(Camera2d);\n\n    commands.spawn((\n        Text::new(\"B\"),\n        TextColor(Srgba::WHITE.into()),\n        children![\n            (TextSpan::new(\"e\"), TextColor(Srgba::RED.into())),\n            (TextSpan::new(\"v\"), TextColor(Srgba::GREEN.into())),\n            (TextSpan::new(\"y\"), TextColor(Srgba::BLUE.into()))\n        ],\n    ));\n}\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20834/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
