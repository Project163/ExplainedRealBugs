also wonder how this works with adding multiple additive animations. (That is an intended use-case right?)\r\nIn the case of translations, this operation is associative, in the current quaternion case it is not. (but would be in the suggested one).\r\n\r\nTo me it looks like we're trying to exponentiate group elements here.\r\n\r\nWe have some group G (of translations, rotations, etc...) we are animating and we have a sample `s`.\r\nWe then have another element `a` which we want to additively blend, that is, compose it: `s <- a * s`\r\n(question: is the composition supposed to be a left or right composition? it doesn't matter for translations as they commute, but it does matter for rotations)\r\n\r\nWe then want to introduce a real-number weight parameter `w` such that `w = 0` does nothing (`s <- s`) and `w = 1` does the full effect of `a` (`s <- a * s`), intuitively I'd think that `w = 2` should do the effect twice `s <- a * a * s` and `w = 0.5` should do it \"half\" in the sense that it would have to be applied twice to obtain the effect of `w = 1`.\r\n\r\nThis points me to the idea that we're looking for an operation of group exponentiation `a^w` that follows the standard expected behaviour:\r\n```\r\na^0 = identity\r\na^1 = a\r\na^(x+y) = a^x * a^y\r\nnotably:\r\na^2 = a * a\r\nand\r\na = a^0.5 * a^0.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, the sound way to mathematically define this is to:\r\nA) map the group element into its lie algebra (which is a vector space)\r\nB) scale the vector\r\nC) map back to a group element\r\n`a^w := exp(w * ln(a))`\r\n\r\nIn the case of translations, the group of vectors is already the lie algebra, hence no visible mapping happens and we just do the vector scaling.\r\nIn the case of rotations, unless I'm mistaken, this procedure yields\r\n```Quat::slerp(Quat::IDENTITY, a, w)```\r\n\r\nTL;DR: From a math standpoint I believe that the code is wrong and the new proposal is sound.\r\nI don't know if there's an animation reason to do it mathematically unsoundly like this (why is this behaviour desired?)\r\nAlso I wonder if we should left-compose or right-compose the additive

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #13832\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdditively blend quaternions like this:\r\n```rust\r\nrotation = Quat::slerp(Quat::IDENTITY, incoming_rotation, weight) * rotation;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nRan `animation_masks`, which behaves the same as before. (In the context of an animation being blended only onto the base pose, there is no difference.)\r\n\r\nWe should create some examples that actually exercise more of the capabilities of the `AnimationGraph` so that issues like this can become more visible in general. (On the other hand, I'm quite certain this was wrong before.)\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the implementation of `Quat: Animatable`, which was not used internally by Bevy prior to this release version. If you relied on the old behavior of additive quaternion blending in manual applications, that code will have to be updated, as the old behavior was incorrect.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15662/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14528850308,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86MLKVDzwAAAANh_KmE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14528850308","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"42e0771633eeb9e8c1eb62d7e0671dd03f2da66d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/42e0771633eeb9e8c1eb62d7e0671dd03f2da66d","created_at":"2024-10-05T20:19:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14528850333,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86MLKVDzwAAAANh_Kmd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14528850333","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-05T20:19:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
