The `#[states(scoped_entities)]` does nothing in the default case.\n\nHowever, for a long time, the only way to enable state scoping was using `enable_state_scoped_entities`, so I expect many people to still have that in their code. In fact, I had that in my code while migrating to 0.17.0-dev.\nBut this will actually \"enable\" the state scope again, causing Bevy to try to despawn entities marked `DespawnOnExitState` twice, resulting in a very unhelpful warning.\n\nMinimal repro:\n\n```rust\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .init_state::<AppState>()\n        // Evil!\n        .enable_state_scoped_entities::<AppState>()\n        .add_systems(Startup, spawn)\n        .add_systems(Update, change_state)\n        .run();\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Default, Eq, PartialEq, Hash, States)]\n#[states(scoped_entities)]\nenum AppState {\n    #[default]\n    A,\n    B,\n}\n\nfn spawn(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn(DespawnOnExitState(AppState::A));\n}\n\nfn change_state(mut next_state: ResMut<NextState<AppState>>) {\n    next_state.set(AppState::B);\n}\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\nI get this warning:\n\n> 2025-09-04T14:04:44.976611Z  WARN bevy_ecs::err::handler: Encountered an error in command `<bevy_ecs::system::commands::entity_command::despawn::{{closure}} as bevy_ecs::error::command_handling::CommandWithEntity<core::result::Result<(), bevy_ecs::world::error::EntityMutableFetchError>>>::with_entity::{{closure}}`: The entity with ID 22v1 was despawned by src/demo/brain_atlas.rs:43:14\n> \n>     If you were attempting to apply a command to this entity,\n>     and want to handle this error gracefully, consider using `EntityCommands::queue_handled` or `queue_silenced`.\n\nWhich \n- Doesn't use `NameOrEntity`, so good luck finding out which entity this is talking about and\n- tells you to use `queue_handled` or `queue_silenced` even though you as the user aren't actually calling any commands!\n\nSo this threw me for a loop, haha\n\n\n## Additional information\n\nNote that `#[states(scoped_entities)]` does not cause duplicate enablings\n\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20866/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
