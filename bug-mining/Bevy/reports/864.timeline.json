about this in the #ecs-dev discord channel out of curiosity: it sounds like it's possible for users to introduce multiple observers that could feasibly cause cycles (observer system 'A' sends an event that triggers observer system 'B'...and wraps back to 'A' again). It sounds like the current behavior is that bevy will loop in this case (I'm not suggesting any changes to that).

triggered).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14598/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14716080062,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86OAj2tzwAAAANtJY--","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14716080062","actor":{"login":"VitalyAnkh","id":24508452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTA4NDUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24508452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalyAnkh","html_url":"https://github.com/VitalyAnkh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalyAnkh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalyAnkh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalyAnkh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalyAnkh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalyAnkh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalyAnkh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalyAnkh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalyAnkh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VitalyAnkh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-18T09:28:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15877310340,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86OAj2tzwAAAAOyXIeE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15877310340","actor":{"login":"lomirus","id":21173956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTczOTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21173956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomirus","html_url":"https://github.com/lomirus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomirus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomirus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomirus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomirus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomirus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomirus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomirus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomirus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lomirus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-10T06:28:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17425583362,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86OAj2tzwAAAAQOpU0C","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17425583362","actor":{"login":"qoh","id":1732901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzI5MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1732901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qoh","html_url":"https://github.com/qoh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qoh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qoh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qoh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qoh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qoh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qoh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qoh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qoh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qoh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-28T00:55:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18100169180,"node_id":"ATPVTE_lADODf6-U86OAj2tzwAAAAQ22qnc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18100169180","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/user

Objective\r\n\r\nThe documentation for observers is not very good. This poses a problem to users, but *also* causes serious problems for engine devs, as they attempt to improve assorted issues surrounding observers.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n\r\n- Fixes #14084.\r\n- Fixes #14726.\r\n- Fixes #16538.\r\n- Closes #18914, by attempting to solve the same issue.\r\n\r\nTo keep this PR at all reviewable, I've opted to simply note the various limitations (some may call them bugs!) in place, rather than attempting to fix them. There is a huge amount of cleanup work to be done here: see https://github.com/orgs/bevyengine/projects/17.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Write good module docs for observers, offering bread crumbs to the most common methods and techniques and comparing-and-contrasting as needed.\r\n- Fix any actively misleading documentation.\r\n- Try to explain how the various bits of the (public?!) internals are related.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19590/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19590/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18102714076,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86OAj2tzwAAAAQ3AX7c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18102714076","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"12f8f9c07c9e0ce81aba72b18d9450645d51ade9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/12f8f9c07c9e0ce81aba72b18d9450645d51ade9","created_at":"2025-06-11T22:23:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18102714205,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86OAj2tzwAAAAQ3AX9d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18102714205","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-11T22:23:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18159250145,"node_id":"PVTISC_lADODf6-U86OAj2tzwAAAAQ6YCrh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18159250145","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"project_v2_item_status_changed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-15T20:55:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
