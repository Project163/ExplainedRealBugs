The obvious solution is to simply make each type of component hook its own method.\r\n\r\nAs @james-o-brien [points out](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1329275973501190216/1329632664616960091), the most naive solution won't work, because we want to cache whether or not each component has each kind of hook (stored in the flags on archetypes). As far as we know, there's no way to statically check if the function provided is actually a no-op.\r\n\r\nThis came up in the context of relationships.\r\n\r\n> This feels like a weird place for this method. I'd kinda prefer making `on_insert` etc methods for `Component` (and removing the awkward `register_component_hooks` API), and then generating those methods in the `Component` trait with the `Relationship` derive macro.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @alice-i-cecile in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17398#discussion_r1919445892_\r\n            ","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
