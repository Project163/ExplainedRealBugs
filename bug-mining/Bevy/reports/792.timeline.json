If you can, consider providing a code snippet or link.\n\nIn my game I needed to have my materials update based on some state.\nI have many entities in my game (100) which had this component and I noticed my fps absolutely suffering.\nAfter some profiling (renderdoc, nsight) I found out that it's most likely a VRAM leak (or something similar since the capture size gets ridiculously big) and the color changing isn't actually what's causing this problem, it's just calling the following method on many components:\n`material.get_mut(handle)`\nI also compiled with release as my target\n\n## Additional information\n\nFirst your fps will be fine but then drop rapidly, more noticeable on a high refresh rate monitor.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0274ebc-c54c-4f20-b0fc-c0b7a358a8de)\n\n## How to reproduce\n\nGet the newest bevy-rc (0.16-rc5) and add bevy_dev_tools to have the fps counter\nTake the animated mat example and increase the entity spawn count to something like 20 * 20\nYou can even delete the mutating code, it's just the call to `get_mut(id)`\n\n ```rust\n//!
