Bevy version\n\n0.15.0\n\n## Relevant system information\n\n```ignore\nAdapterInfo { name: \"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060\", vendor: 4318, device: 7944, device_type: DiscreteGpu, driver: \"NVIDIA\", driver_info: \"566.14\", backend: Vulkan }\n```\n\n## What you did\n\nUpgraded to Bevy 0.15. The code is available here: https://github.com/Asempere123123/space_game. The version for Bevy 0.14 is on the main branch, while the updated code for 0.15 is on the migration branch.\n\n## What went wrong\n\nThere appears to be a memory leak causing Bevy to over-allocate. Running the game with Bevy 0.14 results in memory usage around 400 MB to 1 GB. However, with Bevy 0.15, memory usage continually increases until it consumes all available RAM, causing the program to crash.\n\n## Additional information\n\nI think the bug might be mesh-related. I have a procedural mesh generator that creates the mesh of a planet procedurally (making it more precise the closer you are). If you get close to the planet (really close, on the surface), the bug starts to occur. I don't think it's my mesher's fault, since the same code works well in 0.14.\n\n### 0.14 (Expected):\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e61b5402-4936-4c5c-b64c-62559fcee689)\n\n### 0.15:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5daaa85d-a9c4-44ac-9211-8a0eaddd61c1)\n(Memory usage keeps increasing until the program crashes.)\n\n### Code Changes:\nHere are the code changes: https://github.com/Asempere123123/space_game/compare/migration?expand=1\n\n### Controls (for testing localy)\nIf anybody wants to try the game to test it, the controls are currently a bit weird:\nAt startup, there is an orbiting camera. You can orbit by right-clicking and zoom by scrolling.\n\nPressing 'T' switches to a free camera. However, the math is currently incorrect, so it only works near the equator.\nI recommend zooming in orbit mode at startup and then switching to the free camera. This way, you end up close to the cube shown in the screenshots.\n\nSince the planets are large, in free mode:\n* Pressing 'O' doubles the movement speed.\n* Pressing 'P' halves the movement speed.\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16586/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
