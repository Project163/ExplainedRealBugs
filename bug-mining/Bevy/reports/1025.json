These situations are very case-by-case migrations.\n\nBut that does not work for users doing the opposite: creating a `Handle` from a `Uuid`. For example when loading assets dynamically from a server with per-resource uuid. There is no elegant solution to create the `Handle::Uuid` variant:\n\n```rust\nlet handle = Handle::Uuid(uuid, PhantomData);\n```\n\n```rust\nlet handle = Handle::Uuid(uuid, Default::default());\n```\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\n```\nlet handle = Handle::from_uuid(uuid);\n```\n\nand/or\n\n```rust\nimpl From<Uuid> for Handle {\n  fn from(uuid: Uuid) -> Self {\n    Handle::Uuid(uuid, PhantomData)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nThe `uuid_handle!()` but it works only for static const &str (str literals).\n\n## Additional context\n\nNone.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21349/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
