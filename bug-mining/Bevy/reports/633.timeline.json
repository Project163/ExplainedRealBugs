This is especially common if you batch several items. In one compute pass you bind it as a whole and work on the entire array. But in other passes you bind just one element, or a chunk (= view = sub-array) of it. In Hanabi this is \"work on all particles\" vs. \"work on a single group\" (which is stored alongside all the other groups for the effect, inside the same buffer). Why is that helpful compared to binding the whole buffer? Because your compute pass doesn't need to know how to address the chunk; it's implicit by the binding, so saves on extra data to pass. Now, I believe the key aspect here is not about the usage of dynamic offsets, but the fact that if you want to bind a sub-array, then the first element of that sub-array needs to be aligned according to [`min_storage_buffer_offset_alignment`](https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/struct.Limits.html#structfield.min_storage_buffer_offset_alignment) (independently of whether the offset in the storage buffer was specified at layout time or dynamically at bind time), which can be up to 256 bytes on some platforms (macOS silicon in particular). And that means *all* elements of the array need to be aligned like this, unless you know exactly where the chunks you bind are in advance. And aligning all array elements to _e.g._ 256 bytes takes a lot more wasted padding than only aligning the start of the array. But sometimes it's still worth it (better have 30 elements and waste 500 bytes, but run only one compute pass, than having to handle 30 separate tiny buffers and dispatch 30 separate compute passes to avoid the padding).\r\n\r\nIs `DynamicStorageBuffer` for this usage? That's what I'm trying to confirm.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2336766500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"djeedai","id":6532395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MzIzOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6532395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djeedai","html_url":"https://github.com/djeedai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djeedai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djeedai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djeedai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djeedai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djeedai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djeedai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djeedai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djeedai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djeedai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2336767193","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15052#issuecomment-2336767193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15052","id":2336767193,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86LSDzZ","user":{"login":"JMS55","id":47158642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTU4NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47158642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55","html_url":"https://github.com/JMS55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-08T17:44:10Z","updated_at":"2024-09-08T17:44:10Z","body":"Sounds
