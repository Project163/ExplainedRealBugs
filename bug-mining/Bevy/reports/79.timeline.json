Objective\r\n\r\n- As part of the migration process we need to a) see the end effect of the migration on user ergonomics b) check for serious perf regressions c) actually migrate the code\r\n- To accomplish this, I'm going to attempt to migrate all of the remaining user-facing usages of `LegacyColor` in one PR, being careful to keep a clean commit history.\r\n- Fixes #12056.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nI've chosen to use the polymorphic `Color` type as our standard user-facing API.\r\n\r\n- [x] Migrate `bevy_gizmos`.\r\n- [x] Take `impl Into<Color>` in all `bevy_gizmos` APIs\r\n- [x] Migrate sprites\r\n- [x] Migrate UI\r\n- [x] Migrate `ColorMaterial`\r\n- [x] Migrate `MaterialMesh2D`\r\n- [x] Migrate fog\r\n- [x] Migrate lights\r\n- [x] Migrate StandardMaterial\r\n- [x] Migrate wireframes\r\n- [x] Migrate clear color\r\n- [x] Migrate text\r\n- [x] Migrate gltf loader\r\n- [x] Register color types for reflection\r\n- [x] Remove `LegacyColor`\r\n- [x] Make sure CI passes\r\n\r\nIncidental improvements to ease migration:\r\n\r\n- added `Color::srgba_u8`, `Color::srgba_from_array` and friends\r\n- added `set_alpha`, `is_fully_transparent` and `is_fully_opaque` to the `Alpha` trait\r\n- add and immediately deprecate (lol) `Color::rgb` and friends in favor of more explicit and consistent `Color::srgb`\r\n- standardized on white and black for most example text colors\r\n- added vector field traits to `LinearRgba`: ~~`Add`, `Sub`, `AddAssign`, `SubAssign`,~~ `Mul<f32>` and `Div<f32>`. Multiplications and divisions do not scale alpha. `Add` and `Sub` have been cut from this PR.\r\n- added `LinearRgba` and `Srgba` `RED/GREEN/BLUE`\r\n- added `LinearRgba_to_f32_array` and `LinearRgba::to_u32`\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nBevy's color types have changed! Wherever you used a `bevy::render::Color`, a `bevy::color::Color` is used instead.\r\n\r\nThese are quite similar! Both are enums storing a color in a specific color space (or to be more precise, using a specific color model). However, each of the different color models now has its own type.\r\n\r\nTODO...\r\n\r\n- `Color::rgba`, `Color::rgb`, `Color::rbga_u8`, `Color::rgb_u8`, `Color::rgb_from_array` are now `Color::srgba`, `Color::srgb`, `Color::srgba_u8`, `Color::srgb_u8` and `Color::srgb_from_array`.\r\n- `Color::set_a` and `Color::a` is now `Color::set_alpha` and `Color::alpha`. These are part of the `Alpha` trait in `bevy_color`.\r\n- `Color::is_fully_transparent` is now part of the `Alpha` trait in `bevy_color`\r\n- `Color::r`, `Color::set_r`, `Color::with_r` and the equivalents for `g`, `b` `h`, `s` and `l` have been removed due to causing silent relatively expensive conversions. Convert your `Color` into the desired color space, perform your operations there, and then convert it back into a polymorphic `Color` enum.\r\n- `Color::hex` is now `Srgba::hex`. Call `.into` or construct a `Color::Srgba` variant manually to convert it. \r\n- `WireframeMaterial`, `ExtractedUiNode`, `ExtractedDirectionalLight`, `ExtractedPointLight`, `ExtractedSpotLight`  and `ExtractedSprite` now store a `LinearRgba`, rather than a polymorphic `Color`\r\n- `Color::rgb_linear` and `Color::rgba_linear` are now `Color::linear_rgb` and `Color::linear_rgba`\r\n- The various CSS color constants are no longer stored directly on `Color`. Instead, they're defined in the `Srgba` color space, and accessed via `bevy::color::palettes::css`. Call `.into()` on them to convert them into a `Color` for quick debugging use, and consider using the much prettier `tailwind` palette for prototyping.\r\n- The `LIME_GREEN` color has been renamed to `LIMEGREEN` to comply with the standard naming.\r\n- Vector field arithmetic operations on `Color` (add, subtract, multiply and divide by a f32) have been removed. Instead, convert your colors into `LinearRgba` space, and perform your operations explicitly there. This is particularly relevant when working with emissive or HDR colors, whose color channel values are routinely outside of the ordinary 0 to 1 range.\r\n- `Color::as_linear_rgba_f32` has been removed. Call `LinearRgba::to_f32_array` instead, converting if needed.\r\n- `Color::as_linear_rgba_u32` has been removed. Call `LinearRgba::to_u32` instead, converting if needed.\r\n- Several other color conversion methods to transform LCH or HSL colors into float arrays or `Vec` types have been removed. Please reimplement these externally or open a PR to re-add them if you found them particularly useful.\r\n- Various methods on `Color` such as `rgb` or `hsl` to convert the color into a specific color space have been removed. Convert into `LinearRgba`, then to the color space of your choice.\r\n- Various implicitly-converting color value methods on `Color` such as `r`, `g`, `b` or `h` have been removed. Please convert it into the color space of your choice, then check these properties.\r\n- `Color` no longer implements `AsBindGroup`. Store a `LinearRgba` internally instead to avoid conversion costs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12163/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-28T00:47:57Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T00:47:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12173","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12173/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12173/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12173/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12173","id":2157866280,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U85oHSd3","number":12173,"title":"`bevy_color`: Add `sequence_dispersed` to `Hsla`, `Lcha`, `Oklcha`","user":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Feature","name":"C-Feature","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A new feature, making something new possible"},{"id":2045383863,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQ1MzgzODYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-Rendering","name":"A-Rendering","color":"C6A751","default":false,"description":"Drawing game state to the screen"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.
