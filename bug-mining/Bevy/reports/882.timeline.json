This ties in with [@pcwalton](https://github.com/pcwalton)'s plans to offer MaterialX support right? Can you explain how those fit together?\n\nYup! Basically, for any kind of dynamic UI, we need the ability to change the layout of the material at runtime. This means treating materials more like dynamic runtime values than Rust types (although we likely still want to support the ergonomics of code first API allowing you to \"just\" define a struct).\n\nThe easy example here would be that you drag a texture node into your material, now we need to add a field for a texture and sampler to the underlying shader, which requires rebuilding the pipeline for that shader.\n\nImplementing MaterialX will require further work, e.g. doing some kind of code generation to create the actual shaders themselves, but this is also useful for other DX use cases like live coding as seen in the example video above.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2689219632/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tychedelia","id":10366310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY2MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10366310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia","html_url":"https://github.com/tychedelia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16504896828,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86r_v_zzwAAAAPXxL08","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16504896828","actor":{"login":"ChristopherBiscardi","id":551247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTI0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/551247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi","html_url":"https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-28T00:19:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16536298712,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86r_v_zzwAAAAPZo-TY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16536298712","actor":{"login":"eckz","id":567737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzczNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/567737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eckz","html_url":"https://github.com/eckz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eckz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eckz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eckz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eckz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eckz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eckz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eckz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eckz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eckz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-03T15:24:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"tychedelia","id":10366310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY2MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10366310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia","html_url":"https://github.com/tychedelia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-06T17:49:39Z","updated_at":"2025-04-06T17:49:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18734","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyeng

`RenderMaterialInstances` and `RenderMeshMaterialIds` are very similar render-world resources: the former maps main world meshes to typed material asset IDs, and the latter maps main world meshes to untyped material asset IDs. This is needlessly-complex and wasteful, so this patch unifies the two in favor of a single untyped `RenderMaterialInstances` resource.\r\n\r\nThis patch also fixes a subtle issue that could cause mesh materials to be incorrect if a `MeshMaterial3d<A>` was removed and replaced with a `MeshMaterial3d<B>` material in the same frame. The problematic pattern looks like:\r\n\r\n1. `extract_mesh_materials<B>` runs and, seeing the `Changed<MeshMaterial3d<B>>` condition, adds an entry mapping the mesh to the new material to the untyped `RenderMeshMaterialIds`.\r\n\r\n2. `extract_mesh_materials<A>` runs and, seeing that the entity is present in `RemovedComponents<MeshMaterial3d<A>>`, removes the entry from `RenderMeshMaterialIds`.\r\n\r\n3. The material slot is now empty, and the mesh will show up as whatever material happens to be in slot 0 in the material data slab.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the issue by splitting out `extract_mesh_materials` into *three* phases: *extraction*, *early sweeping*, and *late sweeping*, which run in that order:\r\n\r\n1. The *extraction* system, which runs for each material, updates `RenderMaterialInstances` records whenever `MeshMaterial3d` components change, and updates a change tick so that the following system will know not to remove it.\r\n\r\n2. The *early sweeping* system, which runs for each material, processes entities present in `RemovedComponents<MeshMaterial3d>` and removes each such entity's record from `RenderMeshInstances` only if the extraction system didn't update it this frame. This system runs after *all* extraction systems have completed, fixing the race condition.\r\n\r\n3. The *late sweeping* system, which runs only once regardless of the number of materials in the scene, processes entities present in `RemovedComponents<ViewVisibility>` and, as in the early sweeping phase, removes each such entity's record from `RenderMeshInstances` only if the extraction system didn't update it this frame. At the end, the late sweeping system updates the change tick.\r\n\r\nBecause this pattern happens relatively frequently, I think this PR should land for 0.16.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18734/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17279461714,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86r_v_zzwAAAAQF76lS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17279461714","actor":{"login":"mocheer","id":16283662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjgzNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16283662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mocheer","html_url":"https://github.com/mocheer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mocheer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mocheer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mocheer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mocheer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mocheer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mocheer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mocheer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mocheer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mocheer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-16T01:29:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"tychedelia","id":10366310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY2MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10366310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia","html_url":"https://github.com/tychedelia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-07T18:15:36Z","updated_at":"2025-05-07T18:15:36Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19064","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19064/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19064/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19064/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19064","id":3038491885,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86U4BMf","number":19064,"title":"Fix

Objective\r\n\r\nCloses #18075\r\n\r\nIn order to enable a number of patterns for dynamic materials in the engine, it's necessary to decouple the renderer from the `Material` trait. \r\n\r\nThis opens the possibility for:\r\n- Materials that aren't coupled to `AsBindGroup`.\r\n- 2d using the underlying 3d bindless infrastructure.\r\n- Dynamic materials that can change their layout at runtime.\r\n- Materials that aren't even backed by a Rust struct at all.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIn short, remove all trait bounds from render world material systems and resources. This means moving a bunch of stuff onto `MaterialProperties` and engaging in some hacks to make specialization work. Rather than storing the bind group data in `MaterialBindGroupAllocator`, right now we're storing it in a closure on `MaterialProperties`. TBD if this has bad performance characteristics.\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks\r\n\r\n- `many_cubes`:\r\n`cargo run --example many_cubes --release --features=bevy/trace_tracy -- --vary-material-data-per-instance`:\r\n![Screenshot 2025-06-26 235426](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10a0ee29-9932-4f91-ab43-33518b117ac5)\r\n\r\n- @DGriffin91's Caldera\r\n`cargo run --release --features=bevy/trace_tracy -- --random-materials`\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef91ba6a-8e88-4922-a73f-acb0af5b0dbc)\r\n\r\n\r\n- @DGriffin91's Caldera with 20 unique material types (i.e. `MaterialPlugin<M>`) and random materials per mesh\r\n`cargo run --release --features=bevy/trace_tracy -- --random-materials`\r\n![Screenshot 2025-06-27 000425](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9561388b-881d-46cf-8c3d-b15b3e9aedc7)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n\r\n- We almost certainly lost some parallelization from removing the type params that could be gained back from smarter iteration.\r\n- Test all the things that could have broken.\r\n- ~Fix meshlets~\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\nSee [the example](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19667/files#diff-9d768cfe1c3aa81eff365d250d3cbe5a63e8df63e81dd85f64c3c3cd993f6d94) for a custom material implemented without the use of the `Material` trait and thus `AsBindGroup`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3fcca7c-e04e-4a4e-9d89-39d697a9e3b8)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19667/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18365741455,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86r_v_zzwAAAARGrvmP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18365741455","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e6ba9a6d181ad20320e4dadc26575b7f5a6c6f94","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/e6ba9a6d181ad20320e4dadc26575b7f5a6c6f94","created_at":"2025-06-27T23:17:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18365741557,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86r_v_zzwAAAARGrvn1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18365741557","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-27T23:17:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
