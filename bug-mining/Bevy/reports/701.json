Create an observer for `OnReplace` or `OnRemove` some component A\n2. Create another observer for `OnReplace` or `OnRemove` some component B\n3. Spawn an entity with some component A\n4. Remove the bundle `(A, B)` from that entity\n\n```rust\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_systems(Startup, spawn_stuff)\n        .add_observer(observe_remove_a)\n        .add_observer(observe_remove_b)\n        .run();\n}\n\nfn spawn_stuff(mut commands: Commands) {\n    let e = commands.spawn(A).id();\n    commands.entity(e).remove::<(A, B)>();\n}\n\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct A;\n\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct B;\n\nfn observe_remove_a(trigger: Trigger<OnRemove, A>) {\n    info!(\"Removed A\");\n}\n\nfn observe_remove_b(trigger: Trigger<OnRemove, B>) {\n    info!(\"Removed B\");\n}\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\nBoth observers are triggered, even though the entity has no component `B`.\n\nThis only happens if you are observing the same trigger for another component in the bundle that matches. So in the above example, removing `observe_remove_a` does not result in `observe_remove_b` triggering. Or changing `observe_remove_b` to be `OnReplace` also doesn't make `observe_remove_b` trigger.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17897/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
