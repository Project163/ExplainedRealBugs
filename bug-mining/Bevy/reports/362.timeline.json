Objective\r\n\r\nRewrite screenshotting to be able to accept any `RenderTarget`.\r\n\r\nCloses #12478 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nPreviously, screenshotting relied on setting a variety of state on the requested window. When extracted, the window's `swap_chain_texture_view` property would be swapped out with a texture_view created that frame for the screenshot pipeline to write back to the cpu.\r\n\r\nBesides being tightly coupled to window in a way that prevented screenshotting other render targets, this approach had the drawback of relying on the implicit state of `swap_chain_texture_view` being returned from a `NormalizedRenderTarget` when view targets were prepared. Because property is set every frame for windows, that wasn't a problem, but poses a problem for render target images. Namely, to do the equivalent trick, we'd have to replace the `GpuImage`'s texture view, and somehow restore it later.\r\n\r\nAs such, this PR creates a new `prepare_view_textures` system which runs before `prepare_view_targets` that allows a new `prepare_screenshots` system to be sandwiched between and overwrite the render targets texture view if a screenshot has been requested that frame for the given target.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, screenshotting itself has been changed to use a component + observer pattern. We now spawn a `Screenshot` component into the world, whose lifetime is tracked with a series of marker components. When the screenshot is read back to the CPU, we send the image over a channel back to the main world where an observer fires on the screenshot entity before being despawned the next frame. This allows the user to access resources in their save callback that might be useful (e.g. uploading the screenshot over the network, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48f19aed-d9e1-4058-bb17-82b37f992b7b)\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Web\r\n- [ ] Manual texture view\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\nrender to texture example:\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/612ac47b-8a24-4287-a745-3051837963b0\" width=200/>\r\n\r\nweb saving still works:\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2a15b17-1ff5-4006-ab2a-e5cc74888b9c\" width=200/>\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n`ScreenshotManager` has been removed. To take a screenshot, spawn a `Screenshot` entity with the specified render target and provide an observer targeting the `ScreenshotCaptured` event.

Objective\r\n\r\n- Makes `headless_renderer` example work instead of exiting without effect.\r\n- Guides users who actually just need [`Screenshot`](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.16.1/bevy/render/view/window/screenshot/struct.Screenshot.html) to use that instead.\r\n\r\nThis PR was inspired by my own efforts to do headless rendering, in which the complexity of the `headless_renderer` example was a distraction, and this comment from https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12478#issuecomment-2094925039 :\r\n\r\n> The example added in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/13006 would benefit from this change: be sure to clean it up when tackling this work :)\r\n\r\nThat “cleanup” was not done, and I thought to do it, but it seems to me that using `Screenshot` (in its current form) in the example would not be correct, because — if I understand correctly — the example is trying to, potentially, capture many *consecutive* frames, whereas `Screenshot` by itself gives no means to capture multiple frames without gaps or duplicates. But perhaps I am wrong (the code is complex and not clearly documented), or perhaps that feature isn’t worth preserving. In that case, let me know and I will revise this PR.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Added `exit_condition: bevy::window::ExitCondition::DontExit`\r\n- Added a link to `Screenshot` in the crate documentation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Ran the example and confirmed that it now writes an image file and then exits.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19598/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18122388668,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86CVE6NzwAAAAQ4LbS8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18122388668","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1dfe83bb8d27039fb4a0a4ff256d161f216f6276","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/1dfe83bb8d27039fb4a0a4ff256d161f216f6276","created_at":"2025-06-12T20:31:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
