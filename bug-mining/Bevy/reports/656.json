I have tested both on windows and macos. I found this issue will happen on windows.\n\nthis panic is caused by window resource has been recycle but bounce_system is still trying to get and then cause panic.\n```rust\n// Bounce sprites outside the window\nfn bounce_system(window: Single<&Window>, mut sprites: Query<(&Transform, &mut Velocity)>) {\n    let width = window.width();\n    let height = window.height();\n    let left = width / -2.0;\n    let right = width / 2.0;\n    let bottom = height / -2.0;\n    let top = height / 2.0;\n    // The default batch size can also be overridden.\n    // In this case a batch size of 32 is chosen to limit the overhead of\n    // ParallelIterator, since negating a vector is very inexpensive.\n    sprites\n        .par_iter_mut()\n        .batching_strategy(BatchingStrategy::fixed(32))\n        .for_each(|(transform, mut v)| {\n            if !(left < transform.translation.x\n                && transform.translation.x < right\n                && bottom < transform.translation.y\n                && transform.translation.y < top)\n            {\n                // For simplicity, just reverse the velocity; don't use realistic bounces\n                v.0 = -v.0;\n            }\n        });\n}\n```\n\nFixed in #17533 \n\nso I'm not sure this is a proper solution. but unregister all system first then recycle window maybe not easy on all platfoms\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17532/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
