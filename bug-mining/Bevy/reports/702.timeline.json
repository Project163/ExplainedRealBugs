Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #17945 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nCheck if the view being extracted has OIT enabled and incorporate the associated bit into the mesh pipeline key.\r\n\r\nI basically have no idea what's going on in the renderer, so let me know if I missed something, which is extraordinarily possible.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI modified the `order_independent_transparency` example to put everything on the default render layer and render a gizmo at the origin. Previously, this would cause the application to panic.

Objective\r\n\r\nThis PR enables `bevy_gizmos` to be used without `bevy_pbr`, for user who want to create their custom mesh rendering logic.\r\n\r\nIt can also be useful for user who just want to use bevy for drawing lines (why not).\r\n\r\nThis work is part of a bigger effort to make the bevy rendering pipeline more modular. I would like to contribute an exemple to render custom meshes without `bevy_pbr`. Something like [this](https://github.com/rambip/plant-mesh/blob/main/src/shader/mod.rs)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nNow, `bevy_pbr` is an optional dependency, and used only to debug lights.\r\n\r\nI query the `ViewUniforms` manually, instead of using `bevy_pbr` to get the heavy `MeshViewLayout`\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI'm not used to testing with bevy at all, but I was able to use successfully in my project.\r\nIt might break for some different mesh pipelines, but I don't think so.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fa22d1c-8b4f-456b-a74b-1a579449e9f5)\r\nSo nice ...\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nI don't think there is any breaking change\r\n\r\n\r\n# Remaining work\r\n\r\nBefore merging it, it would be useful to:\r\n- rewrite the `pipeline_2d.rs` logic to remove the `bevy_sprite` depedency too\r\n- move `view.rs` to `bevy_render`, so that it can be used in a more modular way.\r\n~~- include the most recent changes from 0.16~~","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17581/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
