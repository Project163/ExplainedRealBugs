Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #14465\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAlters `ReflectMapEntities` to operate more like `MapEntities` by making it operate on the component itself rather than the `World` post-insertion. As a result, `Observers` never see the in-between state where the scene component has been added, but hasn't yet had its entities mapped.\r\n\r\nAlso brings it more in-line with `MapEntities` by accepting a generic `DynEntityMapper` rather than relying on the `EntityHashMap` and `SceneEntityMapper` implementation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* New unit test for `Observer`s + `DynamicScene`s\r\n* New unit test for `Observer`s + `Scene`s\r\n* Open to suggestions for other tests!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- The existing `map_entities` and `map_all_entities` methods have been renamed to `map_world_entities` and `map_all_world_entities` respectively and marked as deprecated.\r\n  - Figured I'd leave these in some form since the new method isn't exactly a drop-in replacement.\r\n  - ~This is in a separate commit so that they'll be easy to fully remove later.~ Edit: Oops, I forgot I did this and squashed it away. Oh well, should still be easy to remove them if/when desired.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14549/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14549/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"jrobsonchase","id":1553581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTM1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1553581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase","html_url":"https://github.com/jrobsonchase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-23T20:28:25Z","updated_at":"2024-09-23T20:28:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15398","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15398/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15398/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15398/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15398","id":2543596837,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U858a-Xw","number":15398,"title":"bevy_ecs: flush entities after running observers and hooks in despawn","user":{"login":"jrobsonchase","id":1553581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTM1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1553581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase","html_url":"https://github.com/jrobsonchase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619323,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Bug","name":"C-Bug","color":"d73a4a","default":false,"description":"An unexpected or incorrect behavior"},{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.
