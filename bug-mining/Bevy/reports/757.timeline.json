Or rather, there's a deeper bug lurking. Turns out `add_loaded_labeled_asset` is just kinda broken. When you do an immediate load of an asset, it assigns the path of the asset you are nested-loading. So if you are loading asset \"a.txt\", and within you load \"b.ron\", subassets of the second asset will have a path of \"b.ron#subasset1\", rather than \"a.txt#subasset1\".

Nested asset loading is weird...\n\n(Also to be clear, this is all addressing that \"deeper bug\" I mentioned above).\n\nThe problem is that before #15481, `LoadedAsset` had two functions:\n\n1. It was the type you get from `LoadContext::finish` for a subasset in the current loader.\n2. It was the type you get from `NestedLoader<StaticTyped, Immediate>::load`.\n\nThis means `LoadedAsset::labeled_assets` could store two kinds of assets:\n\n1. Subassets of subassets.\n2. Subassets of a dependency that you did a nested load for.\n\n#15481 (my PR) assumed we were only holding the first kind of asset. However this is a problem for the second kind of asset. The nested asset loaded the asset assuming the path was for the nested asset. That means the handles are all related to the path \"nested#subasset_name\". After #15481, when we merge the `labeled_assets` of a `CompleteLoadedAsset` coming from a nested load, we **don't** give them a new handle related to the root asset. So even though we treat it as a subasset (requiring uniqueness), we can't access it like a subasset (\"root#subasset_name\").\n\nWe could prevent registering nested-loaded assets as subassets, but then any handles you get from that nested load are useless. *Unless* we register these nested-loaded assets as such in `LoadContext`. This would make these nested-loaded assets no longer subassets, but correspond to their \"real\" counterparts. I think this is the path I am going to explore.\n\nNested asset loading is *very* weird. It's not just parsing bytes - it can load another actual asset. I think we need to take a more general look and redesign nested asset loading. I have a feeling we can consolidate a lot of the loading stuff. But I digress.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2708448307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andriyDev","id":22285953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22285953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev","html_url":"https://github.com/andriyDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2708463003","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18010#issuecomment-2708463003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18010","id":2708463003,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86hb92b","user":{"login":"andriyDev","id":22285953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22285953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev","html_url":"https://github.com/andriyDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-08T19:41:12Z","updated_at":"2025-03-08T19:41:12Z","body":"There's another issue creeping up that I'm not sure how to handle. AFAICT, nested-loading an asset path **with a label** is broken. Unless I'm missing something, it will give you the root asset when you requested the labeled asset. Unfortunately, we're in a bind to fix this. If we properly return the labeled asset, we won't know which subassets are relevant to that subasset (since we remove that information when we merge subassets of subassets). So any handles in that subasset can't be found, so we can't package them up into CompleteLoadedAsset, and we can't register them in the root loader. Before #15481, this was more likely to work correctly (since we could register subassets to their \"parent\" subasset), though it still wasn't guaranteed.\n\nOne immediate solution: we could just panic if you pass a label when doing a nested asset load.

Objective\r\n\r\n- Prevents #18291.\r\n- Previously, attempting to direct-nested-load a subasset would return the root of the nested-loaded asset. This is most problematic when doing direct-nested-**untyped**-loads of subassets, where you may not even realize you're dealing with the entirely wrong asset (at least with typed loads, *most of the time* the root asset has a different type from the subasset, and so at least you'd get an error that the types don't match).\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- We now return an error when doing these kinds of loads.\r\n\r\nNote an alternative would be to \"solve\" this problem, by just looking up the appropriate subasset after doing the nested load. However there's two problems: 1) we don't know which subassets of the root asset are necessary for the subasset we are looking up (so any handles in that subasset may never get registered), 2) a solution will likely hamper attempts to resolve #18010. AFAICT, no one has complained about this issue, so it doesn't seem critical to fix this for now.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Added a test to ensure this returns an error. I also checked that the error before this was just a mismatched type error, meaning it was trying to pass off the root asset type `CoolText` as the subasset type `SubText` (which would have worked had I not been using typed loads).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18213/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16646081852,"node_id":"DEME_lADODf6-U86rSzUxzwAAAAPgLw08","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16646081852","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-09T21:43:09Z","milestone":{"title":"0.16"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"andriyDev","id":22285953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22285953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev","html_url":"https://github.com/andriyDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-13T06:55:13Z","updated_at":"2025-03-13T06:55:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18295","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18295/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18295/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18295/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18295","id":2916057076,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86OdGEE","number":18295,"title":"Fix

Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #18010.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- When performing a nested immediate asset load, the asset is stored in the `LoadContext`. Users are only given a `NestedAssetRef`/`NestedErasedAssetRef` which is merely an immutable reference to the assets.\r\n- Once the \"outer\" asset finishes loading, any nested immediate assets it had loaded also get sent to the asset system (along with the outer asset). This will either refresh the asset if it was already loaded, or it will now be loaded (unless the handle gets dropped).\r\n- Users no longer need to (and can't) add nested immediate assets as subassets.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Updated the existing `load_dependencies` test to account for the fact that nested immediate loaded assets now modify the previously loaded assets.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\n- Nested, immediate asset loads **that use a custom reader** will not give you ownership of the value. These must be accessed through a handle (or cloned). The `asset_decompression` example is relevant here: it needed to be refactored to no longer need to store the decompressed asset.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nNested, immediate asset loads no longer return a `CompleteLoadedAsset`/`CompleteErasedLoadedAsset`. Instead they return a handle to the asset and a `NestedAssetRef`/`NestedErasedAssetRef` to access its data. Previously, nested asset loads could look like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet loaded_asset = load_context.loader().immediate().load<Image>(\"nested_asset.png\").await?;\r\nlet image = loaded_asset.get_asset();\r\n// Access the image here, or even call `.take()` to take inner asset!\r\n\r\nlet handle = load_context.add_loaded_labeled_asset(\"this_is_nested\", image);\r\n// Store this handle somewhere.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow these nested assets are \"registered\" for you.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet (handle, loaded_asset) = load_context.loader().immediate().load<Image>(\"nested_asset.png\").await?;\r\nlet image = loaded_asset.get_asset();\r\n// Access the image here, but we can't `.take()` it anymore...\r\n// Store this handle somewhere.\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16745211134,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86rSzUxzwAAAAPmF6T-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16745211134","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"adbb53b87f146b8750cb932ca4deb4f875d3e6b6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/adbb53b87f146b8750cb932ca4deb4f875d3e6b6","created_at":"2025-03-13T16:59:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16745211474,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86rSzUxzwAAAAPmF6ZS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16745211474","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-13T16:59:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2722013449","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18010#issuecomment-2722013449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18010","id":2722013449,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86iPqEJ","user":{"login":"andriyDev","id":22285953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22285953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev","html_url":"https://github.com/andriyDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-13T17:02:26Z","updated_at":"2025-03-13T17:02:26Z","body":"Woops
