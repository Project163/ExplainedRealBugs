questions regarding that setting:\r\n\r\n- This is technically a per window setting since this is exposed by the surface. While I don't see a use case were the user would want that value to vary per-window, for consistency with other settings like the present mode it may make sense for the user-override to be something like a `Option<NonZeroU32>` on `Window`/`ExtractedWindow`?\r\n- Wouldn't keeping 2 as the default even when pipeline rendering is disabled prevent stalling on the cpu side if a frame takes longer than the others on the gpu side? I guess this would need some latency benchmarking to see the actual effect of that change.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2053629849/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Kanabenki","id":18357657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzU3NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18357657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanabenki","html_url":"https://github.com/Kanabenki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanabenki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanabenki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanabenki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanabenki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanabenki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanabenki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanabenki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanabenki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kanabenki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2053656380","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12930#issuecomment-2053656380","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12930","id":2053656380,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U856aE88","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-13T14:06:35Z","updated_at":"2024-04-13T14:06:35Z","body":">  it may make sense for the user-override to be something like a Option<NonZeroU32> on Window/ExtractedWindow\r\n\r\nAgreed.
