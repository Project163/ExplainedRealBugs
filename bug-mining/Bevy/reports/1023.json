If `Resource` must be `'static`, then why didn't it error out when I `derive`d it? I tried expanding the macro and found that this is what it expanded to:\n```rust\nimpl<\n    #[expect(single_use_lifetimes, reason = \"Deriving from Resource causes this.\")]\n    #[expect(redundant_lifetimes, reason = \"Deriving from Resource causes this.\")] 'window,\n> bevy_ecs::resource::Resource for WgpuResource<'window>\nwhere\n    Self: Send + Sync + 'static,\n{\n}\n```\n\nBecause of the `where` clause, this `impl` is skipped for `WgpuResource` because it isn't `'static`. If I remove the `where` clause, then it correctly tells me that the lifetime bound isn't satisfied.\n\n## What went wrong\n\nI expected that the macro wouldn't add that `where` clause, so the user can see the problem sooner.\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20413/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
