Objective\r\n\r\n- closes #15866\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Simply migrate where possible.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Expect that CI will do most of the work. Examples is another way of testing this, as most of the work is in that area.\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nFor now, this PR doesn't migrate `QueryState::single` and friends as for now, this look like another issue. So for example, QueryBuilders that used single or `World::query` that used single wasn't migrated. If there is a easy way to migrate those, please let me know.\r\n\r\nMost of the uses of `Query::single` were removed, the only other uses that I found was related to tests of said methods, so will probably be removed when we remove `Query::single`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15872/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15872/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14620567792,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86Z7Pj8zwAAAANndCjw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14620567792","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d96a9d15f6dd6730fe2908d44faa2c662711945c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/d96a9d15f6dd6730fe2908d44faa2c662711945c","created_at":"2024-10-13T20:49:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14620567828,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86Z7Pj8zwAAAANndCkU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14620567828","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-13T20:49:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
