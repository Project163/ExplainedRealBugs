Objective\r\nFixes #11821. \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n* Run `System::apply_deferred` in `System::run` after executing the system.\r\n* Switch to using `System::run_unsafe` in `SingleThreadedExecutor` to preserve the current behavior.\r\n* Remove the `System::apply_deferred` in `SimpleExecutor` as it's now redundant.\r\n* Remove the `System::apply_deferred` when running one-shot systems, as it's now redundant. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\nChanged: `System::run` will now immediately apply deferred system params after running the system.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n`System::run` will now always run `System::apply_deferred` immediately after running the system now. If you were running systems and then applying their deferred buffers at a later point in time, you can eliminate the latter.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// in 0.13\r\nsystem.run(world);\r\n// .. sometime later
