Objective\r\n\r\n Fixes #14540\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Clean slab layouts from stale `SlabId`s when freeing meshes\r\n- Technically performance requirements of freeing now increase based on the number of existing meshes, but maybe it doesn't matter too much in practice\r\n- This was the case before this PR too, but it's technically possible to free and allocate 2^32 times and overflow with `SlabId`s and cause incorrect behavior. It looks like new meshes would then override old ones.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Tested in `loading_screen` example and tapping keyboard 1 and
