I'm trying to get a list of all components with code like this:\n\n```\nfor ty in type_registry.iter() {\n    if ty.contains::<ReflectComponent>() {\n        println!(\"component: {ty:?}\");\n    } else {\n        println!(\"not a component: {ty:?}\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\nThere are a few components that don't have a ReflectComponent, for example `bevy_render::sync_world::TemporaryRenderEntity`:\n\n```\nTypeRegistration { type_info: Struct(StructInfo { ty: bevy_render::sync_world::TemporaryRenderEntity, generics: Generics([]), fields: [], field_names: [], field_indices: {}, custom_attributes: {}, docs: Some(\" Marker component that indicates that its entity needs to be despawned at the end of the frame.\") }) }\n```\n\nThere are probably more of those. I can't find anything specific that differentiates them from other components where this code works.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16659/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
