places.\r\n\r\nwhat remains, is maybe we should add some `warn!` ? at least in picking.\r\nCurrently in sprite picking backend if the pixel data couldn't be accessed (to determine if the alpha is greater than the threshold), the entity is skipped. maybe a `warn!` here at least ?\r\n\r\n(imo it shouldn't be skipped, instead be taken as if it was valid: id rather have a sprite where the whole
