Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #14844\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- implement reflect using the `impl_reflect_value` macro\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- I wrote a test locally to understand and learn how reflection worked on a basic level and to confirm that yes indeed the bound struct could use the reflection traits that have been implemented for it.\r\n\r\nnote: I did remove a line that asked for bound to not have reflect implemented in a test, since that's the point of this PR and the test worked without the line so I am not sure what that was about, not sure if that uncovers a deeper issue or not.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14861/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13985648699,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86TqYBnzwAAAANBnBA7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13985648699","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f9fbd08f9f520f2d139fc3d3fdac3d7e686e58b1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/f9fbd08f9f520f2d139fc3d3fdac3d7e686e58b1","created_at":"2024-08-22T23:17:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13985648783,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86TqYBnzwAAAANBnBCP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13985648783","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-22T23:17:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
