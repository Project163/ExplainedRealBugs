Objective\r\n\r\nAdd documentation useful to users of `bevy_ecs` not also using `App`.\r\n\r\nFixes #19270.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n* Add explanation of labels to `Schedule` documentation.\r\n* Add example of `derive(ScheduleLabel)` to `trait ScheduleLabel`.\r\n* Add a third example to `Schedule` which demonstrates using a schedule via label instead of owning it directly.\r\n* Add further explanation and links to `World::add_schedule()`, and `World::run_schedule()`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nReviewed generated documentation.\r\n\r\nPlease review this documentation carefully for correctness, as I have little experience with `bevy_ecs` and I am adding this information because it would have helped my own past confusion, but I may still be wrong about how things should be done.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19329/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2899286353","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19270#issuecomment-2899286353","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19270","id":2899286353,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86sz5lR","user":{"login":"kpreid","id":779501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTUwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/779501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpreid","html_url":"https://github.com/kpreid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpreid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpreid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpreid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpreid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpreid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpreid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpreid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpreid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kpreid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-21T21:25:24Z","updated_at":"2025-05-21T21:25:24Z","body":"PR
