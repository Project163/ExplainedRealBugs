My goal was to remove the need of iterating children looking for marker components.\n\n```rust\n// The relationship declaration\n#[derive(Component)]\n#[relationship(relationship_target = HairOf)]\npub struct HasHair(Entity);\n\nimpl HasHair {\n    pub fn new(hair: Entity) -> Self {\n        HasHair(hair)\n    }\n}\n\n#[derive(Component)]\n#[relationship_target(relationship = HasHair)]\npub struct HairOf(Entity);\n\n// Setup\nlet hair_entity = commands.spawn(Hair(character.get_hair())).id();\n\ncommands\n    .entity(character_entity)\n    .insert((\n        Name::new(character.get_name()),\n        HasHair::new(hair_entity),\n    ))\n    .add_child(hair_entity);\n\n\n\n// later in a system\ncommands.despawn(character_entity);\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\nIt panicked with the following:\n\n```\nEncountered an error in command `<<models::greenfeet::body::HasHair as bevy_ecs::relationship::Relationship>::on_replace::{{closure}} as bevy_ecs::error::command_handling::CommandWithEntity<core::result::Result<(), bevy_ecs::world::error::EntityMutableFetchError>>>::with_entity::{{closure}}`: The entity with ID 97670v1 was despawned by .cargo\\registry\\src\\index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f\\bevy_ecs-0.16.0-rc.5\\src\\relationship\\mod.rs:255:21\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18905/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18905/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
