I'm not sure what the cleanest way to do this is from an implementation perspective, since the `$ident` pattern doesn't match tuple struct field indices and I'm not sure if it makes sense to use `$literal`, as that matches more than just field indices.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\n- Add an alternative easy way to animate tuple structs (e.g. a separate macro/type)\n- Maybe something could be done with `Deref` and a blanket implementation of `AnimatableProperty`? But this puts the burden on components to implement `Deref`, only works for tuple structs with single fields, and also introduces potential conflicts with trait implementations because it would be a blanket implementation\n\n## Additional context\n\nI was specifically trying to animate UI color alpha when I ran into this, and I wonder if it's worth considering if there should be easy ways to get a `&mut` to a `Color`'s alpha and also possibly animate individual fields of a component's fields (e.g. animating `Transform::translation::x`), but that's a separate issue and probably a little more complicated.\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16736/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
