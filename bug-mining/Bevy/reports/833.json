We use `0.25`, where the latest is `0.26`. I suggest we update it.\n\nThe [changelog](https://github.com/AccessKit/accesskit/releases/tag/accesskit_winit-v0.26.0) lists only one (breaking) change:\n\n> Panic if the window is visible when the adapter is created, for adapters where this is a problem\n\nNormally, I would post a PR for this myself - and I even checked if simply changing the version number would fail to build or fail CI (neither failed - [CI run here](https://github.com/LikeLakers2/bevy/actions/runs/14808794796), and [here's a copy of the CI logs](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20022514/logs_38035210396.zip) if it's no longer available).\n\nBut as I don't have any knowledge of `bevy_winit`'s internals, nor any idea if this change would cause any issues, I'm making this issue.\n\nThank you for your time.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19040/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
