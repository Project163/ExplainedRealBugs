What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nThere are two common patterns in many Bevy applications.\r\n1. **Game menu**: Game menus are separated from game worlds by `States`. Typically it's a global enum with `WorldState::Menu` and `WorldState::Game` variants. When going `WorldState::Game -> WorldState::Menu`, a *lot* of cleanup is necessary. See issue https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12852 for a great example.\r\n2. **Asset to resource**: When an app starts up, some resources are loaded from assets and inserted into the world. The world often uses a global `States` enum to separate the loading phase from runtime systems. This pattern is especially distinct for headless apps where `AssetServer` is only used to load config resources on startup. After loading is done, the global `States` only exist to filter out the initial loading systems, which stay in the app.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, Bevy app design is currently *monolithic*. One world per application, one world to control all logic and data. Architecturally, monolithic worlds are restrictive and require various hacks around `States` and comprehensive cleanup systems to artificially construct distinct 'sub-worlds' within a single `World`. Even when you hack together internal 'sub-worlds', there is risk of data leakage between partitions, and it becomes difficult to clean up dead 'sub-worlds' entirely and reliably.\r\n\r\nThis problem is unique to an ECS engine because the ECS is a kind of data-control singleton with mostly manual allocation management (entity spawn/despawn, resource insert/remove).\r\n\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nInstead of one world per application, I'd like to use multiple worlds per application. One world at a time can control the event loop and windows, but worlds can do hand-offs when the user swaps between partitions of the application.\r\n\r\nWith a multi-world-swapping design, the menu/game separation becomes much more straightforward since game worlds can be cleaned up completely by just dropping them (and only recovering exactly those resources you want to recover).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the `load -> headless app` sequence becomes much cleaner and more concise.\r\n\r\nIt turns out world-swapping is quite straightforward to implement, and only a few minor changes are required to the Bevy codebase to achieve the necessary level of abstraction. I implemented world-swapping in [this experimental crate](https://github.com/UkoeHB/bevy_worldswap) using a branch of Bevy that has the changes in the following small PRs:\r\n- [x] Add `Clone` to `WinitSettings` to facilitate moving windows between foreground worlds. https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12787\r\n- [ ] Export `CachedWindow` so swapped-in worlds can be synced with windows it doesn't know about yet. https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12785\r\n- [ ] Split out a section of `WinitPlugin` into `WinitCorePlugin` so secondary worlds can hook up to `winit` without creating an event loop. https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12786\r\n- [ ] Refresh `SystemStates` used by the `winit` event loop when the primary `World` running in the loop changes. https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12788\r\n- [ ] Tie access kit root nodes to `winit` window ids instead of entity ids, so the root nodes can be transferred between worlds. https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12799\r\n- [ ] (optional) Don't make `AssetServer` in `AssetPlugin` if an `AssetServer` already exists. This makes it easier to reuse `AssetServer` between worlds. It is *optional* and I might just close this because it sounds like in the future `AssetServer` will be more deeply embedded in the ECS. https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12790\r\n\r\nNote that the world-swapping approach I implemented uses separate render worlds for each 'swappable' world. The surface area between swappable worlds and an `App` is quite small. Swapping is mostly transferring window information and hooking up foreground worlds to the event loop.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nA few solutions have been proposed:\r\n- Dynamic plugins\r\n- Entity namespacing\r\n- Just keep hacking things together\r\n\r\nWhile it's certainly useful to have more ECS tools, unfortunately dynamic plugins and entity namespacing are both far away from Bevy today, and are far more complex to implement than world swapping. They are also probably more complex to actually use (and use correctly) in practice. World-swapping is easy to use, and low-cost to support in Bevy.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n-

Solution\r\n\r\n- Added `bevy_hierarchy` to default features of `bevy_state`.\r\n- Move `log_transitions` to `transitions` module.\r\n- Move `StateScoped`  to `state_scoped` module, gated behind `bevy_hierarchy` feature.\r\n- Refreshed implementation.\r\n- Added `enable_state_coped_entities<S: States>()` to add required machinery to `App` for clearing state-scoped entities.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Added `log_transitions` for displaying state transitions.\r\n- Added `StateScoped` for binding entity lifetime to state and app `enable_state_coped_entities` to register cleaning
