One of the methods it does not mirror is `resource_scope`. If you need to use `resource_scope` in a context where you have an `EntityWorldMut`, such as an `EntityCommand`, you currently need to deconstruct and then reconstruct it like so:\n```rust\nlet id = entity_world_mut.id();\nlet world = entity_world_mut.into_world_mut();\nworld.resource_scope::<_, _>(|world, res| {\n    let entity_world_mut = world.entity_mut(id);\n    /* ... */\n});\n```\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nAdd `resource_scope` and `try_resource_scope` methods to `EntityWorldMut` that mirror the corresponding methods on `World`.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\n- Change methods like `EntityCommand::apply`, `BundleEffect::apply`, and anything else that takes an `EntityWorldMut` as a parameter, to instead separately take an `Entity` and a `&mut World` as parameters.\n- Continue using the aforementioned workaround.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20139/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
