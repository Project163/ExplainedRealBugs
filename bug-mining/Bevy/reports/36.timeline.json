What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nThe rounded corners PR

contains the width and height of the UI node. This should be added to the custom `UiMaterial` pipeline as well: may custom shaders will want to be able to render pixel-accurate shapes, and this is hard to do without knowing how u/v values correspond with actual pixels.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, one might want to write a shader that maintains a proper aspect ratio of the rendered content, even when the ui node is resized. This is fairly easy to do if you know the width and height of the UI node.\r\n\r\nWithout this, writing a custom UI shader that understands aspect ratios or pixel sizes is very difficult, as it requires re-implementing the entire render pipeline for UI nodes.\r\n\r\n@ickshonpe @alice-i-cecile \r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nSimply to add an additional attribute `[f32;2]`

Solution\r\n\r\nAdded the node size to the UiMaterial vertex shader params and also to the data that is passed to the fragment shader.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThis change should be backwards compatible, using the new field is optional.\r\n\r\nNote to reviewers: render pipelines are a bit outside my comfort zone, so please make sure I haven't made any mistakes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11722/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11720893187,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U858ZfDtzwAAAAK6nqMD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11720893187","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a57832bc9a7bc815dc92b905df5b9130ddec0e7c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/a57832bc9a7bc815dc92b905df5b9130ddec0e7c","created_at":"2024-02-06T16:28:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11720893424,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U858ZfDtzwAAAAK6nqPw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11720893424","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-06T16:28:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
