What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to get or create a `ComponentId` with just `TypeId` (and `TypeRegistry`) assuming a given type reflects the required trait. This currently can only be done if a given component/resource has already been initialized (with `Components::get_id` and `Components::get_resource_id`).\r\n\r\nA specific example: a scripting language that wants to check for existance of a resource/component (on an entity) where the resource resource/component is defined in rust.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nFor `ReflectComponent`:\r\n- add a new function that takes `&mut World` and calls `world.init_component::<T>()`\r\n\r\nFor `ReflectResource`:\r\n- would require adding a new method to `World` that initializes a resource without inserting \r\n  - NOTE: based on current naming convention this should be called `init_resource` which is already used. #15451 proposes a rename of this group of methods. This would mean the new method would be called `register_resource<T>`\r\n  - NOTE: this is _different_ than #15448 as this method should return the same `ComponentId` for the same type if called multiple times\r\n- add a new function that takes `&mut World` and calls this new function\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\n- Require users to manually register all resources/components they are planning to use first (this is what I'm currently doing)\r\n- Somehow initialize all registered types that `#[reflect(Component, Resource)]` automatically when registering a type inside of the type registry.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15453/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"hooded-shrimp","id":182684536,"node_id":"U_kgDOCuOLeA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/182684536?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp","html_url":"https://github.com/hooded-shrimp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-26T19:35:22Z","updated_at":"2024-09-26T19:35:22Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15454","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15454/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15454/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15454/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15454","id":2551393520,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U8581xxi","number":15454,"title":"Rename init_component & friends","user":{"login":"hooded-shrimp","id":182684536,"node_id":"U_kgDOCuOLeA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/182684536?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp","html_url":"https://github.com/hooded-shrimp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hooded-shrimp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":2747857990,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODU3OTkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Usability","name":"C-Usability","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A targeted quality-of-life change that makes Bevy easier to use"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.
