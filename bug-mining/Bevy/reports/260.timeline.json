all,\r\n\r\nI took some time to look into this issue for a first contribution, and here is what I've found so far.\r\n\r\nThe printed-out error corresponds to the following enum variant:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3bfc42766621d12749c09eca3bfd9911dc0dc3f5/crates/bevy_render/src/render_resource/pipeline_cache.rs#L1016C1-L1022C38\r\n\r\nFrom the variant's name & its error message, it seems like it's trying to cover different issues (all related to shader loading, but still different); However, I could only find two usages of the variant in the source code, only one of which being a return:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3bfc42766621d12749c09eca3bfd9911dc0dc3f5/crates/bevy_render/src/render_resource/pipeline_cache.rs#L276C1-L288C62\r\n\r\nAll occurences (cross-checked in my IDE): \r\n```bash\r\ngrep -rn --include=\"*.rs\" \"ShaderNotLoaded\"\r\n# ./crates/bevy_render/src/render_resource/pipeline_cache.rs:288 : .ok_or(PipelineCacheError::ShaderNotLoaded(id))?; (!)\r\n# ./crates/bevy_render/src/render_resource/pipeline_cache.rs:929 : PipelineCacheError::ShaderNotLoaded(_)\r\n# ./crates/bevy_render/src/render_resource/pipeline_cache.rs:1022: ShaderNotLoaded(AssetId<Shader>),\r\n```\r\nI'm willing to make a PR to fix this, but I'm not sure how it should be handled. Was there a greater motivation behind the current message (or a previous usage deleted at some point) that would justify having a `ShaderNotLoadedYet` variant? My guess is that it may relate to this `else` block during shader imports:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3bfc42766621d12749c09eca3bfd9911dc0dc3f5/crates/bevy_render/src/render_resource/pipeline_cache.rs#L422C1-L455C1\r\n\r\nThe easy alternative would be to replace the current message with something along those line:\r\n\r\n`Pipeline could not be compiled because the following shader could not be loaded:

Is there anything specific they need to know?\r\n\r\nOne should be able to preview the changes by running any example after deleting/renaming their associated shader(s).\r\n\r\n> If relevant, what platforms did you test these changes on, and are there any important ones you can't test?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13766/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13101679918,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86K8ts6zwAAAAMM68Uu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13101679918","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2356276afd78a523f3511f8b389fba5fd79855e7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/2356276afd78a523f3511f8b389fba5fd79855e7","created_at":"2024-06-10T13:33:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13101680133,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86K8ts6zwAAAAMM68YF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13101680133","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-10T13:33:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13105243275,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86K8ts6zwAAAAMNIiSL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13105243275","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c060e3e1fec9a0c17bad5461916fff3f4b8d7037","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/c060e3e1fec9a0c17bad5461916fff3f4b8d7037","created_at":"2024-06-10T17:31:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
