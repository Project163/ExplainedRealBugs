is solved, I opened it just for documentation sake; feel free to close)\n## The Problem\nWhen trying to run a skein project from the template on the site:\n\n```\nbevy new -t rust-adventure/skein --branch template-minimal my-newest-project\n```\n\nI got the following error:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad6077f1-8316-4277-a87f-808f55ebca44)\n```\nerror: expected expression, found `?`\n...\nerror: format argument must be a string literal\n```\n(If anyone has a textual copy of the actual error messages, please comment it for easier googling)\n\n\nThe problem, according to @ChristopherBiscardi (https://discord.com/channels/891597669926043648/899326004428959754/1360605337224216646), is that bevy 0.16.0-rc.4 broke some logging related macros, so (my interpertation) skein probably uses the wrong `trace!` macros.\n\nThe reason it affects skein is due to https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/12333, which makes cargo take 0.16.0-rc.4 instead of rc.1.\n\n## The solution\nChris provided me with the following dependencies section, that fixes it:\n(You can slot it into a project initialized with the `bevy new` I put at the
