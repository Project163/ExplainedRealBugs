Objective\r\n\r\n  - Fixes #20008 - Preconvert colors before sending them to the UI gradients shader for better performance\r\n\r\n  ## Solution\r\n\r\n  - Modified `prepare_gradient` in `gradient.rs` to convert colors from `LinearRgba` to `Srgba` on the CPU before sending to the GPU\r\n  - Updated the gradient shader to remove per-pixel color space conversions since colors are now pre-converted\r\n  - Added documentation to clarify that vertex colors are in sRGB space\r\n\r\n  This optimization reduces the number of power operations per pixel from 3 to 1:\r\n  - **Before**: Convert start color to sRGB, convert end color to sRGB, mix, convert back to linear (3 pow operations per pixel)\r\n  - **After**: Colors pre-converted on CPU, mix in sRGB space, convert back to linear (1 pow operation per pixel)\r\n\r\n  ## Testing\r\n\r\n  - Verified that the UI gradient examples (`cargo run --example gradients`) compile and render correctly\r\n  - The visual output should remain identical while performance improves, especially for large gradient areas\r\n  - Changes maintain the same color interpolation behavior (mixing in sRGB space)\r\n\r\n  To test:\r\n  1. Run `cargo run --example gradients` or `cargo run --example stacked_gradients`\r\n  2. Verify gradients render correctly","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20073/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20073/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"tylercritchlow","id":12092753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDkyNzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12092753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow","html_url":"https://github.com/tylercritchlow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-10T02:48:23Z","updated_at":"2025-07-10T02:48:23Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20074","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20074/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20074/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20074/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/20074","id":3217694399,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86eN_Fc","number":20074,"title":"Preconvert colors before sending to shader","user":{"login":"tylercritchlow","id":12092753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDkyNzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12092753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow","html_url":"https://github.com/tylercritchlow","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tylercritchlow/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2045383863,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQ1MzgzODYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-Rendering","name":"A-Rendering","color":"C6A751","default":false,"description":"Drawing game state to the screen"},{"id":2272098452,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjcyMDk4NDUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Performance","name":"C-Performance","color":"B8B8B8","default":false,"description":"A change motivated by improving speed, memory usage or compile times"},{"id":2276469463,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjc2NDY5NDYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-UI","name":"A-UI","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Graphical user interfaces, styles, layouts, and widgets"},{"id":2287994822,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjg3OTk0ODIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Code-Quality","name":"C-Code-Quality","color":"B8B8B8","default":false,"description":"A section of code that is hard to understand or change"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Objective\r\n\r\n  - Fixes #20008 - Preconvert colors before sending them to the UI gradients shader for better performance\r\n\r\n  ## Solution\r\n\r\n  - Modified `prepare_gradient` in `gradient.rs` to convert colors from `LinearRgba` to `Srgba` on the CPU before sending to the GPU\r\n  - Updated the gradient shader to remove per-pixel color space conversions since colors are now pre-converted\r\n  - Added documentation to clarify that vertex colors are in sRGB space\r\n\r\n  This optimization reduces the number of power operations per pixel from 3 to 1:\r\n  - **Before**: Convert start color to sRGB, convert end color to sRGB, mix, convert back to linear (3 pow operations per pixel)\r\n  - **After**: Colors pre-converted on CPU, mix in sRGB space, convert back to linear (1 pow operation per pixel)\r\n\r\n  ## Testing\r\n\r\n  - Verified that the UI gradient examples (`cargo run --example gradients`) compile and render correctly\r\n  - The visual output should remain identical while performance improves, especially for large gradient areas\r\n  - Changes maintain the same color interpolation behavior (mixing in sRGB space)\r\n\r\n  To test:\r\n  1.
