But sometimes we may have some unstable frame rate that may fluctuate from 30+ FPS to 40+ FPS where we can hardly say what the specific frame rate is(I just met this problem recently, and I may add a video example of that if I am available tomorrow).\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nAdd `interval` (or other name, I am not good at naming) field, and the FPS displayed will be the average fps of the past interval duration.\n\n```rust\nApp::new()\n        .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, FpsOverlayPlugin {\n            config: FpsOverlayConfig {\n                interval: bevy::utils::Duration::from_millis(200),\n                ..default()\n            },\n        }))\n        .add_systems(Startup, setup)\n        .run();\n```\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\n- Write a simple fps overlay plugin myself\n- Use [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner) or Xbox Game Bar\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17487/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
