Specifically, I updated the rotation quaternion in the file. Only restarting the app shows me the change.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nEditing the base color of the [monkey model](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/release-0.11.1/assets/models/monkey/Monkey.gltf) (same example) in version 0.11 seems to work,\r\nthough if I add a rotation quaternion, the monkey's rotation only updates upon restarting the app.\r\n\r\nOn a personal project, I'm listening for image events `AssetEvent<Image>`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn read_image_events(\r\n    mut events: EventReader<AssetEvent<Image>>,\r\n) {\r\n    for event in events.read() {\r\n        println!(\"Got event: {event:?}\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis system runs in the Update schedule.\r\nWhen starting up my game, my console logs the following:\r\n```\r\nGot event: Added { id: AssetId<bevy_render::texture::image::Image>{ index: 3, generation: 0} }\r\nGot event: Added { id: AssetId<bevy_render::texture::image::Image>{ index: 5, generation: 0} }\r\nGot event: Added { id: AssetId<bevy_render::texture::image::Image>{ index: 4, generation: 0} }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter updating / saving an image file image a couple of times, the console log looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGot event: Added { id: AssetId<bevy_render::texture::image::Image>{ index: 3, generation: 0} }  // Old\r\nGot event: Added { id: AssetId<bevy_render::texture::image::Image>{ index: 5, generation: 0} }  // Old\r\nGot event: Added { id: AssetId<bevy_render::texture::image::Image>{ index: 4, generation: 0} }  // Old\r\n2024-08-10T20:33:26.687117Z  INFO bevy_asset::server: Reloading maps\\tilesets\\spring_forest.png because it has changed // New\r\n2024-08-10T20:33:26.769548Z  INFO bevy_asset::server: Reloading maps\\tilesets\\spring_forest.png because it has changed // New\r\n2024-08-10T20:33:39.859572Z  INFO bevy_asset::server: Reloading maps\\tilesets\\spring_forest.png because it has changed // New\r\n2024-08-10T20:33:39.951233Z  INFO bevy_asset::server: Reloading maps\\tilesets\\spring_forest.png because it has changed // New\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe four new lines at the end are bevy's internal logging.\r\nClearly, bevy is detecting the change, but for some reason, it does not fire `AssetEvent::<Image>::Modified` events.\r\n\r\nThe PBR models that I'm spawning do not seem to update either.\r\nThey do update if I restart the app, or do something that causes them to reload manually.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14698/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14698/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
