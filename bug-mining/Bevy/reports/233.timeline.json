Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #13503 \r\n- Fix other various bugs I noticed while debugging above issue.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Change the antialiasing(AA) method. It was using fwidth which is the derivative between pixels, but there were a lot of artifacts being added from this. So just use the sdf value. This aa method probably isn't as smooth looking, but better than having artifacts. Below is a visualization of the fwidth.\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/2180432/4e475ad0-c9d0-4a40-af39-5f4422a78392)\r\n- Use the internal sdf for drawing the background instead of the external sdf and extract the border for these type of nodes. This fixed 2 bugs, one with the background coloring the AA pixels on the edge of rounded borders. And also allows for the border to use a transparent color.\r\n- Don't extract borders if all the widths are zero.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- played a bunch with the example in the linked issue.\r\nThis PR:\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/2180432/d7797e0e-e348-4daa-8646-554dc2032523)\r\nMain:\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/2180432/4d46c17e-a12d-4e20-aaef-0ffc950cefe2)\r\n\r\n-

bevy to 0.12, and after migration I found this weird UI displacement\r\n![图片](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/38809254/ce781539-3bec-4d90-97a5-31098fd96ffa)\r\nIn 0.11, the ui works perfectly.\r\n![图片](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/38809254/b85aba30-04b4-4db6-a1e9-4470d747f520)\r\n\r\nIt happens when window resizes, also it seems that the displacement sometimes will change depending on resolution and presumably UiScale\r\nOn maximum(UiScale is about 1.9)\r\n![image-4](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/38809254/5dd014c0-df29-48e2-80b3-ab6b485f7dbf)\r\nOn fullscreen(UiScale is 2.0)\r\n![image-5](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/38809254/420332ca-7eea-426c-8651-08e4b3ee6140)</div>\r\n\r\nAnd I made a minimal reproduce code\r\n\r\nfor sprite,
