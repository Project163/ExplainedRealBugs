Bevy version\n\n0.16.0-rc.1\n\n## What you did\n\nI was reading the examples for automatic instancing which specify that `MeshTag` can be used to pass per-instance identifiers into shaders. \nI reviewed, the code related to both  Mesh and Mesh2d Uniforms and both contain the `tag` member, but only the `Mesh` WGSL structure has a corresponding `tag` member. \n\nAdditionally the `mesh2d_functions` module is missing the corresponding `get_tag()` function. \n\n## What went wrong\n\nMesh2D WGSL structure definition does not match the `Mesh2dUniform` Rust structure definition. \n\n## Additional info\n\nI added the field to `Mesh2d` in `mesh2d_types.wgsl` in a local Bevy checkout and the appropriate data gets piped through the field.
