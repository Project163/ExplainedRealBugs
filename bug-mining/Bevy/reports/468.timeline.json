Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #15560\r\nFixes (most of) #15570\r\n\r\nCurrently a lot of examples (and presumably some user code) depend on toggling certain render features by adding/removing a single component to an entity, e.g. `SpotLight` to toggle a light. Because of the retained render world this no longer works: Extract will add any new components, but when it is removed the entity persists unchanged in the render world.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdd `SyncComponentPlugin<C: Component>` that registers `SyncToRenderWorld` as a required component for `C`, and adds a component hook that will clear all components from the render world entity when `C` is removed. We add this plugin to `ExtractComponentPlugin` which fixes most instances of the problem. For custom extraction logic we can manually add `SyncComponentPlugin` for that component.\r\n\r\nWe also rename `WorldSyncPlugin` to `SyncWorldPlugin` so we start a naming convention like all the `Extract` plugins.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I also fixed a bunch of breakage related to the retained render world, stemming from old code that assumed that `Entity` would be the same in both worlds.\r\n\r\nI found that using the `RenderEntity` wrapper instead of `Entity` in data structures when referring to render world entities makes intent much clearer, so I propose we make this an official pattern.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nRun examples like\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo run --features pbr_multi_layer_material_textures --example clearcoat\r\ncargo run --example volumetric_fog\r\n```\r\n\r\nand see that they work, and that toggles work correctly. But really we should test every single example, as we might not even have caught all the breakage yet.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThe retained render world notes should be updated to explain this edge case and `SyncComponentPlugin`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14563619193,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86Yhf5OzwAAAANkDzF5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14563619193","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2d1b4939d2b35a7a7ce165c7c188770b8baedb0c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/2d1b4939d2b35a7a7ce165c7c188770b8baedb0c","created_at":"2024-10-08T22:40:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14563619293,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86Yhf5OzwAAAANkDzHd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14563619293","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-08T22:40:34Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
