Objective\r\n\r\nWhen introduced, `Single` was intended to simply be silently skipped, allowing for graceful and efficient handling of systems during invalid game states (such as when the player is dead).\r\n\r\nHowever, this also caused missing resources to *also* be silently skipped, leading to confusing and very hard to debug failures. In 0.15.1, this behavior was reverted to a panic, making missing resources easier to debug, but largely making `Single` (and `Populated`) worthless, as they would panic during expected game states.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the consensus is that this behavior should differ on  a per-system-param basis. However, there was no sensible way to *do* that before this PR.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nSwap `SystemParam::validate_param` from a `bool` to:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n/// The outcome of system / system param validation,\r\n/// used by system executors to determine what to do with a system.\r\npub enum ValidationOutcome {\r\n    /// All system parameters were validated successfully and the system can be run.\r\n    Valid,\r\n    /// At least one system parameter failed validation, and an error must be handled.\r\n    /// By default, this will result in1 a panic. See [crate::error] for more information.\r\n    ///\r\n    /// This is the default behavior, and is suitable for system params that should *always* be valid,\r\n    /// either because sensible fallback behavior exists (like [`Query`] or because\r\n    /// failures in validation should be considered a bug in the user's logic that must be immediately addressed (like [`Res`]).\r\n    Invalid,\r\n    /// At least one system parameter failed validation, but the system should be skipped due to [`ValidationBehavior::Skip`].\r\n    /// This is suitable for system params that are intended to only operate in certain application states, such as [`Single`].\r\n    Skipped,\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen, inside of each `SystemParam` implementation, return either Valid, Invalid or Skipped.\r\n\r\nCurrently, only `Single`, `Option<Single>` and `Populated` use the `Skipped` behavior. Other params (like resources) retain their current failing\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nMessed around with the fallible_params example. Added a pair of tests: one for panicking when resources are missing, and another for properly skipping `Single` and `Populated` system params.\r\n\r\n## To do\r\n\r\n- [x] get https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18454 merged\r\n- [x] fix the todo!() in the macro-powered tuple implementation (please help 🥺)\r\n- [x] test\r\n- [x] write a migration guide\r\n- [x] update the example comments\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nVarious system and system parameter validation methods (`SystemParam::validate_param`, `System::validate_param` and `System::validate_param_unsafe`) now return and accept a `ValidationOutcome` enum, rather than a `bool`.  The previous `true` values map to `ValidationOutcome::Valid`, while `false` maps to `ValidationOutcome::Invalid`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you wrote a custom schedule executor, you should now respect the new `ValidationOutcome::Skipped` parameter, skipping any systems whose validation was skipped. By contrast, `ValidationOutcome::Invalid` systems should also be skipped, but you should call the `default_error_handler` on them first, which by default will result in a panic.\r\n\r\nIf you are implementing a custom `SystemParam`, you should consider whether failing system param validation is an error or an expected state, and choose between `Invalid` and `Skipped` accordingly. In Bevy itself, `Single` and `Populated` now once again skip the system when their conditions are not met. This is the 0.15.0 behavior, but stands in contrast to the 0.15.1 behavior, where they would panic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18504/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2749104692","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18516#issuecomment-2749104692","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18516","id":2749104692,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86j3AI0","user":{"login":"chescock","id":8494645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0OTQ2NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8494645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock","html_url":"https://github.com/chescock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-24T18:49:44Z","updated_at":"2025-03-24T18:49:44Z","body":"We may also want a `Result<T, ???>` param that's like `Option` but lets you distinguish `Skipped` from `Invalid`.  \n\n---\n\nOne use case I had in mind for generic `Option` parameters is [the safe `PipeSystem` example](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/prelude/trait.SystemParamFunction.html#example).  \n\nThe issue there is that regular `PipeSystem` will only validate the parameters to the *first* system, since the first system might change whether the second system should run.  But the example uses `ParamSet`, which currently validates *all* sub-parameters.  \n\nI wanted to be able to write that using `ParamSet<A::Param, Option<B::Param>>` so that the `ParamSet` only validates the first parameter, and then the pipe system can bail out early if the second parameter is `None`.  \n\n... but `Option` isn't quite enough, since we want to return an error on `Invalid` but success on `Skipped`.  So I think we'll eventually want a `Result` wrapper to support higher-order systems.

think the intention of the original behavior of `Option<Single>` is a case where an entity may or may not exist, but should never have duplicates.  Like, you might have a \"current target\" or not, but you never have two.  I think that's more common then a case where you might have any number, but want to run special code when there is exactly one.  \n\nAlthough then the ideal behavior for `Single` might be 0 => Skip, 1 => Valid, N => Invalid.  \n\n(I do prefer having a blanket `Option` impl!

Objective\r\n\r\nChange the behavior of `Single` and `Populated` to fail validation instead of skipping systems.  Users who want the skipping behavior can recover it by wrapping them in `When<T>`.  \r\n\r\nThis is a very controversial change, and there has been a lot of discussion about it!  See some discussion on https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18504#issuecomment-2748338550, which was spun out into #18516, and some later discussion on https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18927#issuecomment-2830728114.  \r\n\r\nI'll try to summarize the arguments here so we don't need to repeat all of them in comments, but let me know if I'm missing or misrepresenting anything and I'll try to update the summary.  (And maintainers should feel free to update it!)  \r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n* A failing version of `Single` is useful for asserting invariants about your model, just as the failing `Res` parameter is useful.\r\n  If we don't change the behavior here, we may need to offer another way to do that.\r\n* A consistent story for when systems skip and when they fail is easier to understand.\r\n  Currently users need to remember the behavior separately for each kind of system parameter, but with this change they would know that systems skip if and only if they write `When`.\r\n* Once we do resources-as-entities, consistency between `Single` and `Res` will be important.\r\n  I expect users to first learn about resources as a separate concept, and later learn that resources are just a special kind of entity. It will be helpful to be able to teach \"`Res` is just a special kind of `Single`\" without needing to qualify \"except that it fails instead of skipping\".\r\n* Making the default behavior be loud helps catch bugs.\r\n  Regardless of the failure behavior, `Single` is more convenient than `Query` when you know you have exactly one entity, so it will be used when the user expects it never to fail. Most of the uses in the Bevy examples are in this category! If it *does* fail, then this is something the user didn't expect and we should inform them. If they do want to skip the system at that point, the error message can guide them to add `When`.  And global error handlers can be used to ensure that anything missed still won't crash the game.\r\n* This is a breaking change, so if we ever want to change it, it's better to change it sooner.\r\n  Most code that uses Bevy hasn't been written yet!  \r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n* A failing version of `Single` is unnecessary now that we have fallible systems.\r\n  Users can use an ordinary `Query` parameter and write a simple `let value = query.single()?` to get erroring behavior, but there is no concise way to get skipping behavior.\r\n* Common cases should be simple.\r\n  The skipping behavior is much more useful than the failing behavior, and will be needed more often. We don't want Bevy to have a reputation for requiring useless boilerplate for common tasks!  \r\n* This is too much churn, part 1\r\n  `Single` is very new, and we should take time to learn how it's being used in practice before making big changes.\r\n* This is too much churn, part 2\r\n  `Single` was introduced in 15.0 with the skipping behavior, and was changed to panic in 15.1 with no workaround. This was a major pain for users who had been eager to use the skipping behavior. The skipping behavior was just restored in 16.0, and breaking it *again* in 17.0 would be really irritating for some of our most enthusiastic users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nChange the behavior of `Single` and `Populated` to fail validation instead of skipping systems.\r\n\r\nWrap them in `When` where needed to fix tests.  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19489/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":4,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19489/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
