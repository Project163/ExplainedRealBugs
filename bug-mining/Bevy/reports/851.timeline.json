problem does this solve or what need does it fill?**\r\n\r\n1.  Powerful mods (think Factorio or Minecraft) may want to modify the game's core code directly. \r\n2. As games grow in size, testing changes becomes increasingly onerous. You need to both recompile and recreate the relevant state in order to see if your change fixed the bug or has the desired gameplay impact. This slows down development velocity significantly, and pushes more and more behaviour into hacky secondary systems (like in-game consoles or dev-specific UI elements) in order to ensure effective testing.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution would you like?**\r\n\r\nLoad in new function definitions from shared object files, allowing changes to game logic while it is running. \r\n\r\nThe basic behaviour outlined in the hotpatch crate works smoothly for mods, but for development, it would be ideal to have it automatically detect changes to the saved source files (when an appropriate flag is set). This behaviour is very similar to the existing hot reloading of assets. \r\n\r\nA few caveats:\r\n\r\n1. Hot reloading relies on shared objects, defined by the ABI. But ABI stability is not guaranteed across Rust compiler versions though, which will need to be carefully considered and documented for this feature. The hotpatch crate recommends using the C ABI for stability, although I'm not knowledgeable enough to speak on the full implications of this choice or feasible alternatives.\r\n2. The ability to modify the underlying engine code might also pose serious security issues for some games, so this should be an opt-in feature, typically turned off for releases.\r\n3. The limitation on not modifying the current function or its parents might be hard to accomplish in ECS given the continually running game loop. As changes to systems seem much more plausible than changes to the underlying scheduler or wrapper logic, you'd likely want to queue up changes until the start of the next time-step (or stage?) to be sure that you're not accidentally replacing a system that's currently executing.\r\n4. The need to annotate functions with `#[patchable]` would get old quickly: we'd need to find some refactoring to replace this requirement with a global feature flag.\r\n\r\n**Describe the alternative(s) you've considered?**\r\n\r\nMods could work by purely adding code, integrating a scripting language, or incorporating this sort of functionality in an external library. The potential benefits to development speed push me towards offering this as a core bit of functionality if possible.\r\n\r\nDevelopment / testing loops might be fast enough with dynamic linking to improve compile times + high quality state saving and loading. Without testing on large code bases, it's unclear what sort of iteration speeds this might offer.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThe new [hotpatch crate](https://crates.io/crates/hotpatch), discussed on reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/kfwtd9/hotpatch_safely_changing_function_definitions_at/) was the inspiration for this feature request, and seems to have some nice technical capabilities. As is, we can't incorporate it due to the GPL license, but we could create an MIT re-implementation or work with its author to change the license.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1095/reactions","total_count":39,"+1":24,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":15,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/1095/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17725828660,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U863QB9AzwAAAAQgiq40","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17725828660","actor":{"login":"jtran","id":10803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran","html_url":"https://github.com/jtran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-20T04:37:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17727707927,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U863QB9AzwAAAAQgp1sX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17727707927","actor":{"login":"bjorn3","id":17426603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI2NjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17426603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3","html_url":"https://github.com/bjorn3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjorn3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-20T07:04:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17731717340,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U863QB9AzwAAAAQg5Ijc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17731717340","actor":{"login":"AntonZelenin","id":15933379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTMzMzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15933379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntonZelenin","html_url":"https://github.com/AntonZelenin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntonZelenin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntonZelenin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntonZelenin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntonZelenin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntonZelenin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntonZelenin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntonZelenin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntonZelenin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AntonZelenin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-20T10:43:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-20T10:50:02Z","updated_at":"2025-05-20T10:50:02Z","source":{"type":

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nFast iteration speed is crucial for successful game development. With Rust, the compilation speed can be much worse compared to other programming languages which makes tasks like tweaking minor game details such as UI or AI behavior tedious. Having the ability to compile functions on the fly while the game is running, even if for the very specific portions of the project, helps.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nAn ability to mark certain Bevy ECS systems as hot-reloadable and have them recompile themselves during runtime when they are changed. Naturally you cannot change the systems' type definitions without recompiling the whole project. To my understanding, this also requires advanced project setup with multiple crates so that the systems can be placed on to a separate crate which will compiled to dynamic library during runtime. Therefore, this would probably be an advanced feature only for users of Bevy ECS crate and not whole Bevy.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nThere is a crate called [hot-lib-reloader-rs](https://github.com/rksm/hot-lib-reloader-rs) that demonstrates how Bevy systems can be hot-reloaded during runtime. **This works only partially**, there are issues when you try to hot-reload system that modify resources or use commands. I have created a repo/branch that demonstrates this issue, [more details can be found here](https://github.com/rksm/hot-lib-reloader-rs/issues/39).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15613/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15613/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17802752620,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U863QB9AzwAAAAQlIHJs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17802752620","actor":{"login":"TapGhoul","id":3120639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjA2Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3120639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TapGhoul","html_url":"https://github.com/TapGhoul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TapGhoul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TapGhoul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TapGhoul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TapGhoul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TapGhoul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TapGhoul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TapGhoul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TapGhoul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TapGhoul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-25T00:49:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
