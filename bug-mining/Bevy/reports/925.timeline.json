#rendering-dev on discord or open a github discussion if you have questions about the long term plan, and keep discussion in this PR limited to the contents of the PR :)\r\n\r\n## Connections\r\n- Works towards #639, #16408.\r\n- Spawned https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18993.\r\n- Need to fix RT stuff in naga_oil first https://github.com/bevyengine/naga_oil/pull/116.\r\n\r\n## This PR\r\n\r\nAfter nearly two years, I've revived the raytraced lighting effort I first started in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10000.\r\n\r\nUnlike that PR, which has realtime techniques, I've limited this PR to:\r\n* `RaytracingScenePlugin` - BLAS and TLAS building, geometry and texture binding, sampling functions.\r\n* `PathtracingPlugin` - A non-realtime path tracer intended to serve as a testbed and reference.\r\n\r\n## What's implemented?\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06522007-c205-46eb-8178-823f19917def)\r\n\r\n* BLAS building on mesh load\r\n* Emissive lights\r\n* Directional lights with soft shadows\r\n* Diffuse (lambert, not Bevy's diffuse BRDF) and emissive materials\r\n* A reference path tracer with:\r\n  * Antialiasing\r\n  * Direct light sampling (next event estimation) with 0/1 MIS weights\r\n  * Importance-sampled BRDF bounces\r\n  * Russian roulette \r\n\r\n## What's _not_ implemented?\r\n* Anything realtime, including a real-time denoiser\r\n* Integration with Bevy's rasterized gbuffer\r\n* Specular materials\r\n* Non-opaque geometry\r\n* Any sort of CPU or GPU optimizations\r\n  * BLAS compaction, proper bindless, and further RT APIs are things that we need wgpu to add\r\n* PointLights, SpotLights, or skyboxes / environment lighting \r\n* Support for materials other than StandardMaterial (and only a subset of properties are supported)\r\n* Skinned/morphed or otherwise animating/deformed meshes\r\n* Mipmaps\r\n* Adaptive self-intersection ray bias\r\n* A good way for developers to detect whether the user's GPU supports RT or not, and fallback to baked lighting.\r\n* Documentation and actual finalized APIs (literally everything is subject to change)\r\n\r\n## End-user Usage\r\n* Have a GPU that supports RT with inline ray queries\r\n* Add `SolariPlugin` to your app\r\n* Ensure any `Mesh` asset you want to use for raytracing has `enable_raytracing: true` (defaults to true), and that it uses the standard uncompressed position/normal/uv_0/tangent vertex attribute set, triangle list topology, and 32-bit indices.\r\n  * If you don't want to build a BLAS and use the mesh for RT, set enable_raytracing to false.\r\n* Add the `RaytracingMesh3d` component to your entity (separate from `Mesh3d` or `MeshletMesh3d`).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Did you test these changes? If so, how? \r\n  - Ran the solari example.\r\n- Are there any parts that need more testing?\r\n  - Other test scenes probably. Normal mapping would be good to test.\r\n- How can other people (reviewers) test your changes? Is there anything specific they need to know?\r\n  - See the solari.rs example for how to setup raytracing.\r\n- If relevant, what platforms did you test these changes on, and are there any important ones you can't test?\r\n  - Windows 11, NVIDIA RTX 3080.
