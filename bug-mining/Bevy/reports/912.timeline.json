Objective\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a robust GPU-based pipeline for dynamically generating environment maps in Bevy. It builds upon PR #19037, allowing these changes to be evaluated independently from the atmosphere implementation.\r\n\r\nWhile existing offline tools can process environment maps, generate mip levels, and calculate specular lighting with importance sampling, they're limited to static file-based workflows. This PR introduces a real-time GPU pipeline that dynamically generates complete environment maps from a single cubemap texture on each frame.\r\n\r\nCloses #9380 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nImplemented a Single Pass Downsampling (SPD) pipeline that processes textures without pre-existing mip levels or pre-filtered lighting data.\r\n\r\nSingle Pass Downsampling (SPD) pipeline:\r\n- accepts any square, power-of-two cubemap up to 8192 × 8192 per face and generates the complete mip chain in one frame;\r\n- copies the base mip (level 0) in a dedicated compute dispatch (`copy_mip0`) before the down-sampling pass;\r\n- performs the down-sampling itself in two compute dispatches to fit within subgroup limits;\r\n- heavily inspired by Jasmine's prototype code.\r\n\r\nPre-filtering pipeline:\r\n- generates the specular Radiance Map using bounded-VNDF GGX importance sampling for higher quality highlights and fewer fireflies;\r\n- computes the diffuse Irradiance Map with cosine-weighted hemisphere sampling;\r\n- mirrors the forward-/reverse-tonemap workflow used by TAA instead of exposing a separate *white-point* parameter;\r\n- is based on the resources below together with the “Bounded VNDF Sampling for Smith-GGX Reflections” paper.\r\n\r\nThe pre-filtering pipeline is largely based on these articles:\r\n- https://placeholderart.wordpress.com/2015/07/28/implementation-notes-runtime-environment-map-filtering-for-image-based-lighting/\r\n- https://bruop.github.io/ibl/\r\n- https://gpuopen.com/download/Bounded_VNDF_Sampling_for_Smith-GGX_Reflections.pdf\r\n\r\n> The forward-/reverse-tonemap trick removes almost all fireflies without the need for a separate white-point parameter.\r\n\r\nPrevious work: #9414\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe `reflection_probes.rs` example has been updated:\r\n\r\n- The camera starts closer to the spheres so the reflections are easier to see.\r\n- The GLTF scene is spawned only when the reflection probe mode is active (press Space).\r\n- The third display mode (toggled with Space) shows the generated cubemap chain.\r\n- You can change the roughness of the center sphere with the Up/Down keys.\r\n\r\n## Render Graph\r\n\r\nComposed of two nodes and a graph edge:\r\n```\r\nDownsampling -> Filtering\r\n```\r\n\r\nPass breakdown:\r\n```\r\ndowsampling_first_pass -> dowsampling_second_pass ->\r\nradiance_map_pass -> irradiance_map_pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1601\" height=\"2281\" alt=\"render-graph\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c240688-32f7-447a-9ede-6050b77c0bd1\" />\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n<img width=\"2564\" height=\"1500\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56e68dd7-9488-4d35-9bba-7f713a3e2831\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nUser facing API:\r\n```rust\r\ncommands.entity(camera)\r\n    .insert(GeneratedEnvironmentMapLight {\r\n        environment_map: world.load_asset(\"environment_maps/pisa_specular_rgb9e5_zstd.ktx2\"),\r\n        ..default()\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Computed Environment Maps\r\nTo use fully dynamic environment maps, create a new placeholder image handle with `Image::new_fill`, extract it to the render world. Then dispatch a compute shader, bind the image as a 2d array storage texture. Anything can be rendered to the custom dynamic environment map.\r\nThis is already demonstrated in PR #19037 with the `atmosphere.rs` example.\r\n\r\nWe can extend this idea further and run the entire PBR pipeline from the perspective of the light probe, and it is possible to have some form of global illumination or baked lighting information this way, especially if we make use of irradiance volumes for the realtime aspect. This method could very well be extended to bake indirect lighting in the scene.\r\n#13840 should make this possible!\r\n\r\n## Notes for reviewers\r\n\r\nThis PR no longer bundles any large test textures.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19076/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19076/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18800602550,"node_id":"MIE_lADODf6-U87CWzfbzwAAAARgmm22","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18800602550","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-24T18:04:16Z","milestone":{"title":"0.17"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18800605295,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U87CWzfbzwAAAARgmnhv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18800605295","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-24T18:04:28Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Triage","color":"D876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18800605314,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U87CWzfbzwAAAARgmniC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18800605314","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-24T18:04:28Z","label":{"name":"A-Rendering","color":"C6A751"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18800605327,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U87CWzfbzwAAAARgmniP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18800605327","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":
