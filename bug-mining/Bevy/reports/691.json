For example if a space ship blows up, the space ship despawns, and some broken space ship physics objects are there instead.  I realized a good workflow for how I'm making levels would be to create child objects in Blender and mark them as a \"gib\". When any scene is spawned, all gibs are hidden, then when that entity blows up, it calls remove_parent_in_place() on the gibs, and then calls despawn_recursive() on the entity itself.\n\nThen the issue arose: the gib meshes are despawned when despawn_recursive() is called, even though the gib meshes are no longer descendants.\n\nI thought maybe I just need to wait a frame or two to let the remove_parent work, but even waiting hundreds of frames, it still happens.\n\n## What went wrong\n\n- what were you expecting?\nI was expecting the gib meshes (child entities) to remain in the world after calling despawn_recursive on its prior parent.\n\n- what actually happened?\nThe gib meshes were despawned.\n\n## Additional information\n\nI made a MRE just to make sure it wasn't anything else in my project causing the issue. I attached the MRE to this issue as a zip file.\n\n[unparent.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18815776/unparent.zip)","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17883/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
