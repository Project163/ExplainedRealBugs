reported in #14004, many third-party plugins, such as Hanabi, enqueue entities that don't have meshes into render phases. However, the introduction of indirect mode added a dependency on mesh-specific data, breaking this workflow. This is because GPU preprocessing requires that the render phases manage indirect draw parameters, which don't apply to objects that aren't meshes. The existing code skips over binned entities that don't have indirect draw parameters, which causes the rendering to be skipped for such objects.\r\n\r\nTo support this workflow, this commit adds a new field, `non_mesh_items`, to `BinnedRenderPhase`.  This field contains a simple list of (bin key, entity) pairs. After drawing batchable and unbatchable objects, the non-mesh items are drawn one after another. Bevy itself doesn't enqueue any items into this list; it exists solely for the application and/or plugins to use.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this commit switches the asset ID in the standard bin keys to be an untyped asset ID rather than that of a mesh. This allows more flexibility, allowing bins to be keyed off any type of asset.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a new example, `custom_phase_item`, which simultaneously serves to demonstrate how to use this new feature and to act as a regression test so this doesn't break again.\r\n\r\nFixes #14004.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n* `BinnedRenderPhase` now contains a `non_mesh_items` field for plugins to add custom items to.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14029/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14029/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13290700048,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86NUurgzwAAAAMYL_0Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13290700048","actor":{"login":"pcwalton","id":157897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton","html_url":"https://github.com/pcwalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f0cce2bd9af48c21bde08e94d025504756f98317","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcwalton/bevy/commits/f0cce2bd9af48c21bde08e94d025504756f98317","created_at":"2024-06-26T03:30:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13300054443,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86NUurgzwAAAAMYvrmr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13300054443","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-26T14:58:33Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Review","color":"D876E3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13300054525,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86NUurgzwAAAAMYvrn9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13300054525","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-26T14:58:33Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-SME","color":"D876E3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13320252589,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86NUurgzwAAAAMZ8uyt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13320252589","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/
