Objective\r\n\r\nUse the scale factor of the render target for `Text2d` entities, instead of always using the scale factor of the primary window.\r\n\r\nFixes #17342\r\nFixes #1890\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIterate the cameras, find the first camera with `RenderLayers` intersecting the `Text2d` entity's `RenderLayers` and use that camera's target's scale factor.\r\n\r\nThis also allows us to remove the `bevy_window` dependency from `bevy_sprite_render` and make it optional for `bevy_sprite` on the \"bevy_sprite_picking_backend\" feature.\r\n\r\n`Text2d` is still limited to generating only one text layout per `Text2d` entity. If a `Text2d` entity is simultaneously rendered to multiple targets with different scale factors then the maximum of the target scale factors is used.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI think I'm using `RenderLayers` and `VisibleEntities` correctly, and my tests and the examples seem to work, but it would be best if a rendering SME gave this a glance just to to make sure that I'm not doing something naive.\r\n\r\nComes with a new example `multi_window_text` that can be used for testing:\r\n```\r\ncargo run --example multi_window_text\r\n```\r\nIf the changes are working correctly, the secondary window's text should be twice as big as the primary window's text without blurriness.\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n<img width=\"642\" alt=\"primary\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/547edf21-5c6e-4a95-ac8b-1b08b1c1364e\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"642\" alt=\"secondary\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b38d278d-64bc-4a90-9b11-0ac27d3a02bb\" />\r\n\r\nAll the text uses a font-size of `30`.  The secondary window has a scale factor of `2.`, so the secondary window's text uses glyphs drawn at double the resolution. On main, `Text2d` use glyphs drawn at the same size for both windows, and so the text drawn with `Text2d` to the secondary window is blurry:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"642\" alt=\"secondary_main\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aa3a523-e1d4-4196-a13c-d6ac8aa34cf3\" />\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20656/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19230005127,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86l7pihzwAAAAR6MpeH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19230005127","actor":{"login":"m2ym","id":52525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/m2ym","html_url":"https://github.com/m2ym","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m2ym/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m2ym/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m2ym/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m2ym/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m2ym/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m2ym/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m2ym/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m2ym/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/m2ym/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-19T18:09:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19334436872,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86l7pihzwAAAASAbBgI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19334436872","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6eb12806a9405e6f9223355cdeb0271808908678","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/6eb12806a9405e6f9223355cdeb0271808908678","created_at":"2025-08-26T03:25:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19334436992,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86l7pihzwAAAASAbBiA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19334436992","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-26T03:25:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
