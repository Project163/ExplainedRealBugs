When we want a headless app for a game, what we really want is everything *except* rendering related things, not to disable everything.\r\n\r\nFor example, basically every bevy game is going to want `TransformPlugin` and `LogPlugin`.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\nA new plugin group that is just `DefaultPlugins` minus rendering related plugins. From my own project this is what I've started with:\r\n```rust\r\nDefaultPlugins\r\n    .build()\r\n    .disable::<RenderPlugin>()\r\n    .disable::<PbrPlugin>()\r\n    .disable::<CorePipelinePlugin>()\r\n    .disable::<ImagePlugin>()\r\n    .disable::<TextPlugin>()\r\n    .disable::<SpritePlugin>()\r\n    .disable::<WindowPlugin>()\r\n    .disable::<WinitPlugin>()\r\n    .disable::<GizmoPlugin>()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\nLetting users do this themselves if it's what they want.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
