Objective\r\n\r\nLimited implementation of the CSS property `overflow-clip-margin`\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-clip-margin\r\n\r\nAllows you to control the visible area for clipped content when using overfllow-clip, -hidden, or -scroll and expand it with a margin.\r\n\r\nBased on #15442\r\n\r\nFixes #15468\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdds a new field to Style: `overflow_clip_margin: OverflowClipMargin`.\r\nThe field is ignored unless overflow-clip, -hidden or -scroll is set on at least one axis.\r\n\r\n`OverflowClipMargin` has these associated constructor functions:\r\n```\r\npub const fn content_box() -> Self;\r\npub const fn padding_box() -> Self;\r\npub const fn border_box() -> Self;\r\n```\r\nYou can also use the method `with_margin` to increases the size of the visible area:\r\n```\r\ncommands\r\n  .spawn(NodeBundle {\r\n      style: Style {\r\n          width: Val::Px(100.),\r\n          height: Val::Px(100.),\r\n          padding:

responsive margin values support. This could be added in a follow up if we want it.\r\n* CSS also supports a `margin-box` option but we don't have access to the margin values in `Node` so it's probably not feasible to implement atm.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n```cargo run --example overflow_clip_margin```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"396\" alt=\"overflow-clip-margin\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07b51cd6-a565-4451-87a0-fa079429b04b\">\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nStyle has a new field `OverflowClipMargin`.  It allows users to set the visible area for clipped content when using overflow-clip, -hidden, or -scroll and expand it with a margin.\r\n\r\nThere are three associated constructor functions `content_box`, `padding_box` and `border_box`:\r\n* `content_box`: elements painted outside of the content box area (the innermost part of the node excluding the padding and border) of the node are clipped. This is the new default behaviour.\r\n* `padding_box`: elements painted outside outside of the padding area of the node are clipped. \r\n* `border_box`:  elements painted outside of the bounds of the node are clipped. This matches the behaviour from Bevy 0.14.\r\n\r\nThere is also a `with_margin` method that increases the size of the visible area by the given number in logical pixels, negative margin values are clamped to zero.\r\n\r\n`OverflowClipMargin` is ignored unless overflow-clip, -hidden or -scroll is also set on at least one axis of the UI node.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15561/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15561/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14679016322,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86YJA9yzwAAAANq8AOC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14679016322","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6d3965f520121c3aacb13d0ea559afdff11c76ff","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/6d3965f520121c3aacb13d0ea559afdff11c76ff","created_at":"2024-10-16T13:37:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14679019643,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86YJA9yzwAAAANq8BB7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14679019643","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-16T13:37:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
