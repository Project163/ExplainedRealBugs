We should consider whether to leave this as a manual call, a plugin parameter, or a synchronized resource-based setting. I think that runtime changes to this will be extremely rare, so my preference is a plugin parameter with a documented escape hatch to change the value manually.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nWhen pipelined rendering is disabled, we should consider swapping to 1, or suggesting that users do so. The sequential-CPU-GPU pattern is what we're already doing in that case, so the lower latency might be a good choice.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThanks to @aevyrie for [mentioning this](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/743663924229963868/1228064840858337291). @JMS55 points out that we're currently defaulting to 2.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12930/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
