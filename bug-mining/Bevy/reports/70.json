However, I would like to search for possible duplicate and get a handle to the duplicate, if it exists, before doing the add.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet new_asset = MyAssetType {\r\n    data: 1,\r\n};\r\n// TODO: Do not call following code if asset is a duplicate of an existing one\r\n// set the handle to the pre-existing asset\r\nlet asset_handle = my_assets.add(new_asset);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI spent a lot of time reading the doc and trying some code. I can find duplicates with:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nmy_asserts.iter().find(|(id, a)| **a == new_asset)\r\n```\r\nBut I do not manage to get a strong handle to the existing asset.\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong? Is there way to do what I want?</div>\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12087/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
