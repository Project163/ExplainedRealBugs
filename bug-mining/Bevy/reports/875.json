The code seems to do everything correctly, but the default level filter is ignored and running any bevy app now spams the console with trace level logs.\n\nI have investigated it a little bit and something is very weird. The default_filter kinda works for some dependencies. If I change the naga filter to trace I'll get a bunch of new naga logs that don't show up with the default config, but if I try to add a new filter for naga_oil it doesn't seem to do anything. I also tried removing the default filter and using `.with_default_directive(Level::INFO.into())` which should simply default _everything_ to info but that also did nothing. I tried moving the order in which the layers are added, but again, nothing.\n\nI'm unsure what else to try and the log spam is _really_ annoying so if we don't have a fix soon we should consider reverting the PR for now.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
