That means if one needs that, they would need to implement that themselves in their code.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\nIf possible and/or wanted `delta` to be added to the `CursorMoved` event.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\nImplementing the delta calculation in my own game code or trying to solve my problem without using deltas.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nIf this is nothing against this addition, i'd like to try implementing this myself. I haven't gone into the bevy internals so idk how possible this is, but i'd like to try :)  \r\n\r\nFor additionaly context why i want this change: Added is a video of my WIP app, where i'm trying to implement a mouse-dragging camera controller. At the moment i'm using the deltas from `MouseMotion`, which causes issues since apparently on my laptop there's some kind of mouse acceleration or something.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/28149337/1e03e87d-36ae-46e6-be03-3127159afea1\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"james7132","id":3137680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzc2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132","html_url":"https://github.com/james7132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11695/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
