The CI then pulled the latest version of `bevy` from github.\n\n## What went wrong\n\nHappened on a compilation error, where `bevy_error_panic_hook` errors because it is trying to reference a `static` that does not exist.\n\n## Additional information\n\nIt appears that the [hook](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blame/main/crates/bevy_ecs/src/error/bevy_error.rs#L139) is incorrectly feature flagged, and needs *both* `std` AND `backtrace` to be enabled. I'd suggest that the `backtrace` feature requires `std` feature and to have the hook feature flagged behind `backtrace` instead of `std`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
