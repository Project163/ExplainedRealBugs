a Grey trait to allow colors to create a generic \"grey\" color.\r\n\r\nThis currently assumes the color spaces follow the same gradient, which I'm pretty sure isn't true, but it should make a \"grey-ish\" color relative to the provided intensity.\r\n\r\n# Objective\r\n\r\n- Implements #13206 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- A small `Grey` trait was added and implemented for the common color kinds.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Currently untested, unit tests exposed the non-linear relation between colors. I am debating adding an example to show this, as I have no idea what color space represents what relation of grey, and I figure others may be similarly confused.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- The `Grey` trait was added, and the corresponding `grey` \r\n\r\n## BREAKING CHANGES\r\n\r\nThe const qualifier for LinearRGBA::gray was removed (the symbol still exists via a trait, it's just not const anymore)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2094370804","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13206#issuecomment-2094370804","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13206","id":2094370804,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U8581Y_0","user":{"login":"Earthmark","id":1251609,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTE2MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1251609?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earthmark","html_url":"https://github.com/Earthmark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earthmark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earthmark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earthmark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earthmark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earthmark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earthmark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earthmark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earthmark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earthmark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-04T20:28:10Z","updated_at":"2024-05-08T03:21:27Z","body":"This came up when drafting the PR, but is the goal with this interface to have a specific input value (say `grey(0.5)`), to mean the same color in every color format?\r\n\r\n~~I implemented a linear traversal of the color values, not so much the color space.
