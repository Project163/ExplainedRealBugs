Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #14511.\r\n\r\n`despawn` allows you to remove entities from the world. However, if the entity does not exist, it emits a warning. This may not be intended behavior for many users who have use cases where they need to call `despawn` regardless of if the entity actually exists (see the issue), or don't care in general if the entity already doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n(Also trying to gauge interest on if this feature makes sense, I'd personally love to have it, but I could see arguments that this might be a footgun. Just trying to help here 😄 If there's no contention I could also implement this for `despawn_recursive` and `despawn_descendants` in the same PR)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdd `try_despawn`, `try_despawn_recursive` and `try_despawn_descendants`.\r\n\r\nModify `World::despawn_with_caller` to also take in a `warn` boolean argument, which is then considered when logging the warning. Set `log_warning` to `true` in the case of `despawn`, and `false` in the case of `try_despawn`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nRan `cargo run -p ci` on macOS, it seemed fine.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14507312878,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86RFY7fzwAAAANgtAbu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14507312878","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2da8d17a4434246a83686f42ba2b85c5745865a5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/2da8d17a4434246a83686f42ba2b85c5745865a5","created_at":"2024-10-03T16:38:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14507313063,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86RFY7fzwAAAANgtAen","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14507313063","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-03T16:38:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14512639321,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86RFY7fzwAAAANhBU1Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14512639321","actor":{"login":"ItsDoot","id":9044780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDQ3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9044780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot","html_url":"https://github.com/ItsDoot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4cdf6e226e6119616388f25a08172521e926a1a9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ItsDoot/bevy/commits/4cdf6e226e6119616388f25a08172521e926a1a9","created_at":"2024-10-04T03:22:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14516460435,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86RFY7fzwAAAANhP5uT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14516460435","actor":{"login":"robtfm","id":50659922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjU5OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50659922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm","html_url":"https://github.com/robtfm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robtfm/followers","following_url":"https://a
