This seems to be have added to support component hook lifecycles with #10756, not because it is a general behavior of exclusive systems.~~\n**EDIT**: correction, `World::flush` does not apply the schedule's commands, only the global ones.\n\nI looked at a field [`no_sync_edges`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3c9e696faa961ac01cec5933dcb4d16e653a5ecf/crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/auto_insert_apply_deferred.rs#L25) that contains edges where sync points should be automatically inserted. (in contrast to actively adding it via `ApplyDeferred` I guess) That does not seem to care for exclusiveness of system nodes if you scroll through the file.\n\nSo I checked where `System::is_exclusive` matters.\n\nBesides checking for conflicting access, it matters for when [`spawn_exclusive_system_task`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3c9e696faa961ac01cec5933dcb4d16e653a5ecf/crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/executor/multi_threaded.rs#L440) is run. But that only applies commands if the system is `ApplyDeferred`, which my `assert_system` is not. I also don't think that is where that behavior belongs as sync points should be independent of single/multi threading. Unless a fix is added to all executors.\n\nCurrently I run out of ideas where to look for this \"commands are always applied before exclusive systems\". I mean this issue shows that it is not really working. \n\nI suspect my system `third` here is no hint where the bug is at but only adds it's own sync point. Though it is weird it is not added after `assert_system` in half the cases. Maybe because `ExclusiveSystemFunction::has_deferred` returns `false` so the scheduler does not think it matters where it adds the sync point.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2660933545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"urben1680","id":55257931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjU3OTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55257931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680","html_url":"https://github.com/urben1680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2661047003","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17828#issuecomment-2661047003","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17828","id":2661047003,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86enFrb","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-15T18:58:45Z","updated_at":"2025-02-15T18:58:45Z","body":"> Currently I run out of ideas where to look for this \"commands are always applied before exclusive systems\".

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #17828\r\n\r\nExclusive systems are expected to see the effects of all precedent commands. This was previously not made sure of by the scheduler. This showed especially with `*_ignore_deferred` configurations.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nEvery edge that leads to an exclusive system will contain a sync point that are combined into one if needed.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be no extra sync point after the exclusive system because it can only queue commands in the global commands queue and that is flushed already in the [`ExclusiveFunctionSystem::run`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3c9e696faa961ac01cec5933dcb4d16e653a5ecf/crates/bevy_ecs/src/system/exclusive_function_system.rs#L131) implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nSee the new unit tests. \r\nI did not add mirrored tests of those in the `no_sync_edges` and `no_sync_chain` modules below the new test because I think these are enough. Though I can add more if desired.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this needs any. The API did not change and I can think up no scenario where someone would rely on absent sync points before exclusive systems.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17874/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2661404120","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17828#issuecomment-2661404120","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17828","id":2661404120,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86eoc3Y","user":{"login":"urben1680","id":55257931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjU3OTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55257931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680","html_url":"https://github.com/urben1680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-16T12:14:02Z","updated_at":"2025-02-16T13:29:51Z","body":"I

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #17828\r\n\r\nThis fixes two bugs:\r\n\r\n1. Exclusive systems should see the effect of all commands queued to that point. That does not happen when the system is configured with `*_ignore_deferred` which may lead to surprising situations. These configurations should not behave like that.\r\n2. If `*_ignore_deferred` is used, no sync point may be added at all **after** the config. Currently this can happen if the last nodes in that config have no deferred parameters themselves. Instead, sync points should always be added after such a config, so long systems have deferred parameters.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n1. When adding sync points on edges, do not consider `AutoInsertApplyDeferredPass::no_sync_edges` if the target is an exclusive system.\r\n2. when going through the nodes in a directed way, store the information that `AutoInsertApplyDeferredPass::no_sync_edges` suppressed adding a sync point at the target node. Then, when the target node is evaluated later by the iteration and that prior suppression was the case, the target node will behave like it has deferred parameters even if the system itself does not.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI added a test for each bug, please let me know if more are wanted and if yes, which cases you would want to see.\r\nThese tests also can be read as examples how the current code would fail.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17880/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16486721974,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86p1M9SzwAAAAPWr2m2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16486721974","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2f384643c3cde3fb677828b836dc9e965be4ebed","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/2f384643c3cde3fb677828b836dc9e965be4ebed","created_at":"2025-02-26T20:56:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16486722114,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86p1M9SzwAAAAPWr2pC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16486722114","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-26T20:56:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
