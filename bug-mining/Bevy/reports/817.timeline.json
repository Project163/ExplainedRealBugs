Hopefully this is helpful :)\n\n\nedit: realized that the problem has to do with material_bindings_index not getting updated (since the assumption was that it will be set later. by looking into the value of the `material_bindings_index` here, all the values appear to not have differentiated from the default value.\n\nThe reason this doesn't get updated is because WebGL2, at least for me, falls back to CPU processing (seen as a warning in the console), so this value isn't filled.\n\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/5f936aefc800f6ba55e45168a07595fda0a3c921/crates/bevy_pbr/src/render/mesh.rs#L1910\n\nI've not figured out how to actually resolve this
