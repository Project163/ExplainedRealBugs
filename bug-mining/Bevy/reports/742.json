We'd expect the parent to still have the Children component from the initial hook.\n\n## What went wrong\n\nThe parent is missing the Children component since the on_replace hook ran!\n\n#17858 made it so that relationship hooks do not run when spawning scenes. However, it did not prevent on_replace hooks. This can result in a relationship being removed, but the corresponding relationship not being inserted back.\n\nThis only applies when the entity already has the component being inserted. In many cases this is not a problem - for entity cloning, the entity doesn't have any relationships, so nothing breaks. For spawning scenes from scratch, it is also not a problem. However for scene hot-reloading, this is a problem.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18357/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
