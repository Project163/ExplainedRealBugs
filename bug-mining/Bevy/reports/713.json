I initialize the `AssetPlugin` like this:\n```rust\napp.add_plugins(AssetPlugin {\n    file_path: \"../assets\".to_string(),\n    ..default()\n});\n```\n\nThen while the app is running, I altered an image in the asset directory.\n## What went wrong\n\nWhenever an asset updates, a panic occurs: (edited)\n```\nthread 'notify-rs debouncer loop' panicked at <home-folder>/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/bevy_asset-0.15.2/src/io/file/file_watcher.rs:51:9:\nFileWatcher::get_asset_path() failed to strip prefix from absolute path: absolute_path=\"<path-to-workspace>/my-app/../assets/gui/buttons.png\", root=\"<path-to-workspace>/assets\"\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\n```\nIn a project with a different folder layout, the asset updates instead.\n\n## Additional information\n\nI cloned bevy and changed the `FileEventHandler::get_path` function to this:\n```\n    fn get_path(&self, absolute_path: &Path) -> Option<(PathBuf, bool)> {\n        let absolute_path = absolute_path.canonicalize().unwrap();\n        Some(get_asset_path(&self.root, &absolute_path))\n    }\n```\nThis is on line 264 of `bevy_assets/src/io/file/file_watcher.rs`. This fixed the issue\n\nI also tested several of bevy's examples with the file_watcher feature and it worked as expected in all cases, so I believe this change is a complete solution to the issue.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18022/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
