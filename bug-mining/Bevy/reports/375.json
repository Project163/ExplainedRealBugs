Bevy version\r\n\r\n- Issue occurs on current git main (ffe0f7f)\r\n- Git bisect identifies `d9527c101c2f49c6884763cce36ea1d27dd6a597` (#14833) as the first bad commit\r\n- Issue **does not** occur on crates.io v0.14.1\r\n\r\n## \\[Optional\\] Relevant system information\r\n\r\n- `cargo 1.80.1 (376290515 2024-07-16)`\r\n- `Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS`\r\n- `AdapterInfo { name: \"AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT (RADV

Cargo.toml:\r\n```toml\r\n[package]\r\nname = \"testy\"\r\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\r\nedition = \"2021\"\r\n\r\n[dependencies]\r\nbevy = { git = \"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy\", branch = \"main\", default-features = false, features = [\r\n\t\"x11\",\r\n\t\"bevy_core_pipeline\",\r\n] }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- main.rs:\r\n```rust\r\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\r\n\r\nfn main() -> AppExit {\r\n    App::new()\r\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\r\n        .add_systems(Startup, |world: &mut World| {\r\n            world.spawn(Camera3dBundle::default()); // Camera2dBundle also works\r\n

wrong\r\n\r\n![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b487fd34-0a17-43b0-998c-7838c1213e6d)\r\n\r\n![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b5657ad-226a-43e0-8a30-da951ddadcca)\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nChanging the above Cargo.toml to the following fixes the issue:\r\n```diff\r\n[package]\r\nname = \"testy\"\r\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\r\nedition = \"2021\"\r\n\r\n[dependencies]\r\nbevy = { git = \"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy\", branch = \"main\", default-features = false, features = [\r\n\t\"x11\",\r\n\t\"bevy_core_pipeline\",\r\n+\t\"multi_threaded\",\r\n] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, all other features seem to have no effect on it. You can manually re-enable all of the default features except `multi_threaded`, and the issue still occurs. Then enable `multi_threaded`, and it's fixed.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14993/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
