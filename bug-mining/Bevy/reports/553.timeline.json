think the biggest issue to resolve for 0.15 is \"spans with valid fonts nested under empty Text not rendering by default if there is no default font\".\n\nA fix that feels reasonable for that would be to skip empty spans / not fail out for \"not yet loaded\" fonts when text is empty.

However this would result in unnecessary re-layouts + pop in. Idk if thats

Bevy version\n\n`main` (0.16.0-dev)\n\n## What you did\n\n```rs\ncommands.spawn((\n    Text::new(\"Hello, \"),\n    TextFont::from_font(font_a),\n)).with_child(\n    TextSpan::new(\"World!\"),\n    TextFont::from_font(font_b),\n)).with_child(TextSpan::new(\" :)\"));\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\nWhen one of `font_a` or `font_b` is not a valid handle to a font (e.g. if the asset is still loading, or if `Handle::default()` is used while bevy's default font feature is disabled), the entire text will be invisible with no warning emitted. It can be difficult to trace down why the text isn't rendering, because it looks like the issue is \"higher up\" than it actually is, and you'd need good tooling for inspecting entities and font handles.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Log a warning like \"text span {id} is using an invalid font handle {handle}, so the entire text cannot be rendered\".\n2. Render the rest of the text, skipping only the invalid spans.\n3. Render the rest of the text, replacing invalid spans with � or similar.\n4. Suggestion (2) or (3) but also log a warning.\n\nPersonal preference towards 2 or 4, but 1 is good enough.\n\n## Additional information\n\nA similar issue can happen when setting a font size of `f32::NAN`, but the effects of doing so are inconsistent.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18205/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
