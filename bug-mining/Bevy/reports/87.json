I think this is important because in ECS, until now, there is no perceptual difference for the user between mutating a component or just replacing it. Now there is and users should be aware of that.\r\n```rust\r\n/// Will trigger on_insert hook\r\nfn update_health(\r\n    mut evts: EventReader<Damage>, q: Query<&Health, With<Player>>, mut commands: Commands,\r\n) {\r\n    for &Damage(entity, hit) in evts.read() {\r\n        if let Ok(Health(current)) = q.get(entity) {\r\n            let new_health = (current - hit).min(0.0);\r\n            commands.entity(entity).insert(Health(new_health));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n/// Won't trigger on_insert hook\r\nfn update_health_mut(mut evts: EventReader<Damage>, mut q: Query<&mut Health, With<Player>>) {\r\n    for &Damage(entity, hit) in evts.read() {\r\n        if let Ok(mut current) = q.get_mut(entity) {\r\n            let new_health = (current.0 - hit).min(0.0);\r\n            current.0 = new_health;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. `component_hooks.rs` example should avoid using \"advanced\" terms without an easy explanation for the user, like:\r\n```\r\n    // In order to register component hooks the component must:\r\n    // - not belong to any created archetypes\r\n    // - not already have a hook of that kind registered\r\n```\r\nIn this case I think we should \"translate\" what `not belogin to any created archtypes` means, like \"Can't be already inserted to any entity\" or something like that.\r\n\r\n4. `component_hooks.rs` example should (maybe?) tell users that `Events` should be prefered whenever applicable, since hooks can be more performance intensive or at least, more limited (I'm not sure about this one, tho)\r\n\r\nIf that make sense, I can make a PR for that.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12256/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
