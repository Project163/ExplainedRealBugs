What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nShortName was moved into `bevy_reflect` because it seemed logical, but there is one place where it created a \"regression\" of sorts. `bevy_render` is an optional dependency of `bevy_ecs`, and it didn't used to be necessary for the error reporting functionality of `ScheduleGraph`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\n[`ShortName` should be its own crate external to bevy because it solves a problem that is not specific to bevy.](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15340#issuecomment-2365336636)\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nHaving it be its own crate within bevy would be possible, but
