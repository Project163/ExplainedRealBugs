Objective\r\n\r\nfix #14742\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nthe issue arises because \"finished\" animations (where current time >= last keyframe time) are not applied at all.\r\nwhen transitioning from a finished animation to another later-indexed anim, the transition kind-of works because the finished anim is skipped, then the new anim is applied with a lower weight (weight / total_weight)\r\nwhen transitioning from a finished animation to another earlier-indexed anim, the transition is instant as the new anim is applied with 1.0 (as weight == total_weight for the first applied), then the finished animation is skipped.\r\n\r\nto fix this we can always apply every animation based on the nearest 2 keyframes, and clamp the interpolation between them to [0,1]. \r\n\r\npros:\r\n- finished animations can be transitioned out of correctly\r\n- blended animations where some curves have a last-keyframe before the end of the animation will blend properly\r\n- animations will actually finish on their last keyframe, rather than a fraction of a render-frame before the end\r\n\r\ncons:\r\n- we have to re-apply finished animations every frame whether it's necessary or not. i can't see a way to avoid
