Turns out that `HttpWasmAssetReader::fetch_bytes` from `bevy_asset` assumes at [wasm.rs#41](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/release-0.13.0/crates/bevy_asset/src/io/wasm.rs#L41) that it is running in a window and not in a worker.\r\n\r\nNote that gloo-net used to have a similar issue but resolved the issue by probing the global object to see whether it was a `web_sys::Window` or a `web_sys::WorkerGlobalScope` in [request.rs#323](https://github.com/rustwasm/gloo/blob/0.9.0/crates/net/src/http/request.rs#L323-L338).\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\nThis issue could be resolved by either adding a dependency on gloo-net or duplicating its logic into bevy_asset. For the latter approach, it might also be an idea to then add an option field to the `HttpWasmAssetReader` that contains the probed global object type once it has been \"resolved\".\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12125/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
