Objective\r\n\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17267, we'd like to unify input-focus driven widget activations (e.g. press enter to click the focused button) with mouse-driven picking interactions by going through the bevy_picking infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWhile you *can* fake this with observer triggers, it is:\r\n\r\n- inaccurate: you're feeding in garbage information\r\n- extremely verbose\r\n- rather arcane\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAs @aevyrie points out, we have access to everything we need to send realistic pointer events! Doing this *correctly* requires rather a lot of information. To make users lives easier, I've introduced a system param with all of the required information, which simulates pointer events at the center of the UI node specified.\r\n\r\nThe `directional_navigation` example has been updated to demonstrate / test this change.\r\n\r\nI've also removed the `Component` impl for `bevy_picking::Location` as this is unused and a serious footgun: I wasted quite a bit of time trying to debug what had gone wrong. See #17390.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\n- Some small improvements to this general area of the code have been split out into #17395. They'd be nice here, but I wanted to reduce complexity here.\r\n- While PointerId::Custom exists, it is challenging to both generate a UUID and to match against it if you want to respond differently if the Pointer event is from a focused element. While I could have used sentinel values here, I think it's more idiomatic and nicer to use if we just add an enum arm for a common use.\r\n- We should probably rename `bevy_ui/picking_backend.rs`, but I've opted to defer that to make the diff easier to read.\r\n- This was originally a custom command, but has been refactored to a `SystemParam` for flexibility, easier error handling and performance.\r\n- As follow-up, we could add some simple helper methods to the `SystemParam` to make certain actions even easier.\r\n- In theory, other backends could do the same thing! The logic required is slightly specialized, so I stuck to just UI for now.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI've tested this with the `directional_navigation` example. While I hope that this works properly with more exotic windowing / rendering target setups (viewports, portals, multiple windows), we're not equipped to do that effectively right now.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n`bevy_picking::Location` is no longer a component. This was a bug: you wanted `PickingLocation`.\r\n\r\n`PointerId` has a new variant, `PointerId::Focus` that will need to be exhaustively matched against.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17399/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-08T16:44:51Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T16:44:51Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/issues/255","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/issues/255/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/issues/255/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/issues/255/events","html_url":"https://github.com/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/issues/255","id":2840104066,"node_id":"I_kwDOHQrusc6pSIyC","number":255,"title":"Missing
