Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #17642\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Implemented method `new_bezier(points: [P; 4]) -> Self` for `CubicSegment<P>`\r\n- Old implementation of `new_bezier` is now `new_bezier_easing(p1: impl Into<Vec2>, p2: impl Into<Vec2>) -> Self` (**breaking change**)\r\n- ~~added method `new_bezier_with_anchor`, which can make a bezier curve between two points with one control anchor~~\r\n- added methods `iter_positions`, `iter_velocities`, `iter_accelerations`, the same as in `CubicCurve` (**copied code, potentially can be reduced)**\r\n- bezier creation logic is moved from `CubicCurve` to `CubicSegment`, removing the unneeded allocation\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Did you test these changes? If so, how?\r\n  - Run tests inside `crates/bevy_math/`\r\n  - Tested the functionality in my project\r\n- Are there any parts that need more testing?\r\n  - Did not run `cargo test` on the whole bevy directory because of OOM\r\n  - Performance improvements are expected when creating `CubicCurve` with `new_bezier` and `new_bezier_easing`, but not tested\r\n- How can other people (reviewers) test your changes? Is there anything specific they need to know?\r\n  - Use in any code that works created `CubicCurve::new_bezier`\r\n- If relevant, what platforms did you test these changes on, and are there any important ones you can't test?\r\n  - I don't think relevant\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Imagine a car goes towards a local target\r\n\r\n// Create a simple `CubicSegment`, without using heap\r\nlet planned_path = CubicSegment::new_bezier([\r\n    car_pos,\r\n    car_pos + car_dir * turn_radius,\r\n    target_point - target_dir * turn_radius,\r\n    target_point,\r\n]);\r\n\r\n// Check if the planned path itersect other entities\r\nfor pos in planned_path.iter_positions(8) {\r\n   // do some collision checks\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n> This section is optional.
