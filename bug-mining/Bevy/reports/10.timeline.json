Objective\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a robust retry mechanism for retrying assets that fail to load, which is extremely useful if you have assets coming in over a network. It's configured for the WASM asset reader by default, but can easily support third-party asset readers (like [bevy_web_asset](https://github.com/johanhelsing/bevy_web_asset)).\r\n\r\n* Built atop #11369\r\n* Fixes #17378\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\nThe `AssetLoadRetryPlugin` is added to the `DefaultPlugins`, so it will work out-of-the box. To get retries to happen, you must use an `AssetReader` that provides `get_retry_settings` (like `HttpWasmAssetReader`), or provide your own source or asset-specific settings via the `AssetLoadRetrier` resource.\r\n\r\n## Customization Examples\r\n\r\n### Retry Settings By Source\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut retrier = app.world.resource_mut::<AssetLoadRetrier>();\r\nretrier.set_source_settings(\r\n    AssetSourceId::Default,\r\n    IoErrorRetrySettingsProvider::from(AssetLoadRetrySettings {\r\n        max_attempts: 5,\r\n        max_delay: Duration::from_millis(5000),\r\n        starting_delay: Duration::from_millis(100),\r\n        time_multiple: 2.0,\r\n    }),\r\n);\r\n```\r\n### Retry Settings By Asset Type\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut retrier = app.world.resource_mut::<AssetLoadRetrier>();\r\n// Retry images with their own interval\r\nretrier.set_asset_settings::<Image>(IoErrorRetrySettingsProvider::from(AssetLoadRetrySettings {\r\n    max_attempts: 1,\r\n    max_delay: Duration::from_millis(1000),\r\n    starting_delay: Duration::from_millis(1000),\r\n    time_multiple: 1.0,\r\n}));\r\n\r\n// Disable all retries for CoolText\r\nretrier.set_asset_settings::<CoolText>(AssetLoadRetrySettings::no_retries());\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Disable Retries for Certain Domains\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut retrier = app.world.resource_mut::<AssetLoadRetrier>();\r\n\r\n#[derive(Default)]\r\nstruct CustomRetrySettingsProvider(IoErrorRetrySettingsProvider);\r\n\r\nimpl ProvideAssetLoadRetrySettings for CustomRetrySettingsProvider {\r\n    fn get_settings(\r\n        &self,\r\n        default_settings: AssetLoadRetrySettings,\r\n        event: &UntypedAssetLoadFailedEvent,\r\n    ) -> AssetLoadRetrySettings {\r\n        // Ignore defaults from the source and let IoErrorRetrySettingsProvider\r\n        // provide its preferred settings, given the error.\r\n        let settings = self.0.get_retry_settings(default_settings, event);\r\n\r\n        // Block any retries for bevyengine.org\r\n        if settings.will_retry() {\r\n            if event\r\n                .path\r\n                .to_string()\r\n                .to_lowercase()\r\n                .starts_with(\"https://bevyengine.org/\")\r\n            {\r\n                return AssetLoadRetrySettings::no_retries();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        settings\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nretrier.set_source_settings(\r\n\tAssetSourceId::Name(\"https\".into()),\r\n\tCustomRetrySettingsProvider::default(),\r\n);\r\n```\r\n## Other Thoughts\r\n* I had built out a typed version of `AssetLoadRetryPlugin<A>` originally, but found the ergonomics to be... not good. Also had a few other drawbacks:\r\n\t* It felt confusing to have retry state spread out across asset types, when retry behavior is almost always source-specific.\r\n\t* Enabling it for all existing and future Asset types was near-impossible.\r\n\t* Supporting a global retry rate limit in the future (without introducing parallelism issues) would be difficult.\r\n* Probably outside this PR, but happy to address if desired:  `AssetReaderError::NotFound` should probably be reconsidered/removed (?). It's convenient for `AssetReaderError` match expressions and easy to construct, but it overlaps:\r\n\t* `AssetReaderError::Io(err) => { err.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound }`\r\n\t* `AssetReaderError::Http(404)`\r\n\t* We could drop `NotFound` and introduce `is_not_found(&self) -> bool` on the enum. Also `fn io_not_found() -> Self` to maintain easy construction perhaps, but that's kinda funky.\r\n* Retry jitter should be supported sometime.\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n* Added `AssetLoadRetryPlugin` which provides a robust retry mechanism for retrying assets that fail to load, which is extremely useful if you have assets coming in over a network.

Objective\r\n\r\nThis adds events for assets that fail to load along with minor utility methods to make them useful. This paves the way for users writing their own error handling and retry systems, plus Bevy including robust retry handling: #11349.\r\n\r\n* Addresses #11288\r\n* Needed for #11349\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n/// An event emitted when a specific [`Asset`] fails to load.\r\n#[derive(Event, Clone, Debug)]\r\npub struct AssetLoadFailedEvent<A: Asset> {\r\n    pub id: AssetId<A>,\r\n    /// The original handle returned when the asset load was requested.\r\n    pub handle: Option<Handle<A>>,\r\n    /// The asset path that was attempted.\r\n    pub path: AssetPath<'static>,\r\n    /// Why the asset failed to load.\r\n    pub error: AssetLoadError,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI started implementing `AssetEvent::Failed` like suggested in #11288, but decided it was better as its own type because:\r\n\r\n * I think it makes sense for `AssetEvent` to only refer to assets that actually exist. \r\n * In order to return `AssetLoadError` in the event (which is useful information for error handlers that might attempt a retry) we would have to remove `Copy` from `AssetEvent`.\r\n * There are numerous places in the render app that match against `AssetEvent`, and I don't think it's worth introducing extra noise about assets that don't exist.\r\n\r\nI also introduced `UntypedAssetLoadErrorEvent`, which is very useful in places that need to support type flexibility, like an Asset-agnostic retry plugin.\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n* **Added:** `AssetLoadFailedEvent<A>`\r\n* **Added**: `UntypedAssetLoadFailedEvent`\r\n* **Added:** `AssetReaderError::Http` for status code information on HTTP errors. Before this, status codes were only available by parsing the error message of generic `Io` errors.\r\n* **Added:** `asset_server.get_path_id(path)`. This method simply gets the asset id for the path. Without this, one was left using `get_path_handle(path)`, which has the overhead of returning a strong handle. \r\n* **Fixed**: Made `AssetServer` loads return the same handle for assets that already exist in a failed state. Now, when you attempt a `load` that's in a `LoadState::Failed` state, it'll re-use the original asset id. The advantage of this is that any dependent assets created using the original handle will \"unbreak\" if a retry succeeds.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11369/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11516655706,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U857rV6XzwAAAAKucjha","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11516655706","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c9e1fcdb355b049fa3c3df8cb1cd1f4343f1b9d1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/c9e1fcdb355b049fa3c3df8cb1cd1f4343f1b9d1","created_at":"2024-01-17T21:27:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11612903137,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U857rV6XzwAAAAK0Ltbh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11612903137","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-26T20:18:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
