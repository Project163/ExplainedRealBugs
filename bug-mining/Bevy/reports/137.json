I spoke with @cart and @mockersf about this, and we agree that it makes more sense in `bevy_app` because:\r\n\r\n1. Less administrative overhead to release the crate.\r\n2. Less cognitive overhead for users and maintainers.\r\n\r\nIf and when this code becomes more significant, we can split it back out again.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nMove the code into a new module in `bevy_app`. Add the required optional dependencies. Get CI to pass.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThis was discussed in #12557, but I didn't feel strongly enough to block forward progress: either solution was clearly better than `bevy_log`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
