this helps? I can think of some possible solutions:\n\n## Restructure the ```struct State<S: States>(pub(crate) S)``` Resource as\n```rust\nstruct State<S: States> {\n   pub(crate) state: S,\n   scoped_entities_initiated: bool,\n}\n```\nand we add the following check to the ```enable_state_scoped_entities``` method in the ``impl AppExtStates for SubApp`` block \n```rust\nif let Some(state) = self.world().get_resource::<State<S>>()\n    && state.scoped_entities_initiated\n{\n    warn!(\"some warning\");\n    return self; // don't reinitiate state scoped entities\n};\n```\n### Reservations\nThis should work, but each use case of ```State<S>``` would need to be refactored since it is no longer a tuple struct. Since S is private, this should only effect engine code. It also introduces a field to ```State<S>``` whose purpose is somewhat esoteric. \n\n## Handle the Errors\nEntities are actually despawned in ```despawn_entities_on_exit_state<S: States>``` and ```despawn_entities_on_enter_state<S: States>```. We currently use ```commands.entity(entity).despawn();``` but we could change this to ```queue_handled``` to handle the errors. This does not address the root problem though.\n\n## Make a Plugin\nWe could refactor the ```enable_state_scoped_entities``` method as a ```Plugin```. Since we have already have ```fn is_unique(&self) -> bool``` in the ```Plugin``` trait, it is trivial to ensure we do not enable scoped entities multiple times. This also has the benefit of not requiring changes to the ```State<S>``` struct. The main downside here is I don't believe bevy currently has the convention of having very small plugins (Such a plugin could be hard to find, but since state scoped entities are automatically enabled now, this is likely less of an issue).\n\n## Just remove the ```enable_state_scoped_entities``` method\nThis is done automatically now, so perhaps there is no need, given the complications it causes?\n\n##\nHopefully there is something better than the propositions above?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3255269235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Glory2Antares","id":143124732,"node_id":"U_kgDOCIfo_A","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143124732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glory2Antares","html_url":"https://github.com/Glory2Antares","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glory2Antares/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glory2Antares/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glory2Antares/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glory2Antares/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glory2Antares/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glory2Antares/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glory2Antares/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glory2Antares/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glory2Antares/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3255311812","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20866#issuecomment-3255311812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20866","id":3255311812,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U87CCB3E","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-04T19:33:55Z","updated_at":"2025-09-04T19:33:55Z","body":"> Just remove the enable_state_scoped_entities method\n\nThis was my plan!

Objective\r\n\r\n- address #20866\r\n- The simplest solution to the issue above is likely to simply remove the opt-out option for state-scoped entities\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Given the popularity and low overhead of state-scoped entities, and the added complexity of allowing them to be disabled, it makes sense for state-scoped functionality to always be added when installing a State using the ```AppExtStates``` trait.\r\n- Since state-scope entities are always enabled, the ```enable_state_scoped_entities``` method from ```AppExtStates``` was removed. This should fix the linked issue above.\r\n- ```const SCOPED_ENTITIES_ENABLED: bool``` is no longer used, and was thus removed from ```States```. This had the positive consequence of simplifying the State derive macros.\r\n\r\n## Addendum\r\n\r\n- Given #19354, this is the next logical step. \r\n- Additionally, this impl block is in computed_states.rs:\r\n```rust\r\nimpl<S: ComputedStates> States for S {\r\n    const DEPENDENCY_DEPTH: usize = S::SourceStates::SET_DEPENDENCY_DEPTH + 1;\r\n\r\n    const SCOPED_ENTITIES_ENABLED: bool = true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo users cannot disable state-scoped entities for some States already!\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, this is likely a controversial PR, so feedback would be appreciated.
