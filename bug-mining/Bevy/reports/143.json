We should have an example that clearly demonstrates best practices.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n1. Plays a different sound track when the app state changes.\r\n2. Loops the sound track.\r\n3. Volume can be configured.\r\n\r\nStretch goals:\r\n\r\n1. Fade in and out during transitions.\r\n2. Don't load the audio track in all at once: instead, stream it from disk on an as-needed basis.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nBloating the repository with binary assets is a non-goal, so we should aim to have two small file-size tracks. This *must* be permissively licensed: update the CREDITS.md file.\r\n\r\nWithin those constraints, we should pick something that sounds half-decent: we want to make sure that any problems with the sound quality are Bevy problems, not the result of a terrible track.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12651/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
