Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #13711 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIntroduce `StateRegistry`, similar to `EventRegistry`, which manages state-related system execution\r\nas opposed to the current `StateTransitions` schedule.\r\nThe registry holds a linearized DAG of state dependencies.\r\nThe `update` method applies all transitions and then runs the schedules in 3 waves:\r\n- exits - From leaf to root\r\n- transitions - Arbitrary (implemented as from root to leaf)\r\n- enters - From root to leaf\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n- Manual state transition triggered through a `StateRegistry::update` rather than running a schedule.\r\n- Cleaner ordering, without a lot of `after` conditions.\r\n- Much simplified custom schedule execution.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n- Potential performance drop.\r\n  While schedule execution is world-exclusive, updates could run in parallel.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- A single test proves the order is correct.\r\n- Before finalization, this needs benchmarking.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13757/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"MiniaczQ","id":13040204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQwMjA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13040204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ","html_url":"https://github.com/MiniaczQ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MiniaczQ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-09T00:47:29Z","updated_at":"2024-06-09T00:47:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13763","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13763/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13763/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13763/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/13763","id":2341952384,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U85x4EEA","number":13763,"title":"Add

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #13711 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIntroduce smaller, generic system sets for each schedule variant, which are ordered against other generic variants:\r\n- `ExitSchedules<S>` - For `OnExit` schedules, runs from leaf states to root states.\r\n- `TransitionSchedules<S>` - For `OnTransition` schedules, runs in arbitrary order.\r\n- `EnterSchedules<S>` - For `OnEnter` schedules, runs from root states to leaf states.\r\n\r\nAlso unified `ApplyStateTransition<S>` schedule which works in basically the same way, just for internals.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- One test that tests schedule execution order\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13763/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13101679887,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86LXJltzwAAAAMM68UP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13101679887","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6d0b7504a25c6d38c2230d7f312b768f3a39eb39","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/6d0b7504a25c6d38c2230d7f312b768f3a39eb39","created_at":"2024-06-10T13:33:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13101680161,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86LXJltzwAAAAMM68Yh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13101680161","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-10T13:33:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13101858347,"node_id":"UE_lADODf6-U86LXJltzwAAAAMM7n4r","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13101858347","actor":{"login":"Retrodad0001","id":9283221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODMyMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9283221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Retrodad0001","html_url":"https://github.com/Retrodad0001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Retrodad0001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Retrodad0001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Retrodad0001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Retrodad0001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Retrodad0001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Retrodad0001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Retrodad0001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Retrodad0001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Retrodad0001/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unsubscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-10T13:45:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13105243243,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86LXJltzwAAAAMNIiRr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13105243243","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_
