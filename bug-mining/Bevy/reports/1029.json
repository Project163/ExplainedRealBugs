Type `commands.entity(ent).`, wait for the autocomplete to pop up, and pick the method that looks like what I want. `clear_children`, bingo.\n\n```rust\ncommands.entity(ent).clear_children();\n```\n\nOf course, this led to some bizarre issues where my sprites remained on screen after I had despawned them. Huh? Is bevy broken?\n\nNope, it turns out there is another method called `despawn_children` that does what I want.\n\n```rust\ncommands.entity(ent).despawn_children();\n```\n\nThe documentation for `clear_children` states: \"Removes all the children from this entity. See also `clear_related`\" It isn't clear that the child entities will NOT be despawned, but will be deparented instead.\n\nThe documentation should state that `clear_children` will not despawn the children, and that devs may want to use `despawn_children` instead.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21329/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
