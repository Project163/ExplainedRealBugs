Bevy version\n\n0.15\n\n## What you did\n\n1. I rendered a bird into RenderLayers 0 and another into RenderLayers 0 and 1.\n2. Camera A has RenderLayers 0\n3. Camera B has RenderLayers 1 and a RenderTarget Image.\n\n## What went wrong\n\nWe expect to see both birds on Camera A and only one bird on Camera B, which is drawn as an ImageNode to display the RenderTarget contents.\n\nInstead we see... a random combination of birds on both cameras. ?!?\n\nExample code is here: https://github.com/dead-money/bevy_render_layers_broken\n\nEvery few seconds the example despawns everything and recreates the scene. You'll see arbitrary results.\n\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16867/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
