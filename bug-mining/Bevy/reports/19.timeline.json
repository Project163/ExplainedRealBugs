Objective\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes #11533 \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen `AssetPath`s are created from a string type, they are parsed into an `AssetSource`, a `Path`, and a `Label`.\r\nThe current method of parsing has some unnecessary quirks:\r\n\r\n- The presence of a `:` character is assumed to be the start of an asset source indicator.\r\n\t- This is not necessarily true. There are valid uses of a `:` character in an asset path, for example an http source's port such as `localhost:80`.\r\n- If there are multiple instances of `://`, the last one is assumed to be the asset source deliminator.\r\n\t- This has some unexpected behavior. Even in a fully formed path, such as `http://localhost:80`, the `:` between `localhost` and `80` is assumed to be the start of an asset source, causing an error since it does not form the full sequence `://`.\r\n- The very first asset label delimiter `#` is used to determine the asset label, and all further parsing and validation stops there.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nChanges the `AssetPath`'s `parse_internal` method to be more permissive.\r\n- Only the exact sequence `://` is taken to be the asset source delimiter, and only the first one if there are multiple.\r\n- Only the last `#` is taken to be the asset label delimiter.\r\n- The asset label delimiter `#` cannot be contained in the asset source.\r\n- The asset source delimiter `://` cannot be contained in the asset label.\r\n\r\nThe `ParseAssetPathError` enum and the doc tests have been updated to reflect these new conditions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11543/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11610638091,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U859QmczzwAAAAK0DEcL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11610638091","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-26T16:16:27Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Triage","color":"D876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11610638095,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U859QmczzwAAAAK0DEcP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11610638095","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-26T16:16:27Z","label":{"name":"A-Assets","color":"c6a751"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11613514113,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U859QmczzwAAAAK0OCmB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11613514113","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"182c21dc586e538d6545bb69b747b64d9e43da84","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/182c21dc586e538d6545bb69b747b64d9e43da84","created_at":"2024-01-26T21:36:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11613514221,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U859QmczzwAAAAK0OCnt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11613514221","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.githu
