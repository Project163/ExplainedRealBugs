So I wanted to strip out any crates that had to do with higher level rendering. So I configured my features as above.\n\n## What went wrong\n\nDespite this several crates (bevy_input_focus, bevy_camera, bevy_mesh) I don't want still got compiled in.\n\n## Additional information\n\nThis series of deps seems to be the main issue:\n```\n$ cargo tree -i bevy_mesh\nbevy_mesh v0.17.2\n└── bevy_camera v0.17.2\n    └── bevy_picking v0.17.2\n        └── bevy_input_focus v0.17.2\n            └── bevy_winit v0.17.2\n                └── bevy_internal v0.17.2\n                    └── bevy v0.17.2\n```\nAsking for windows should not result in a bunch of picking and 3d stuff to come along with it.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21413/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
