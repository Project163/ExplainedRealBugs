Objective\r\n\r\nWhen introduced, `Single` was intended to simply be silently skipped, allowing for graceful and efficient handling of systems during invalid game states (such as when the player is dead).\r\n\r\nHowever, this also caused missing resources to *also* be silently skipped, leading to confusing and very hard to debug failures. In 0.15.1, this behavior was reverted to a panic, making missing resources easier to debug, but largely making `Single` (and `Populated`) worthless, as they would panic during expected game states.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the consensus is that this behavior should differ on  a per-system-param basis. However, there was no sensible way to *do* that before this PR.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nSwap `SystemParam::validate_param` from a `bool` to:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n/// The outcome of system / system param validation,\r\n/// used by system executors to determine what to do with a system.\r\npub enum ValidationOutcome {\r\n    /// All system parameters were validated successfully and the system can be run.\r\n    Valid,\r\n    /// At least one system parameter failed validation, and an error must be handled.\r\n    /// By default, this will result in1 a panic. See [crate::error] for more information.\r\n    ///\r\n    /// This is the default behavior, and is suitable for system params that should *always* be valid,\r\n    /// either because sensible fallback behavior exists (like [`Query`] or because\r\n    /// failures in validation should be considered a bug in the user's logic that must be immediately addressed (like [`Res`]).\r\n    Invalid,\r\n    /// At least one system parameter failed validation, but the system should be skipped due to [`ValidationBehavior::Skip`].\r\n    /// This is suitable for system params that are intended to only operate in certain application states, such as [`Single`].\r\n    Skipped,\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen, inside of each `SystemParam` implementation, return either Valid, Invalid or Skipped.\r\n\r\nCurrently, only `Single`, `Option<Single>` and `Populated` use the `Skipped` behavior. Other params (like resources) retain their current failing\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nMessed around with the fallible_params example. Added a pair of tests: one for panicking when resources are missing, and another for properly skipping `Single` and `Populated` system params.\r\n\r\n## To do\r\n\r\n- [x] get https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18454 merged\r\n- [x] fix the todo!() in the macro-powered tuple implementation (please help 🥺)\r\n- [x] test\r\n- [x] write a migration guide\r\n- [x] update the example comments\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nVarious system and system parameter validation methods (`SystemParam::validate_param`, `System::validate_param` and `System::validate_param_unsafe`) now return and accept a `ValidationOutcome` enum, rather than a `bool`.  The previous `true` values map to `ValidationOutcome::Valid`, while `false` maps to `ValidationOutcome::Invalid`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you wrote a custom schedule executor, you should now respect the new `ValidationOutcome::Skipped` parameter, skipping any systems whose validation was skipped. By contrast, `ValidationOutcome::Invalid` systems should also be skipped, but you should call the `default_error_handler` on them first, which by default will result in a panic.\r\n\r\nIf you are implementing a custom `SystemParam`, you should consider whether failing system param validation is an error or an expected state, and choose between `Invalid` and `Skipped` accordingly. In Bevy itself, `Single` and `Populated` now once again skip the system when their conditions are not met. This is the 0.15.0 behavior, but stands in contrast to the 0.15.1 behavior, where they would panic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18504/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2781188421","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18453#issuecomment-2781188421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18453","id":2781188421,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86lxZFF","user":{"login":"ElliottjPierce","id":79881080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODgxMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79881080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce","html_url":"https://github.com/ElliottjPierce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-06T02:48:30Z","updated_at":"2025-04-06T02:48:30Z","body":"After aquatinting myself roughly with how this all works, I'm kinda stumped as to where to draw the line on this abstraction. `SimpleExecutor` and `SingleThreadedExecutor` are nearly identical and `MultiThreadedExecutor` is completely different. It further complicates things that we'd kinda need a data level abstraction too between `SimpleExecutor` and `SingleThreadedExecutor`.\n\nIf we still want to do this, I'll probably end up just making some utility functions like `evaluate_and_fold_conditions` that are used mostly between `SimpleExecutor` and `SingleThreadedExecutor`.\n\nAs an alternative, why not get rid of `SimpleExecutor`? It looks like `SingleThreadedExecutor` basically fills the same purpose; it just does it better/more efficiently. The only use case I can think of for `SimpleExecutor` is a ton of systems that all need to be applied deferred. But then, why not an exclusive system? If users are concerned about performance, they won't have that use case, and if they're not, they won't mind switching to `SingleThreadedExecutor`. If we went that route, there would be very little duplication, and what little would be left, I'd argue would be more clear not abstracted.\n\nUp to you, but what do you think about that?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2781188421/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ElliottjPierce","id":79881080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODgxMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79881080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce","html_url":"https://github.com/ElliottjPierce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2781516918","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18453#issuecomment-2781516918","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18453","id":2781516918,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86lypR2","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-06T17:11:46Z","updated_at":"2025-04-06T17:11:46Z","body":"> As an alternative, why not get rid of SimpleExecutor?\n\nThis was created as part of an effort to make scheduling more approachable for users who didn't care about performance.

are a great tool for executing a graph of systems. In their current form, however, schedules impose a specific execution model: systems grouped into system sets with order constraints and run conditions. We should extend the scheduling API to become reusable in more scenarios.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThese problem domains involve a system graph, but have a different execution model:\n\n- `bevy_render`'s `RenderGraph` and `Node` APIs are shaped very similarly to a system graph, but differ in their execution model: nodes have read-only access to the world and can be executed fully in parallel, but their commands must be applied in-order. Therefore, the scheduling API cannot (yet) be reused to implement them as a system graph.\n- Observers are a kind of system graph, but focusing on entities. Reusing the scheduling API would provide a more consistent API surface, and easily enable things like observer ordering (if warranted).\n- My [utility AI library](https://github.com/EvergreenNest/evergreen_utility_ai/blob/ee52d095d43dbf06aa1484f1bbc603800bf1d1a1/src/flow.rs) links systems' output scores to other systems' inputs for score aggregation. Additionally, all systems have read-only access. I've copied quite a lot of the scheduling API's surface, and would love to not need to maintain it myself.\n- @urben1680 has a crate for reversible schedules that could be vastly simplified if it didn't have to work around the scheduling API's imposed execution model.\n- Users have occasionally shown interest in statically-dispatched schedules, and while this is easy to do with repeated calls to `run_system_cached`, the UX could be improved by reusing some of the scheduling API.\n\nThere are a few more examples that verge on the theoretical, but as you can see this is an open problem space.\n\n# Goals\n\n- Provide reusable building blocks for:\n    - creating and updating system graphs\n    - creating serial and parallel schedule executors\n- Minimize boilerplate for the most common cases.\n- Enable dynamic schedule modification\n- Remove barriers for building schedule inspection tooling\n\n# Non-Goals\n\n- Provide first party solutions for all third party use cases.\n\n# Roadmap (very rough)\n\n- Clean up `bevy_ecs::schedule`\n    - #20080\n    - #20100\n    - #20119\n    - #20172\n    - #20196\n    - #20256\n    - #21608\n- #18453\n- Expose generic system container and graph primitives\n- Provide user-implementable traits to allow custom execution models\n- Provide primitives for constructing serial and parallel executors for custom execution models\n- Switch `bevy_render` to a render-graph-as-systems approach","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ElliottjPierce","id":79881080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODgxMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79881080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce","html_url":"https://github.com/ElliottjPierce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-22T22:52:50Z","updated_at":"2025-09-22T22:52:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21176","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21176/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21176/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21176/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/21176","id":3443023143,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86p9FU2","number":21176,"title":"Revived #18741, Remove `SimpleExecutor`.","user":{"login":"ElliottjPierce","id":79881080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODgxMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79881080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce","html_url":"https://github.com/ElliottjPierce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619327,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/D-Trivial","name":"D-Trivial","color":"008672","default":false,"description":"Nice and easy!
