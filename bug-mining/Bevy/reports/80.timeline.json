So one option is to keep around LegacyColor for one more release cycle, even though no APIs are actually using it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1960511069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"viridia","id":1166135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia","html_url":"https://github.com/viridia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1960603345","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12056#issuecomment-1960603345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12056","id":1960603345,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U8503G7R","user":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-23T01:14:15Z","updated_at":"2024-02-23T01:14:15Z","body":"I strongly prefer a full hard switch PR where we can tweak / polish / evaluate the new approach in full. \"Half ports\" risk optimizing for the wrong things because we aren't using the new types in contexts that might inform their design.\r\n\r\nLikewise, I think a \"middle ground / support both\" release would just be confusing and introduce more churn than ripping off the bandaid right away.

Renaming Color to LegacyColor isn't going to break users code by itself, because we are also at the same time going to add a type alias which defines Color = LegacyColor\r\n\r\nOops I glossed over that / didn't fully process the implications of the type alias (allowing Color to continue to resolve to the old type).\r\n\r\n> I also think that you may be underestimating the degree of user unhappiness generated by introducing a breaking change like this, with no prior warning. \r\n\r\nThis may be true, but note that I _am_ expecting users to be unhappy with this breakage. From my perspective deprecation only serves to confuse and prolong the situation more:\r\n\r\n* I feel strongly about a full internal port before releasing the new color types (and I suspect others will feel similarly, but this is still open to discussion). If we do that, I expect a high percentage of cases to look like `sprite.color = Color::rgb(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);`, where `Color` is `LegacyColor` and `sprite.color` is `bevy::color::Color`. These cases will not have a soft landing, even if `LegacyColor` implements `Into<NewColor>`. Callers will need to manually add `into()` calls, or move to the new type.\r\n* Color is currently in the prelude, so if the goal is to not break people (with a full rename to LegacyColor), we can't add the new Color to the prelude too, meaning people will get warnings to port `bevy::prelude::Color` (likely imported via `bevy::prelude::*`) to `bevy::color::Color`. People resolving the warning will end up with a bunch of _manually typed_ soon-to-be-unnecessary imports in their codebase  (manually typed because Rust Analyzer will not help with if you already have Color in scope via a full prelude import). \r\n\r\nThat being said, I'm less opposed to the \"deprecation\" part of the proposal than I am to the \"partial port across releases\" part of the proposal. I'd still be reasonably happy with the approach: \"full port, with a soft landing by keeping the old Color type around for a release\". I just expect the \"support both / soft landing\" approach to introduce additional weirdness and comparable levels of discomfort (and likely greater amounts of discomfort, when the porting process is considered as a whole).\r\n\r\n> Also, I was one of the people involved with the Python 2.x -> 3.0 language evolution, which was far more painful than anyone had predicted - what we thought would take a year ended up taking ten years (it's a long story).\r\n\r\nOooh interesting.

If we can identify every case ahead of time (and develop a \"port strategy\" that we agree is a net-win ahead of time), I'm more willing to break this up across PRs (especially if we commit to doing the full port before the next release). The concerns I would like mitigated:\r\n\r\n1. Committing to an API before we know its fitness for our codebase. Aka merging a partial port of the codebase, only to discover a later case isn't well suited to the API we have chosen.\r\n2. Having a partial port on `main` for a long period of time, complicating the lives of consumers of `main`\r\n3.

You can expect PRs to start showing up within the next couple days. This is a good thing, but we may want to exercise some restraint - once those PRs get merged we are pretty much committed unless we plan to revert them later.\r\n\r\nFor example, one strategy might be to release bevy_colors in 0.13.1, with no changes to Bevy APIs - a \"preview\" of what's coming, which will then give users several months to get used to the idea that the Bevy APIs will change in 0.14.\r\n\r\nBTW, I want to push back on the idea of renaming `Srgba` to `Color`. I want to quote Albert Einstein here: \"Things should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.\" I'm all for making things simple for new users, but we should avoid hiding important details that they need to know.

If we go that route, it would likely need to be Srgba->Color _and_ LinearSrgba->LinearColor to create the appropriate parity (especially if we're using LinearSrgba/LinearColor for StandardMaterial). Terminology-wise I personally don't see a fundamental problem with designating Srgba \"Color\", given that the rest of the industry does that, and people will gravitate toward that name for obvious reasons. But I'm largely undecided atm. I currently feel more strongly about the reverse: that `Color` likely wants a less friendly name if we're going to encourage the use of Srgba / LinearSrgba naming.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1961999531/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1962001450","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12056#issuecomment-1962001450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12056","id":1962001450,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U8508cQq","user":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-23T21:17:53Z","updated_at":"2024-02-23T21:17:53Z","body":"> One thing to bear in mind is that there are a number of people who are gung-ho to start migrating Bevy right now.

They are:\r\n\r\n1. Global configurable data to be passed directly to the renderer (e.g. fog, gizmos).\r\n2. Components that store a configurable color (e.g. UiColor, Sprite). \r\n2. Special case data hardcoded in rendering internals (White/Black/None clear colors are virtually all of it).\r\n4. Arbitrary color constants chosen to make the colors look nice. Usually specified in RGB space.\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much it. 1 and 2 are the most controversial: we should pick a single standard and use it everywhere. As I see it, our options:\r\n\r\n1. Polymorphic color type (like before): annoying to right, probably slower, requires conversion. Easy to make nice in an editor and in scenes (thanks @JMS55 for pointing this out), since you can quickly see exactly what value you set, work in different color spaces and parse values.\r\n2. Standard RGBA: plays nice with color pickers online. The \"obvious\" and familiar choice, but still requires conversions.\r\n3. Linear RGBA: avoid constant conversions for rendering. Will give subtly different values than expected relative to color pickers.\r\n\r\n3 should clearly just be linear RGB. 4 is the most lines of code, but should be trivial to migrate regardless of the choice we take. If we pick a polymorphic color type it's trivial, otherwise just call .into() or add `impl Into` constructors on the component types.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1962098809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11908895281,"node_id":"MEE_lADODf6-U86AJ_g8zwAAAALF01Ix","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11908895281","actor":{"login":"JMS55","id":47158642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTU4NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47158642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55","html_url":"https://github.com/JMS55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-23T22:46:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11908895286,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86AJ_g8zwAAAALF01I2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11908895286","actor":{"login":"JMS55","id":47158642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTU4NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47158642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55","html_url":"https://github.com/JMS55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-23T22:46:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1962128048","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12056#issuecomment-1962128048","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12056","id":1962128048,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U85087Kw","user":{"login":"viridia","id":1166135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia","html_url":"https://github.com/viridia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-23T23:20:39Z","updated_at":"2024-02-23T23:20:39Z","body":"@alice-i-cecile
