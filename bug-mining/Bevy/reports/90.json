Attempt to create a window with a specific resolution and scale factor using Bevy.\r\n2. Set the scale factor using the `with_scale_factor_override` builder method.\r\n3. Run the application and observe the window size.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    App::new()\r\n        .add_plugins(\r\n            DefaultPlugins\r\n                .set(ImagePlugin::default_nearest())\r\n                .set(WindowPlugin {\r\n                    primary_window: Some(Window {\r\n                        title: String::from(\"My Game\"),\r\n                        resolution: WindowResolution::new(200., 200.)\r\n                            .with_scale_factor_override(8.),\r\n                        ..default()\r\n                    }),\r\n                    ..default()\r\n                })\r\n        )\r\n        .run();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nThe window should display with a size adjusted according to the specified scale factor.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior:**\r\nThe window retains its original size, disregarding the scale factor override.\r\n\r\n**Additional Information:**\r\n- The `set_scale_factor_override` method sets the scale factor override correctly.\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let mut resolution = WindowResolution::new(200., 200.);\r\n    resolution.set_scale_factor_override(Some(8.));\r\n\r\n    App::new()\r\n        .add_plugins(\r\n            DefaultPlugins\r\n                .set(ImagePlugin::default_nearest())\r\n                .set(WindowPlugin {\r\n                    primary_window: Some(Window {\r\n                        title: String::from(\"My Game\"),\r\n                        resolution,\r\n                        ..default()\r\n                    }),\r\n                    ..default()\r\n                })\r\n        )\r\n        .run();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Resolution:**\r\nThe 'with_scale_factor_override' method should use 'self.set()' to set the physical pixels with the scaled resolution like the 'set_scale_factor_override' method does.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12282/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
