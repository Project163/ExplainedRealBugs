border with the intention of moving or resizing the window pauses the render loop. \n\nI was somewhat expecting that it might pause when the the top section of the border is clicked and dragged for moving the window, but was surprised that resizing also paused execution due to the way that winit is designed.\n\nIt would be nice if bevy provided a way to run the window event processing on a different thread from the render loop thread (on supported platforms) so that window movement and resizing would not cause the application to stop execution.

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #16817\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nCurrently `RequestRedraw` events can be missed in `about_to_wait()` as it is can call `run_app_update()` after reading the event cursor, thus the `redraw_requested` flag is stale.\r\n\r\nThis adds a subsequent read after the call to `run_app_update` to ensure `redraw_requested` is updated if any events were sent during the update.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTested in `Reactive` mode with animations using a forked `bevy_tweening` which supports 0.16-dev and sends `RequestRedraw` events while there are any `Animator` components active.\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, the animation would only run a single update, and would stall for the reactive mode timeout before continuing the animation.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, the animation runs smooth in Reactive mode. Tested on MacOS and iOS on iPad and iPhone.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16418721757,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86nGVmwzwAAAAPSoc_d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16418721757","actor":{"login":"extrawurst","id":776816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NjgxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/776816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/extrawurst","html_url":"https://github.com/extrawurst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/extrawurst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/extrawurst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/extrawurst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/extrawurst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/extrawurst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/extrawurst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/extrawurst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/extrawurst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/extrawurst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-23T10:25:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"aloucks","id":221559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTU1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/221559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks","html_url":"https://github.com/aloucks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-23T21:32:46Z","updated_at":"2025-02-23T21:32:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18004","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18004/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18004/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18004/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18004","id":2873482539,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86MNeHR","number":18004,"title":"Fix window freezing when dragged or resized on Windows","user":{"login":"aloucks","id":221559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTU1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/221559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks","html_url":"https://github.com/aloucks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloucks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2272055811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjcyMDU1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-Windowing","name":"A-Windowing","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Platform-agnostic interface layer to run your app in"},{"id":2272060460,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjcyMDYwNDYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/O-Windows","name":"O-Windows","color":"2e6991","default":false,"description":"Specific to the Windows desktop operating system"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #17488\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe world update logic happened in the the `about_to_wait` winit window callback, but this is is not correct as (1) the winit documentation states that the callback should not be used for that purpose and (2) the callback is not fired when the window is resized or being dragged. However, that callback was used in #11245 to fix an iOS bug (which caused the regression). The solution presented here is a workaround until the event loop code can be re-written. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI confirmed that the `eased_motion` example continued to be animated when dragging or resizing the window.
