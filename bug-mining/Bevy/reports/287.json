Bevy version\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/releases/tag/v0.14.0-rc.3\r\n\r\n## What you did\r\n\r\nI used the `Debug` implementation in various logging and displaying of Entities, such as `info!(\"My enetity: {:?}\", entity)`.\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\nIn the RC version the `Debug` implementation was replaced to be in sync with the serialized version, HOWEVER, the `Display` implementation does not match that of the previous `Debug`.\r\n\r\n- Before: `737v1`\r\n- After `737v1|4294968033`\r\n\r\nThis means that the previous short version no longer exists and if someone wishes to debug they will have a really long text, if they use display (such as in an editor) the text is needlessly long too.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13980/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13980/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
