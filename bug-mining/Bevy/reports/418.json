In my case, I'd rather turn off sprite picking and use a custom, fine-grained bounding box picking backend instead. At the moment there is no way to opt-in to picking but opt-out of particular backends.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nFeatures seem like the right way to do this.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nCould use a configuration resource or something, but that seems excessive.
