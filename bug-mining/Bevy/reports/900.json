By default the original entity keeps it's component and this operation requires the component to be clone-able. \n\nHowever, if the component is moved, so the original entity loses the component, this should be no requirement. But it currently is. Move operations just fail silently\n\n```rs\n#[derive(Component)] // adding Clone or Reflect makes the assertions not fail\nstruct NoCloneImpl;\n\nlet mut world = World::new();\nlet entity1 = world.spawn_empty().id();\nlet entity2 = world\n    .spawn(NoCloneImpl)\n    .move_components::<NoCloneImpl>(entity1) // fails silently\n    .id();\n\nassert_eq!(world.entity(entity1).contains::<NoCloneImpl>(), true); // panic\nassert_eq!(world.entity(entity2).contains::<NoCloneImpl>(), false); // panic\n```\n(The same effect can be observed with `EntityCloner`)\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nMake it possible to move components without them implementing `Clone` nor `Reflect`.\n\n## Additional context\n\nThis was an open todo from @eugineerd, mentioning that it is tricky to not have the component be dropped twice. I just wanted to open this issue so it is written down somewhere.\n\n(Not sure if this is a bug issue or feature request issue)","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18079/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
