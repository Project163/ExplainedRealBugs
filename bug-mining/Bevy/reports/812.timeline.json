What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nThis issue is a replacement and extension of #17517, which attempts to solve the same problem by creating an optionally `!Send` `World` using generics. The problems with `!Send` resources listed in that issue are the same issues we are trying to solve here:\n> `NonSend` resources are confusing (they don't impl `Resource`!), badly named ([#13481](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/13481)), require API duplication and hamper us when implementing valuable new ECS features like [#17485](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17485).\n> \n> That said, not everything we might want to stick in and access from the ECS is threadsafe! Audio, window handles, scripting language integrations and more are all inherently !Send. Simply removing them is not an option. Ultimately, the problem is that our model here is muddy, hampering our ability to teach, reason about and safely improve these areas of code.\n> \n> Simultaneously, users have requested support for [`!Send` components](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1331346448662397059/1331817541202477197), particularly for use with web or scripting languages.\n\nThrough [discussion on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1332109626962874468) and experimentation, we have determined that making `World` optionally `!Send` using generics is a bit messy and hacky, and we want a more long-term solution rather than a work-around.\n\nIn summary, we need to solve these problems:\n1. Eliminate `!Send` resources so the [resources-as-components](#17485) effort can be unblocked, and...\n2. Find a place to store the data from those `!Send` resources while still supporting their `!Send` status\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\n### Short term\n\nShort term, we can replace `!Send` resources with `thread_local!`. This will unblock the resources-as-components effort. However, `thread_local!` requires `std`, which conflicts with Bevy's support for `no_std`, so this is not a good long-term solution.\n\nLong term, @bushrat011899 brought up supporting both `Send` and `!Send` `World`s in the same binary. This would allow us to store the data that is currently in `!Send` resources in it's own `!Send` `World` as `!Send` components (since resources-as-components aims to remove the concept of resources altogether). If data needs to be shared from the `Send` `World` to the `!Send` `World`, @maniwani has suggested an API feature for sending functions to be run on other worlds. Usage might look something like this:\n```rust\nfn send_something_to_foo_world(\n    mut worlds: Worlds,\n    foo_world: Res<FooWorld>,\n) {\n    let id: WorldId = *foo_world.0;\n    worlds.get_mut(id).block_on(move |mut world| {\n        // Something to run on the world with non-send Foo stuff\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### Long term\n\nThe long-term plan looks like this:\n1. We make non-send resources `thread_local!` so that resources-as-components is unblocked #17682\n2. Create inter-thread executor that allows a system to execute arbitrary code on the main thread. This is needed because currently the only way to ensure a System runs on the main thread is to use `!Send` system params, which is getting removed. We need to ensure any `thread_local!`s are running on the same thread they're created in. #18172\n3. Create official support for `Send` and `!Send` `World` in a single binary    a. More details to follow\n4. Move `thread_local!` global vars into a new `!Send` `World` as `!Send` componentsMore issues will be created to break this work out further## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n5. Move main `World` to a thread that is not main thread\n\nSome ideas we have discussed:\n1. Only officially supporting `Send` `World` (not supporting `!Send` `World`) and requiring that users store their own `!Send` data. However, that would come at the cost of worse UX\n2. Only supporting *either* a `Send` `World` *or* a `!Send` `World` in the same binary, but not both simultaneously and using a separate data store for `!Send` global data to replace our `!Send` resource usage. However, this would require the creation of a new `!Send` data store, which can be solved automatically by just creating support for `Send` and `!Send` `World`s to co-exist. Imo, it is cleaner to use a `!Send` `World` as a `!Send` data store and doesn't require us to re-engineer something we already have implemented. Plus having a `Send` and `!Send` `World` co-exist in the same binary is more dynamically useful (it's more general and has potential to be more generally useful to end users and/or other bevy teams to solve a variety of other problems).\n\n## Why 🐢 turtle emoji?\n\nBecause that's the name of the [Discord work group](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1332109626962874468) that discusses this issue.

is a sub-issue of #17667. See that issue for more high-level details.\n\nMake sure #17682 is completed before working on this issue.\n\n## What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\n`World` is currently `Send`, but cannot be dropped in a different thread than it was created in due to `!Send` resources that it owns. If dropped in the wrong thread, the program will panic. This is not desired behavior.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nAdd a feature flag that will toggle between these 2 states:\n1. All of `World` and it's components (and resources) are `Send`\n2. All of `World` and it's components (and resources) are `!Send`\n\nThat way `World` is always either completely `Send` or completely `!Send`, instead of it's current mixed state, and flipping between them is controlled with a feature flag.\n\n## Additional context\n\nThis solution requires that all `World`s in a single binary are either `Send` or `!Send`. There is a future issue created for allowing both `Send` and `!Send` `World`s to exist in the same binary, but that is for a later step. This solution is an intermediate solution and a part of the larger scope of #17667. What this issue hopes to accomplish is to do the following:\n\n1. Make behavior of `World` more expected by allowing `Send` `World` to be dropped in any thread without panicking\n2. Allow the option for binaries to use purely `!Send` `World`s, which is currently desired by developers of web-based apps and some niche targets like Gameboy.\n3. Setup bevy `World`s to distinctly choose between `Send` and `!Send` so the future transition to inclusively support `Send` and `!Send` `World`s in the same binary is smoother","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"joshua-holmes","id":91363480,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzYzNDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91363480?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes","html_url":"https://github.com/joshua-holmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-07T20:45:49Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T20:45:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17730","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17730/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17730/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17730/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17730","id":2839056708,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86Kd5UW","number":17730,"title":"Replace some `!Send` resources with `thread_local!`","user":{"login":"joshua-holmes","id":91363480,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzYzNDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91363480?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes","html_url":"https://github.com/joshua-holmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Feature","name":"C-Feature","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A new feature, making something new possible"},{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Objective\r\n\r\nWork for issue #17682 \r\n\r\nWhat's in this PR:\r\n* Removal of some `!Send` resources that Bevy uses internally\r\n* Replaces `!Send` resources with `thread_local!` static\r\n\r\nWhat this PR does not cover:\r\n* The ability to create `!Send` resources still exists\r\n* Tests that test `!Send` resources are present (and should not be removed until the ability to create `!Send` resources is removed)\r\n* The example `log_layers_ecs` still uses a `!Send` resource. In this example, removing the `!Send` resource results in the system that uses it running on a thread other than the main thread, which doesn't work with lazily initialized `thread_local!` static data. Removing this `!Send` resource will need to be deferred until the System API is extended to support configuring which thread the System runs on.

Objective\r\n\r\nCreate new `NonSendMarker` that does not depend on `NonSend`.\r\n\r\nRequired, in order to accomplish #17682. In that issue, we are trying to replace `!Send` resources with `thread_local!` in order to unblock the resources-as-components effort. However, when we remove all the `!Send` resources from a system, that allows the system to run on a thread other than the main thread, which is against the design of the system. So this marker gives us the control to require a system to run on the main thread without depending on `!Send` resources.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nCreate a new `NonSendMarker` to replace the existing one that does not depend on `NonSend`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nOther than running tests, I ran a few examples:\r\n- `window_resizing`\r\n- `wireframe`\r\n- `volumetric_fog` (looks so cool)\r\n- `rotation`\r\n- `button`\r\n\r\nThere is a Mac/iOS-specific change and I do not have a Mac or iOS device to test it. I am doubtful that it would cause any problems for 2 reasons:\r\n1. The change is the same as the non-wasm change which I did test\r\n2. The Pixel Eagle tests run Mac tests\r\n\r\nBut it wouldn't hurt if someone wanted to spin up an example that utilizes the `bevy_render` crate, which is where the Mac/iSO change was.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nIf `NonSendMarker` is being used from `bevy_app::prelude::*`, replace it with `bevy_ecs::system::NonSendMarker` or use it from `bevy_ecs::prelude::*`. In addition to that, `NonSendMarker` does not need to be wrapped like so:\r\n```rust\r\nfn my_system(_non_send_marker: Option<NonSend<NonSendMarker>>) {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, it can be used without any wrappers:\r\n```rust\r\nfn my_system(_non_send_marker: NonSendMarker) {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18301/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18301/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"joshua-holmes","id":91363480,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzYzNDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91363480?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes","html_url":"https://github.com/joshua-holmes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshua-holmes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-18T03:09:30Z","updated_at":"2025-03-18T03:09:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18386","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18386/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18386/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18386/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18386","id":2926954190,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86PBoLZ","number":18386,"title":"Remove

First half of work for that issue was completed in [PR 17730](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17730). However, the rest of the work ended up getting blocked because we needed a way of forcing systems to run on the main thread without the use of `!Send` resources. That was unblocked by [PR 18301](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18301).\r\n\r\nThis work should finish unblocking the resources-as-components effort.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nRan several
