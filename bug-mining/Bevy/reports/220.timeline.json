Objective\r\n- Introduce variants of `LoadContext::load_direct` which allow picking asset type & configuring settings.\r\n- Fixes #12963.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- Implements `ErasedLoadedAsset::downcast` and adds some accessors to `LoadedAsset<A>`.\r\n- Changes `load_direct`/`load_direct_with_reader` to be typed, and introduces `load_direct_untyped`/`load_direct_untyped_with_reader`.\r\n- Introduces `load_direct_with_settings` and `load_direct_with_reader_and_settings`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- I've run cargo test and played with the examples which use `load_direct`.\r\n- I also extended the `asset_processing` example to use the new typed version of `load_direct` and use `load_direct_with_settings`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n- Introduced new `load_direct` methods in `LoadContext` to allow specifying type & settings\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n- `LoadContext::load_direct` has been renamed to `LoadContext::load_direct_untyped`. You may find the new `load_direct` is more appropriate for your use case (and the migration may only be moving one type parameter).\r\n- `LoadContext::load_direct_with_reader` has been renamed to `LoadContext::load_direct_untyped_with_reader`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis might not be an obvious win as a solution because it introduces quite a few new `load_direct` alternatives - but it does follow the existing pattern pretty well. I'm very open to alternatives. :sweat_smile: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12884150961,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86FpfShzwAAAAL_9Iqx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12884150961","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"26df1c1179a07fe3f28d84db33592bc771e5af2d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/26df1c1179a07fe3f28d84db33592bc771e5af2d","created_at":"2024-05-21T18:47:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12884151039,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86FpfShzwAAAAL_9Ir_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12884151039","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-21T18:47:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
