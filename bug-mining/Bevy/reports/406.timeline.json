Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #15106\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Trivial refactor to rename the method. The duplicate method `push` was removed as well. This will simpify the API and make the semantics more clear. `Add` implies that the action happens immediately, whereas in reality, the command is queued to be run eventually.\r\n- `ChildBuilder::add_command` has similarly been renamed to `queue_command`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests should suffice for this simple refactor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- `Commands::add` and `Commands::push` have been replaced with `Commnads::queue`.\r\n- `ChildBuilder::add_command` has been renamed to `ChildBuilder::queue_command`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14282611246,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86Vxa_xzwAAAANTT1ou","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14282611246","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b45d83ebda8f4956f59fa30cc6f03f5c11fc494f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/b45d83ebda8f4956f59fa30cc6f03f5c11fc494f","created_at":"2024-09-17T00:33:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14282611341,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86Vxa_xzwAAAANTT1qN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14282611341","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-17T00:33:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
