Then, spawn an entity with that component in an implementation of `Command::apply` using `World::spawn`. Here is the MRE (excluding `App` creation and observer/system insertion):\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct MyComponent;\n\nfn on_add(trigger: Trigger<OnAdd, MyComponent>, mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands\n        .entity(trigger.target())\n        .with_related::<ChildOf>(|rsc| {\n            rsc.spawn_empty();\n        });\n}\n\nstruct MyCommand;\n\nimpl Command for MyCommand {\n    fn apply(self, world: &mut World) -> () {\n        world.spawn(MyComponent);\n    }\n}\n\nfn startup(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.queue(MyCommand);\n}\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\nIt is claimed that the entity doesn't exist. The following error is emitted, and the app crashes:\n\n```\nthread 'main' panicked at C:\\Users\\Jason\\.cargo\\git\\checkouts\\bevy-50d7e162b728c6c6\\821f6fa\\crates\\bevy_ecs\\src\\error\\handler.rs:129:1:\nEncountered an error in command `<bevy_ecs::system::commands::entity_command::insert<bevy_ecs::hierarchy::ChildOf>::{{closure}} as bevy_ecs::error::command_handling::CommandWithEntity<core::result::Result<(), bevy_ecs::world::error::EntityMutableFetchError>>>::with_entity::{{closure}}`: EntityDoesNotExist(EntityDoesNotExistError { entity: 11v1#4294967307, details: EntityDoesNotExistDetails { location: MaybeLocation { marker: PhantomData<core::option::Option<&core::panic::location::Location>> } } })\n```\n\n## Additional information\n\nThe same thing happens with `on_add` hooks directly on the component as opposed to an observer. If I spawn the component using `Commands` instead of `World`, it works as expected.\n\nIn version 0.15.x, I was able to perform spawning using this exact pattern without this error.\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18452/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
