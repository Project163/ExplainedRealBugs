Objective\r\n\r\nIn PR #15812 ImageLoader was moved from bevy_render to bevy_image but a reference to old path was left in a meta file used by `asset_settings` example. This resulted in one of sprites used by this example to not be displayed.\r\n\r\nFixes #15932\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nCorrect the loader reference in the meta file used by `asset_settings` example (I've found no other meta files referencing this loader).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI've run `bevy_assets` example. It now displays 3 sprites (as expected) and outputs no errors.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThis PR obviously requires no migration guide as this is just a bug-fix, but I believe that #15812 should mention that meta files needs updating. Proposal:\r\n\r\n* Asset loader name must be updated in `.meta` files for images.\r\nChange: `loader: \"bevy_render::texture::image_loader::ImageLoader\",`\r\nto: `loader: \"bevy_image::image_loader::ImageLoader\",`\r\nIt will fix the following error: ``no `AssetLoader` found with the name 'bevy_render::texture::image_loader::ImageLoader``\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15945/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14682062246,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86aVXuTzwAAAANrHn2m","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14682062246","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e4f501cb4a113e1f7f40c6aa42145111740a3db6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/e4f501cb4a113e1f7f40c6aa42145111740a3db6","created_at":"2024-10-16T14:35:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14682062611,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86aVXuTzwAAAANrHn8T","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14682062611","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-16T14:35:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
