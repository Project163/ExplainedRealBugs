`6.13.8-arch1-1`) :\n```\nthread 'Compute Task Pool (15)' panicked at ~/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/bevy_pbr-0.16.0-rc.4/src/render/light.rs:1820:84:\ncalled `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value\nEncountered a panic in system `bevy_pbr::render::light::specialize_shadows<bevy_pbr::pbr_material::StandardMaterial>`!\n```\n\n## Additional information\n- This **DOES** panic, even if the Mesh is moved far away from the light before the despawn\n    - e.g.: after 1 sec: move mesh to Y:1000. | after 2 secs: despawn | => panic\n- This DOESN'T panic when the camera is moving slower or is zoomed out more\n   - e.g. set `SPEED=15.;` or `ZOOM=200.;`\n- This DOESN'T panic when the light was never 'in view' of the Camera\n   - e.g. set `CAM_Y=50.;`\n- This DOESN'T panic when the Mesh doesn't have `NoFrustumCulling`\n\n- This DIDN'T panic in bevy_pbr `0.16.0-rc.3`\n\nI believe there are more setups where this happens even without using `NoFrustumCulling`, but that's the only minimal one I could come up with.\n\nNote: The panic is the same as in #18809 and may be related.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18823/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17235666870,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86yJKryzwAAAAQDU2e2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17235666870","actor":{"login":"brianreavis","id":118480,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODQ4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118480?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianreavis","html_url":"https://github.com/brianreavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianreavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianreavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianreavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianreavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianreavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianreavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianreavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianreavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianreavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-12T22:42:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17238014228,"node_id":"AE_lADODf6-U86yJKryzwAAAAQDdzkU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17238014228","actor":{"login":"tychedelia","id":10366310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY2MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10366310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia","html_url":"https://github.com/tychedelia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-13T08:05:17Z","assignee":{"login":"tychedelia","id":10366310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY2MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10366310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia","html_url":"https://github.com/tychedelia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"tychedelia","id":10366310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY2MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10366310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia","html_url":"https://github.com/tychedelia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-13T22:47:04Z","updated_at":"2025-04-13T22:47:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18836","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengi
