Objective\r\n\r\nfixes #14569\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nadded an example to the diagnostic examples and linked the code to the docs of the diagnostic library itself.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI tested locally on my laptop in a web browser. Looked fine. You are able to collapse the whole \"intro\" part of the doc to get to the links sooner (for those who may think that including the example code here is annoying to scroll through)\r\n\r\nI would like people to run ```cargo doc```  and go the bevy_diagnostic page to see if they have any issues or suggestions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1067\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-14 at 12 52 16\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70b6c18a-0bb9-4656-ba53-c416f62c6116\">","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14741/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13902748305,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86Rj_gozwAAAAM8qxqR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13902748305","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eec38004a826b4b07d9f4a30177a389465040feb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/eec38004a826b4b07d9f4a30177a389465040feb","created_at":"2024-08-15T21:11:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13902748501,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86Rj_gozwAAAAM8qxtV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13902748501","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-15T21:11:40Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
