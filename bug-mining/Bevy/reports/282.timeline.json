it\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13967/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13967/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13245816956,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86LTTYGzwAAAAMVgyB8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13245816956","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"841df150ccd08e2b60bec61ddc1ba5983427ffd1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/841df150ccd08e2b60bec61ddc1ba5983427ffd1","created_at":"2024-06-21T18:20:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13245817092,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86LTTYGzwAAAAMVgyEE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13245817092","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-21T18:20:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13245884077,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86LTTYGzwAAAAMVhCat","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13245884077","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8af12c8775d43ca1efbfb3301591075eec1bfff2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/8af12c8775d43ca1efbfb3301591075eec1bfff2","created_at":"2024-06-21T18:28:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20596736981,"node_id":"PVTISC_lADODf6-U86LTTYGzwAAAATLqUPV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20596736981","actor":{"login":"DylanD42","id":156480569,"node_id":"U_kgDOCVO0OQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156480569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DylanD42","html_url":"https://github.com/DylanD42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DylanD42/followers","following
