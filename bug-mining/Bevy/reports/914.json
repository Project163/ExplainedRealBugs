Bevy version\n\nmain\n\n## What you did\n\nI put this in a unit test on `lib.rs` of `bevy_ecs` to let me print the required components of `A` and their depth:\n\n```rs\n#[derive(Component, Default)]\n#[require(B)]\nstruct A;\n\n#[derive(Component, Default)]\n#[require(C)]\nstruct B;\n\n#[derive(Component, Default)]\n#[require(D)]\nstruct C;\n\n#[derive(Component, Default)]\nstruct D;\n\nlet mut world = World::new();\n\nlet a_id = world.register_component::<A>();\nstd::println!(\"A: {:?}\", a_id);\nstd::println!(\"B: {:?}\", world.register_component::<B>());\nstd::println!(\"C: {:?}\", world.register_component::<C>());\nstd::println!(\"D: {:?}\", world.register_component::<D>());\n\nlet required = world\n    .components()\n    .get_info(a_id)\n    .unwrap()\n    .required_components();\n\nfor (id, meta) in &required.0 {\n    std::println!(\"required id: {id:?}, inheritance_depth: {}\", meta.inheritance_depth);\n}\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\nThis prints:\n\n```\nA: ComponentId(7)\nB: ComponentId(8)\nC: ComponentId(9)\nD: ComponentId(10)\nrequired id: ComponentId(9), inheritance_depth: 1\nrequired id: ComponentId(10), inheritance_depth: 1\nrequired id: ComponentId(8), inheritance_depth: 0\n```\nAccording to the docs of `inheritance_depth` (I made the significant part bold) ...\n\n> The depth of the component requirement in the requirement hierarchy for this component.\nThis is used for determining which constructor is used in cases where there are duplicate requires.\n>\n> For example, consider the inheritance tree `X -> Y -> Z`, where `->` indicates a requirement.\n**`X -> Y` and `Y -> Z` are direct requirements with a depth of `0`, while `Z` is only indirectly\nrequired for `X` with a depth of `1`.**\n>\n> In cases where there are multiple conflicting requirements with the same depth, a higher priority\nwill be given to components listed earlier in the `require` attribute, or to the latest added requirement\nif registered at runtime.\n\n... I expect the `inheritance_depth` of `D: ComponentId(10)` to be `2`, not `1`.\n\nEither the docs are wrong or the implementation?\n\nRight now it seems this can and will cause bugs with required components.\n\n## Additional information\n\nI stumbled on this while fixing bundles becoming outdated by `World::register_required_component`. I also saw for example the issue #16406 required three PRs (plus two closed ones)  to be fixed. I can imagine this was caused by the actual issue not being found originally?.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
