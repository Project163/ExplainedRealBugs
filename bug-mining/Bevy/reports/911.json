When nodes in the tree get dropped, I need to do some cleanup, involving moving up the tree.\n\n## What went wrong\n\nThe problem is, when running the `OnReplace` observer, the `Relationship` component is already gone.\n\n## Reproduction example\n\n```rust\nApp::new()\n    .add_systems(Startup, test)\n    .add_observer(on_my_component_replace)\n    .run();\n\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct MyComponent;\n\nfn test(mut commands: Commands) {\n    let root = commands.spawn(children![MyComponent]).id();\n\n    commands.entity(root).despawn_related::<Children>();\n}\n\nfn on_my_component_replace(\n    trigger: Trigger<OnReplace, MyComponent>,\n    has_relationship: Query<Has<ChildOf>>,\n) {\n    assert!(\n        has_relationship.get(trigger.target()).unwrap(),\n        \"Entity should have a ChildOf relationship\"\n    );\n}\n```\n\n## Additional information\n\nThe problem is that `despawn_related` calls `EntityWorldMut::take<S>` to get the `RelationshipTarget` component, which removes the component. This triggers the component hooks on the `RelationshipTarget`, which then remove the relationship from all children. Only after all that, the children are actually despawned and the observers and hooks associated to their components are called.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/f1eace62f04940224ee8f6a4a98cb57b1d3c8226/crates/bevy_ecs/src/relationship/related_methods.rs#L299-L312\n\nThe simplest solution is to replace `take` with `get` and copying all children into a temporary vector:\n\n```rust\nif let Some(sources) = self.get::<S>() {\n    let sources = sources.iter().collect::<Vec<_>>();\n    self.world_scope(|world| {\n        for entity in sources {\n            if let Ok(entity_mut) = world.get_entity_mut(entity) {\n                entity_mut.despawn();\n            };\n        }\n    });\n}\n```","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
