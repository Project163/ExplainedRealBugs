Objective\r\n\r\n- Resolves #18963.\r\n- Builds on top of: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17856#issuecomment-2675201542.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Obsoleted send* methods in bevy_ecs (right now of v.0.16.1, but it's for you to decide)\r\n- Send* methods now refer to write* methods (that now have previous send* logic).\r\n- Changed tests and renamed (send -> write) other methods in bevy_ecs.\r\n- Removed send_with_caller as it is now dead code.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Did you test these changes? If so, how?\r\n- Built and tested all crates - 5 obsolete warnings, 2 from winit, 2 from assets, 1 with detailed_trace feature.\r\n\r\n- Are there any parts that need more testing?\r\n- Examples, docs and some methods are be outdated.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI decided not to fix obsolete warnings and fmt issues in other crates because I need bevy maintainers opinion on it:\nRight now, after release of Bevy 0.16.0, to write with **`EventWriter`** we need to use **write**, **write_batch**, **write_default** methods because **send**, **send_batch**, **send_default** methods were obsoleted.\n But we still have **`Events<E>`** resource with which we can also write/send events that is also very useful, but it still has old function names of **send*** methods, and that's what I want to resolve with this **PR**.\nIt requires renaming some **send -> write** in other bevy crates and examples, and before I have done this I wanted to ask bevy community:\nDo we actually need this? I agree with previous **PR** that renamed **`EventWriter`** **send** methods to **write**, because its much more intuitive now (proper **read/write**). But now we have problem with consistency of these methods.\n\n---\nI have come up with three solutions for this issue:\n1) We will revert previous PR, and will continue to refer to writing an event as **\"sending an event\"**. (**as it was before**).\n2) We will deprecate all send event functions across bevy crates in favor of write ones, and will continue to refer to writing an event as **\"writing an event\"**. (There are 10+ internal and public methods that refer to write events as sending, and some that refer as writing, so we will need to rename send ones, hence **more breaking changes**).\n3) What we have right now + this PR (+1/2 commits to fix warnings): we will have **`Events<E>`** and **`EventsWriter`** **write** methods, with **send** ones as obsolete, but still refer in examples, methods and documentation in all bevy crates except **bevy::ecs::event** as **\"sending an event\"**/**send_event**/**sending_system**.  (**deal with inconsistency**, maybe changing it like **writing an event:lower level; sending an event:higher level**)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18966/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
