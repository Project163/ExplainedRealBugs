We should make it even easier.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nImplement `Not` for `Visibility`. Document the behavior of `Visibility::Inherited` (left unchanged) in the doc comment for the impl block.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nConvert to and from a bool using https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/14784. This is likely slower, and much more verbose.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, writing your own match statement is tedious and verbose.\r\n\r\nWe could also (or instead) add a `.toggle` method, and have one variant which converts Inherited -> Hidden, and one which leaves it alone.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14825/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
