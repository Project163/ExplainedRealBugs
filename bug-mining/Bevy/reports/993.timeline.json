Objective\r\n\r\nCurrently implemented JSON Schema export is often producing invalid schemas for types resulting in that json that would be a valid value for schema generated for type cannot be deserialized to that type by Bevy deserializer. \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to reimagine how the schema is constructed. It follows Draft 2020 of JSON schema, as definied here: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema \r\nIt is possible to use schemas generated by new system as validation data for assets in various editors. Once there would be a support for getting information about supported extensions with reflection system I could write example. Related task: #19399 \r\nMain additions and change to previous behaviour would be:\r\n- `f32` generates `{\"type\": \"number\", \"shortPath\": \"f32\", \"typePath\": \"f32\"}` instead of `{\"$ref\": \"#/$defs/f32\"}`\r\n- primitive types also are getting proper support for minimum and maximum values- from type itself and also from reflection range data, if provided.\r\n- `CustomInternalSchemaData` enables providing custom schemas for reflected types\r\n- Particularly useful for types like `Vec3` that serialize as 3-element arrays despite being structs with 3 fields\r\n- `ExternalSchemaSource` trait allows referencing external schema sources\r\n- Automatic registration for math types (Vec2, Vec3, Vec4, quaternions, matrices) to serialize as arrays\r\n- Types with `ReflectDefault` implementation automatically include a `default` field in their schema\r\n- Type and field descriptions are read from documentation attributes and included in schemas\r\n- Range attributes (`#[reflect(@min..=max)]`) are properly handled\r\n- `Option<T>` is now treated as a non required field with possible values of `T` or `null`. This approach ensures compatibility with JSON Schema validation while maintaining type safety. More specific info about whether field is required should be provided by bevy reflection system later on. Related task: #19557 \r\n- New field `rustFieldsInfo`- It is provided when type is serialized as array, but the type is not an array. It is done to provide additional information about the fields in the schema.\r\n\r\nExample schema:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"$schema\": \"https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema\",\r\n

Objective\r\n\r\n- This is another way to fix to #20952\r\n- It also fixes any other user of `TypedReflectDeserializer` that was expecting a concrete type being returned.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Attempt to use the reflected `FromReflect` to produce a concrete type after deserializing a dynamic value.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- I added a slightly modified test from #20981 to demonstrate that this also fixes the issue.
