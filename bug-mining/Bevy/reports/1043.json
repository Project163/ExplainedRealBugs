Default query filters can be ignored by mentioning the type in the query, like `With<Internal>` or `Allows<Internal>`.  But when the filter is added by a required component, the user may not know to mention it!  \n\n```rust\nlet mut world = World::new();\nlet entity = world.spawn(Observer::new(|_: On<Insert>| {})).id();\n\n// This seems like it should work, but does not\nlet mut query = world.query::<&Observer>();\nassert!(query.query(&world).get(entity).is_err());\n\n// This is the workaround, but is hard to discover\nlet mut query = world.query_filtered::<&Observer, Allow<Internal>>();\nassert!(query.query(&world).get(entity).is_ok());\n```\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nWhen a query mentions a component that *requires* a component with a default query filter, that filter should be ignored.
