Objective\r\n\r\n`bevy_pbr/utils.wgsl` shader file contains mathematical constants and color conversion functions. Both of those should be  accessible without enabling `bevy_pbr` feature. For example, tonemapping can be done in non pbr scenario, and it uses color conversion functions. \r\n\r\nFixes #13207\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n* Move mathematical constants (such as PI, E) from `bevy_pbr/src/render/utils.wgsl` into `bevy_render/src/maths.wgsl`\r\n* Move color conversion functions from `bevy_pbr/src/render/utils.wgsl` into new file `bevy_render/src/color_operations.wgsl`\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nRan multiple examples, checked they are working:\r\n* tonemapping\r\n* color_grading\r\n* 3d_scene\r\n* animated_material\r\n* deferred_rendering\r\n* 3d_shapes\r\n* fog\r\n* irradiance_volumes\r\n* meshlet\r\n* parallax_mapping\r\n* pbr\r\n* reflection_probes\r\n* shadow_biases\r\n* 2d_gizmos\r\n* light_gizmos\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n* Moved mathematical constants (such as PI, E) from `bevy_pbr/src/render/utils.wgsl` into `bevy_render/src/maths.wgsl`\r\n* Moved color conversion functions from `bevy_pbr/src/render/utils.wgsl` into new file `bevy_render/src/color_operations.wgsl`\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\nIn user's shader code replace usage of mathematical constants from `bevy_pbr::utils` to the usage of the same constants from `bevy_render::maths`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13209/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12700077864,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86HyQpjzwAAAAL0-88o","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12700077864","actor":{"login":"IceSentry","id":8348954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDg5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8348954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry","html_url":"https://github.com/IceSentry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-03T19:06:04Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Triage","color":"D876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12700077870,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86HyQpjzwAAAAL0-88u","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12700077870","actor":{"login":"IceSentry","id":8348954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDg5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8348954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry","html_url":"https://github.com/IceSentry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-03T19:06:04Z","label":{"name":"A-Rendering","color":"C6A751"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12700078183,"node_id":"MIE_lADODf6-U86HyQpjzwAAAAL0-9Bn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12700078183","actor":{"login":"IceSentry","id":8348954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDg5NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8348954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry","html_url":"https://github.com/IceSentry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IceSentry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-03T19:06:06Z","milestone":{"title":"0.14"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12704132221,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86HyQpjzwAAAAL1Oax9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12704132221","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/us
