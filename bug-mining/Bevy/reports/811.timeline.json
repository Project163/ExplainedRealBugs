Objective\r\n\r\n- Alternative to and builds on top of #16284.\r\n- Fixes #15849.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Rename component `StateScoped` to `DespawnOnExitState`.\r\n- Rename system `clear_state_scoped_entities` to `despawn_entities_on_exit_state`.\r\n- Add `DespawnOnEnterState` and `despawn_entities_on_enter_state` which is the `OnEnter` equivalent.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> Compared to #16284, the main change is that I did the rename in such a way as to keep the terms `OnExit` and `OnEnter` together. In my own game, I was adding `VisibleOnEnterState` and `HiddenOnExitState` and when naming those, I kept the `OnExit` and `OnEnter` together. When I checked #16284 it stood out to me that the naming was a bit awkward. Putting the `State` in the middle and breaking up `OnEnter` and `OnExit` also breaks searching for those terms.\r\n\r\n## Open questions\r\n\r\n1. Should we split `enable_state_scoped_entities` into two functions, one for the `OnEnter` and one for the `OnExit`? I personally have zero need thus far for the `OnEnter` version, so I'd be interested in not having this enabled unless I ask for it.\r\n2. If yes to 1., should we follow my lead in my `Visibility` state components (see below) and name these `app.enable_despawn_entities_on_enter_state()` and `app.enable_despawn_entities_on_exit_state()`, which IMO says what it does on the tin?\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nRan all changed examples.\r\n\r\n## Side note: `VisibleOnEnterState` and `HiddenOnExitState`\r\n\r\nFor reference to anyone else and to help with the open questions, I'm including the code I wrote for controlling entity visibility when a state is entered/exited.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>visibility.rs</summary>\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse bevy_app::prelude::*;\r\nuse bevy_ecs::prelude::*;\r\nuse bevy_reflect::prelude::*;\r\nuse bevy_render::prelude::*;\r\nuse bevy_state::{prelude::*, state::StateTransitionSteps};\r\nuse tracing::*;\r\n\r\npub trait AppExtStates {\r\n    fn enable_visible_entities_on_enter_state<S: States>(&mut self) -> &mut Self;\r\n\r\n    fn enable_hidden_entities_on_exit_state<S: States>(&mut self) -> &mut Self;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl AppExtStates for App {\r\n    fn enable_visible_entities_on_enter_state<S: States>(&mut self) -> &mut Self {\r\n        self.main_mut()\r\n            .enable_visible_entities_on_enter_state::<S>();\r\n        self\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn enable_hidden_entities_on_exit_state<S: States>(&mut self) -> &mut Self {\r\n        self.main_mut().enable_hidden_entities_on_exit_state::<S>();\r\n        self\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl AppExtStates for SubApp {\r\n    fn enable_visible_entities_on_enter_state<S: States>(&mut self) -> &mut Self {\r\n        if !self\r\n            .world()\r\n            .contains_resource::<Events<StateTransitionEvent<S>>>()\r\n        {\r\n            let name = core::any::type_name::<S>();\r\n            warn!(\"Visible entities on enter state are enabled for state `{}`, but the state isn't installed in the app!\", name);\r\n        }\r\n        // We work with [`StateTransition`] in set\r\n        // [`StateTransitionSteps::ExitSchedules`] as opposed to [`OnExit`],\r\n        // because [`OnExit`] only runs for one specific variant of the state.\r\n        self.add_systems(\r\n            StateTransition,\r\n            update_to_visible_on_enter_state::<S>.in_set(StateTransitionSteps::ExitSchedules),\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn enable_hidden_entities_on_exit_state<S: States>(&mut self) -> &mut Self {\r\n        if !self\r\n            .world()\r\n            .contains_resource::<Events<StateTransitionEvent<S>>>()\r\n        {\r\n            let name = core::any::type_name::<S>();\r\n            warn!(\"Hidden entities on exit state are enabled for state `{}`, but the state isn't installed in the app!\", name);\r\n        }\r\n        // We work with [`StateTransition`] in set\r\n        // [`StateTransitionSteps::ExitSchedules`] as opposed to [`OnExit`],\r\n        // because [`OnExit`] only runs for one specific variant of the state.\r\n        self.add_systems(\r\n            StateTransition,\r\n            update_to_hidden_on_exit_state::<S>.in_set(StateTransitionSteps::ExitSchedules),\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Clone, Component, Debug, Reflect)]\r\n#[reflect(Component, Debug)]\r\npub struct VisibleOnEnterState<S: States>(pub S);\r\n\r\n#[derive(Clone, Component, Debug, Reflect)]\r\n#[reflect(Component, Debug)]\r\npub struct HiddenOnExitState<S: States>(pub S);\r\n\r\n/// Makes entities marked with [`VisibleOnEnterState<S>`] visible when the state\r\n/// `S` is entered.\r\npub fn update_to_visible_on_enter_state<S: States>(\r\n    mut transitions: EventReader<StateTransitionEvent<S>>,\r\n    mut query: Query<(&VisibleOnEnterState<S>, &mut Visibility)>,\r\n) {\r\n    // We use the latest event, because state machine internals generate at most\r\n    // 1 transition event (per type) each frame.
