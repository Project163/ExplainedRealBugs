to add a further note to this: `SmallRng` has the same assurances as `StdRng`, as in it is *deterministic* in output but not *portable*. While `StdRng` currently behaves the same on all platforms (for now), `SmallRng` does not. `SmallRng` uses `Xoshiro256plusplus` on 64-bit platforms, but `Xoshiro128plusplus` on 32-bit platforms ([docs reference](https://docs.rs/rand/latest/rand/rngs/struct.SmallRng.html), [source code reference](https://github.com/rust-random/rand/blob/master/src/rngs/small.rs#L13)). So if one uses `SmallRng` and tries to compare output from a 64-bit desktop platform versus WASM on the web (currently wasm32), then they'd find the output to *not be the same*. This is because `rand` makes no assurance on portability for `SmallRng`, and since `StdRng` has the same lack of portability, it cannot be relied upon to be \"stable\" in the future. Hence the point I made above.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2012102313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Bluefinger","id":3116268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTYyNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3116268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bluefinger","html_url":"https://github.com/Bluefinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bluefinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bluefinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bluefinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bluefinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bluefinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bluefinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bluefinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bluefinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bluefinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2012425065","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12613#issuecomment-2012425065","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12613","id":2012425065,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U8538ytp","user":{"login":"TimLeach635","id":4410524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA1MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4410524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimLeach635","html_url":"https://github.com/TimLeach635","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimLeach635/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimLeach635/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimLeach635/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimLeach635/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimLeach635/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimLeach635/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimLeach635/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimLeach635/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimLeach635/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-21T14:20:35Z","updated_at":"2024-03-21T14:20:35Z","body":"I
