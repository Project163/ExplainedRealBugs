Conversions between `Vec3` and `Dir3` are annoying for end-users, and some of our other APIs provide `Dir3`, while doing mathematics 'by hand' often results in a `Vec3`, so simultaneously capturing these would be nice.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion on Discord, it appears that using `impl TryInto<Dir3>` would be natural for these cases, since they\r\n1. treat their input essentially as a direction even though it's a vector\r\n2. already provide replacement input in the case that the conversion `Vec3 -> Dir3` would fail\r\n\r\nThus, in particular, changing these inputs from `Vec3` to `impl TryInto<Dir3>` is not even a breaking change, but it would allow `Dir3` input to be given just as easily as `Vec3`.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nUsers can manually convert between `Vec3` and `Dir3` to get around this.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nOn the level of API design, just using `Dir3` was considered for `Transform::align` because it is more \"natural\", but providing a `Dir3` is often not ergonomic (especially since the `Vec3` conversion is fallible) and because `Transform::look_to` used `Vec3` already. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12481/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
