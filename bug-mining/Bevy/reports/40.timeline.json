Follow up to #10588 \r\n> Closes #11749 (Supersedes #11756)\r\n\r\nEnable Texture slicing for the following UI nodes:\r\n- `ImageBundle`\r\n- `ButtonBundle`\r\n\r\n<img width=\"739\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 13 57 43\" src=\"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/26703856/37675681-74eb-4689-ab42-024310cf3134\">\r\n\r\nI also added a collection of `fantazy-ui-borders` from [Kenney's](www.kenney.nl) assets, with the appropriate license (CC).\r\nIf it's a problem I can use the same textures as the `sprite_slice` example\r\n\r\n# Work done\r\n\r\nAdded the `ImageScaleMode` component to the targetted bundles, most of the logic is directly reused from `bevy_sprite`.\r\nThe only additional internal component is the UI specific `ComputedSlices`, which does the same thing as its spritee equivalent but adapted to UI code.\r\n\r\nAgain the slicing is not compatible with `TextureAtlas`, it's something I need to tackle more deeply in the future\r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n\r\n* [x] I noticed that `TextureSlicer::compute_slices` could infinitely loop if the border was larger that the image half extents, now an error is triggered and the texture will fallback to being stretched\r\n* [x] I noticed that when using small textures with very small *tiling* options we could generate hundred of thousands of slices. Now I set a minimum size of 1 pixel per slice, which is already ridiculously small, and a warning will be sent at runtime when slice count goes above 1000\r\n* [x] Sprite slicing with `flip_x` or `flip_y` would give incorrect results, correct flipping is now supported to both sprites and ui image nodes thanks to @odecay observation\r\n\r\n# GPU Alternative\r\n\r\nI create a separate branch attempting to implementing 9 slicing and tiling directly through the `ui.wgsl` fragment shader. It works but requires sending more data to the GPU:\r\n- slice border\r\n- tiling factors\r\n\r\nAnd more importantly, the actual quad *scale* which is hard to put in the shader with the current code, so that would be for a  later iteration","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11600/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11600/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11737379221,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U85-d_5VzwAAAAK7mjGV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11737379221","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ab16f5ed6afad717896c278381a0692531eedf44","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/ab16f5ed6afad717896c278381a0692531eedf44","created_at":"2024-02-07T20:24:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11737379591,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U85-d_5VzwAAAAK7mjMH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11737379591","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-07T20:24:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
