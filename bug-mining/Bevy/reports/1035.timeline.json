Objective\r\n\r\nImplements scaffolding for a 2D pan camera controller.\r\n\r\nFixes #21468 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Introduced a `PanCam` component with settings for panning, zooming, and rotation via keyboard input, following the design of the existing `FreeCam`.\r\n- Added a `PanCamPlugin` to register the controller system.\r\n- Implemented keyboard-based panning and rotation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODOs\r\n\r\n- Movement is currently world-axis aligned. \r\n  - TODO: Consider movement relative to camera rotation.\r\n- Zooming support is scaffolded with config fields but not yet implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I was unable to fully test this implementation due to issues running graphical output with GPU acceleration under WSL.  \r\nAs a result, zoom behavior and rotation effects remain TODOs, and the whole code could not be fully verified.\r\n\r\nOnce I resolve the GPU passthrough issues, I plan to complete and test the remaining features (with a more meaningful example).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm happy to hear any suggestions or feedback in the meantime!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21520/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20329600052,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U87QbEDAzwAAAAS7vRQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20329600052","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"81d9c8895029d31c39a637eefef20ca80f2fd18c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/81d9c8895029d31c39a637eefef20ca80f2fd18c","created_at":"2025-10-16T22:00:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20329600335,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U87QbEDAzwAAAAS7vRVP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20329600335","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-16T22:00:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20442202084,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U87QbEDAzwAAAATCcz_k","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20442202084","actor":{"login":"mate-h","id":14351670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzUxNjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14351670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h","html_url":"https://github.com/mate-h","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6aa688ee0c146474ffe5623ab905344fc867d00b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mate-h/bevy/commits/6aa688ee0c146474ffe5623ab905344fc867d00b","created_at":"2025-10-22T23:42:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
