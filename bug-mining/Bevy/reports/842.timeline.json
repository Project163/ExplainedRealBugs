off, thanks for doing this! Using this has fixed the flakiness I was experiencing with the script not always being ready.\n\n1. When reading the docs for `progress()` it says:\n\n> returns a number between 0 and 100.0 to represent the current script pipeline progress,\n\nBut that seems odd to me. A value of `100.0` means \"100 percent loaded\" but that is a UI concern. If anything, I feel this should return progress as a float between 0.0 and 1.0.\n\n2. `num_loaded_scripts()` should arguably be named `loaded_script_count()` and `num_processing_scripts()` -> `processing_script_count()`. See my argument/rationale from an issue in Bevy: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19780#issuecomment-2994554024. It's not an objective choice, but take a look anyway.\n\n3. `processing_batch_completed()` should arguably be named `is_processing_batch_completed()`. You can follow breadcrumbs here https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19110 but tl;dr; is that most Rust functions seem to use this format.\n\n4. Thinking about `progress()` and my comments in 1., I wonder if you should actually just remove it entirely. Users can already get all the data by calling `num_loaded_scripts()` and `num_processing_scripts()` and I personally wouldn't ever need to know the percent progress: just whether or not it's done. That is, it really feels more like a UI concern. Up to you though!\n\n5. Regarding the use of the term `batch` in `processing_batch_completed()`, what is the purpose? As a user, I don't feel like I really know anything about batches here so it was confusing to me looking at this method name and wondering if it's what I want. If it was just `processing_completed()` (read: `is_processing_completed()`), would that lose any information?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/issues/495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/makspll/bevy_mod_scripting/issues/495/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
