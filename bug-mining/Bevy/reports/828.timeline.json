Objective\r\n\r\n- Add a `--debug` flag to `build-wasm-example` to support debug builds for WebGL2/WebGPU targets.\r\n- Fixes #18464\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- Added `--debug` flag to build Wasm examples in debug mode.\r\n- Default remains release mode if `--debug` is not specified.\r\n- Updated documentation to describe the new flag and usage.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Verified debug and release builds

Release: `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/examples/`\r\n- Confirmed wasm-bindgen output is written to: `examples/wasm/target/debug` , `examples/wasm/target/release`\r\n- Haven't actually tested

Objective\r\n\r\n- Add a `--debug` flag to `build-wasm-example` to support debug builds for WebGL2/WebGPU targets.\r\n- Fixes #18464\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- Added `--debug` flag to build Wasm examples in debug mode.\r\n- Default remains release mode if `--debug` is not specified.\r\n- Updated documentation to describe the new flag and usage.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Verified debug and release builds for WebGL2 and WebGPU respectively.\r\n- Confirmed wasm artifacts are placed in the correct target dir for each build profile:\r\n  - Debug: `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/examples/`\r\n  - Release: `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/examples/`\r\n- Confirmed wasm-bindgen output is written to: `examples/wasm/target/debug` , `examples/wasm/target/release`\r\n- Haven't actually tested
