`Text`, and `Handle<MeshletMesh>` were types of renderable entities that the new segregated visible entity system didn't handle, so they didn't appear.\r\n\r\nBecause `bevy_text` depends on `bevy_sprite`, and the visibility computation of text happens in the latter crate, I had to introduce a new marker component, `SpriteSource`. `SpriteSource` marks entities that aren't themselves sprites but become sprites during rendering. I added this component to `Text2dBundle`. Unfortunately, this is technically a breaking change, although I suspect it won't break anybody in practice except perhaps editors.\r\n\r\nFixes #12935.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n* `Text2dBundle` now includes a new marker component, `SpriteSource`. Bevy uses this internally to optimize visibility calculation.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n* `Text` now requires a `SpriteSource` marker component in order to appear. This component has been added to `Text2dBundle`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12945/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12458121334,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86FdB4KzwAAAALmj9h2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12458121334","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8577a448f72d83593c544f5725a8bf57fef68ba9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/8577a448f72d83593c544f5725a8bf57fef68ba9","created_at":"2024-04-13T14:29:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12458121353,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86FdB4KzwAAAALmj9iJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12458121353","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-13T14:29:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
