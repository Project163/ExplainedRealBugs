This can be added to `.cargo/config.toml`.\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[alias]\r\nci = \"run --package ci --\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are a few issues with this. `config.toml` is currently `.gitignore`-d because we encourage developers to configure their own, faster linkers. By adding the `[alias]` table for everyone, we would have to remove `config.toml` from `.gitignore`, making every local modification to it visible in Git's staged changes.\r\n\r\nEven if we had a `config.toml` with just the `[alias]` table and `config_fast_builds.toml` separate, it would still run into the same issue because developers would have to copy the contents of `config_fast_builds.toml` over, thus showing up in Git.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to solve this, so I'm creating an issue for it. I think if it were possible [to merge multiple `config.toml`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#hierarchical-structure) files, this would be perfect, but I can't think of anything right now.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\n- Add this directly to `config_fast_builds.toml`, so you must opt-in to use the alias.\r\n- Do not implement this feature.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n- Inspired by [`cargo-xtask`](https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask).\r\n- [Example usage](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/54d8815d04fa3816edc207bbc4dd36bf18014dbc/.cargo/config.toml#L2-L4), in Cargo itself.\r\n- [Reference documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#alias) for `[alias]`.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13197/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13197/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
