My code looked approximately like:\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut anim_player = AnimationPlayer::default();\r\nlet mut transitions = AnimationTransitions::new();\r\n\r\ntransitions\r\n    .play(&mut anim_player, idle_animation, Duration::ZERO)\r\n    .repeat();\r\n\r\ncommands\r\n    .spawn((\r\n        SceneBundle {\r\n            scene: my_entity_gltf_scene.clone(),\r\n            ..default()\r\n        },\r\n        anim_player,\r\n        transitions,\r\n        my_anim_graph.clone(),\r\n    ));\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this is wrong because here I'm creating my own `AnimationPlayer`, when I should actually be using the player created by the scene when it's instantiated. What I actually have to do is spawn the SceneBundle in one system, wait for the scene to be instantiated, and use a second system to use the automatically-created `AnimationPlayer` (I assume because the scene automatically populates it with some important data?). It's not really documented that this is specifically how you're meant to do this.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14852/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
