Bevy version\n\n0.15.0\n\n## What you did\n\nI am using Image and TextureFormatPixelInfo from bevy_image (respective bevy::image) and I want to only include only the relevant bevy parts by depending on bevy and setting deafult-features=false. rust-analyzer is suggesting the following import `bevy::image::Image`, but I get this error message when building:\n```\nerror[E0432]: unresolved import `bevy::image`\n  --> src/asset_loader.rs:11:5\n   |\n11 |     image::{Image, TextureFormatPixelInfo},\n   |     ^^^^^ could not find `image` in `bevy`\n\nFor more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0432`.\nerror: could not compile `bevy_titan` (lib) due to 1 previous error\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\nI am not sure. There is no bevy_image feature, but I would have expected bevy_sprite (which is a feature I enable) to pull in bevy_image (and obviously I can still functionally use Image, just not directly because I can not import it).\nSee https://github.com/KirmesBude/bevy_titan/commit/4c6477507261f9f4a746dbe030e648b3fea85576 for my specific reproducible issue.\n\nWorkaround: Enable any image feature e.g. \"png\"","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16563/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16563/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
