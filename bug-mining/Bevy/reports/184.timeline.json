How can Bevy's documentation be improved?\r\n\r\nSince #10702, [`ReceivedCharacter`] now contains [`SmolStr`], which is a bit confusing. Is it a character or multiple characters?\r\n\r\nThe [winit docs] for the underlying winit event that populates this have some info about why it is not a `char` and what else might be in there. (but surely this isn't a `str` just for stray deadkeys, right? we should look into what locales or settings or whatever would produce multiple `chars`.)\r\n\r\n`ReceivedCharacter` is also not consistent cross-platform in other important ways. See https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/3381.\r\n\r\nWe might also want to point users to an alternative: [`KeyEvent::logical_key`] which is more consistent across platforms and is in a unified event stream with other keyboard events, which is important if you are developing a text input.\r\n\r\n[winit docs]: https://docs.rs/winit/0.29.10/winit/event/struct.KeyEvent.html#structfield.text\r\n[`SmolStr`]: https://docs.rs/smol_str/0.2.1/smol_str/struct.SmolStr.html\r\n[`ReceivedCharacter`]: https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/prelude/struct.ReceivedCharacter.html\r\n[`KeyEvent::logical_key`]: https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/input/keyboard/struct.KeyboardInput.html#structfield.logical_key\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12040/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"chompaa","id":26204416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjA0NDE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26204416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa","html_url":"https://github.com/chompaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-03T22:56:46Z","updated_at":"2024-04-03T22:56:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12868","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12868/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12868/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12868/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12868","id":2224081123,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U85roWJ3","number":12868,"title":"Deprecate `ReceivedCharacter`","user":{"login":"chompaa","id":26204416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjA0NDE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26204416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa","html_url":"https://github.com/chompaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2272055247,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjcyMDU1MjQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-Input","name":"A-Input","color":"C6A751","default":false,"description":"Player input via keyboard, mouse, gamepad, and more"},{"id":2272055811,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjcyMDU1ODEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-Windowing","name":"A-Windowing","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Platform-agnostic interface layer to run your app in"},{"id":2287994822,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjg3OTk0ODIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Code-Quality","name":"C-Code-Quality","color":"B8B8B8","default":false,"description":"A section of code that is hard to understand or change"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #12639.\r\n- `ReceivedCharacter` was deprecated in #12868 for 0.14, and should be removed for 0.15.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Remove all instances of `ReceivedCharacter`, including the relevant `#[allow(deprecated)]` lint attributes.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n`ReceivedCharacter` was deprecated in 0.14 due to `winit` reworking their keyboard system. It has now been fully removed. Switch to using `KeyboardInput` instead.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// 0.14\r\nfn listen_characters(events: EventReader<ReceivedCharacter>) {\r\n    for event in events.read() {\r\n        info!(\"{}\", event.char);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// 0.15\r\nfn listen_characters(events: EventReader<KeyboardInput>) {\r\n    for event in events.read() {\r\n        // Only check for characters when the key is pressed.\r\n        if !event.state.is_pressed() {\r\n            continue;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Note that some keys such as `Space` and `Tab` won't be detected as a character.\r\n        // Instead, check for them as separate enum variants.\r\n        match &event.logical_key {\r\n            Key::Character(character) => {\r\n                info!(\"{} pressed.\", character);\r\n            },\r\n            Key::Space => {\r\n                info!(\"Space pressed.\");\r\n            },\r\n            _ => {},\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14190981141,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86DOKTKzwAAAANN2TAV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14190981141","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"74ccab947dc12ee49f5bccab6eb17bbdad7b8178","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/74ccab947dc12ee49f5bccab6eb17bbdad7b8178","created_at":"2024-09-10T00:37:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
