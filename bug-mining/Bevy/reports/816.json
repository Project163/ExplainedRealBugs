Bevy version\r\n\r\n`0.14.0`\r\n\r\n## Relevant system information\r\n\r\n- `rustc --version`: `rustc 1.81.0-nightly (6292b2af6 2024-07-02)`\r\n- Running Windows 11\r\n```ignore\r\n`AdapterInfo { name: \"NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti\", vendor: 4318, device: 6918, device_type: DiscreteGpu, driver: \"NVIDIA\", driver_info: \"555.99\", backend: Vulkan }`\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What you did\r\n\r\nThere's a minimal reproduction here: https://github.com/janhohenheim/asset-crash\r\n\r\nThe relevant code is just this `main.rs`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse bevy::{asset::embedded_asset, prelude::*};\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let mut app = App::new();\r\n    app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins);\r\n    embedded_asset!(app, \"splash.png\");\r\n    app.run();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe setup is:\r\n- crate\r\n  - src/\r\n\t  - `main.rs`\r\n\t  - `splash.png`\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\nRunning this with `cargo run` works.\r\nRunning it on Wasm on Windows instead gives me:\r\n```\r\nFailed to find src_prefix \"src\" in \"src\\\\screen\\\\splash\\\\mod.rs\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the part of the Bevy code that panics: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/crates/bevy_asset/src/io/embedded/mod.rs#L141\r\nAnd this is the PR that introduced it: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10383\r\n\r\nNote that this is *not* reproducible on Linux\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nThe minimal example has a workaround. Move `crate/src/splash.png` into `crate/assets/splash.png` and embed it with `embedded_asset!(app, \"../assets/splash.png\");`.\r\nFor reasons unknown to me, doing the same workaround on https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/bevy-template does *not* work.\r\n\r\nI also tried running the [embedded assets example](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/asset/embedded_asset.rs) with `cargo build --example ...` and that one works.\r\n\r\nUsing `load_internal_binary_asset` like this works as well:\r\n```rust\r\n    load_internal_binary_asset!(\r\n        app,\r\n        SPLASH_IMAGE_HANDLE,\r\n        \"splash.png\",\r\n        |bytes, _path: String| {\r\n            Image::from_buffer(\r\n                bytes,\r\n                ImageType::Extension(\"png\"),\r\n                default(),\r\n                true,\r\n                ImageSampler::linear(),\r\n                RenderAssetUsages::RENDER_WORLD | RenderAssetUsages::MAIN_WORLD,\r\n            )\r\n            .unwrap()\r\n        }\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"superdump","id":302146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump","html_url":"https://github.com/superdump","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14246/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
