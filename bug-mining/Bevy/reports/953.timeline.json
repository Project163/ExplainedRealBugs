almost fixed the issue described in #20834.\n\nThere's still a problem in the corner case where the parent is `Text` (not `Text2d`) and uses an empty string. Then the first child will use the color of the parent instead of its own.  The other children use their own color as expected.\n\nCode sample to reproduce:\n\n```rust\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut app = App::new();\n    app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_systems(Startup, spawn_text)\n        .run();\n}\n\nfn spawn_text(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn(Camera2d);\n\n    commands.spawn((\n        Text::default(),\n        children![\n            (TextSpan::new(\"red\"), TextColor(Srgba::RED.into())),\n            (TextSpan::new(\"green\"), TextColor(Srgba::GREEN.into())),\n            (TextSpan::new(\"blue\"), TextColor(Srgba::BLUE.into()))\n        ],\n    ));\n}\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20854/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
