Objective\r\n\r\nFix the misleading 2d anchor API where `Anchor` is a component and required by `Text2d` but is stored on a field for sprites. \r\n\r\nFixes #18367\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nRemove the `anchor` field from `Sprite` and require `Anchor` instead.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThe `anchor` field has been removed from `Sprite`. Instead the `Anchor` component is now a required component on `Sprite`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18393/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17756714879,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86uaVO4zwAAAAQiYfd_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17756714879","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2b59ab8e2da6cb21e9d29a9201f28944a510d9ad","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/2b59ab8e2da6cb21e9d29a9201f28944a510d9ad","created_at":"2025-05-21T15:53:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17756715103,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86uaVO4zwAAAAQiYfhf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17756715103","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-21T15:53:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
