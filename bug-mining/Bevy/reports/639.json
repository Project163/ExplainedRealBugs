However, this very quickly loses value on the systems that depend on a combination of components including the provided component type. Compounding `any_with_component` doesn't address this as it doesn't look at archetypes like a filter does.\n\nTake the following system for example:\n\n```\nfn update(mut enemies: Query<(&EnemyMovement, &mut Transform)>, time: Res<Time>) {\n    for (movement, mut transform) in enemies.iter_mut() {\n        transform.translation.y -= time.delta_secs() * movement.speed;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis is a very basic system, but the built-in run conditions do not provide means to limit the scheduling of this system. If I were to use `any_with_component::<EnemyMovement>`, this system will still run if there are `EnemyMovement` components that exist without `Transform`, and therefore time would be wasted scheduling this system for execution in that frame. Instead, I've used the suggested condition:\n\n```\napp.add_systems(\n  Update,\n  update.run_if(any_for_filter::<(With<EnemyMovement>, With<Transform>)>),\n);\n```\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nI'm using this in every project in order to appropriately limit my scheduled systems:\n\n```\npub fn any_for_filter<F: QueryFilter>(entities: Query<(), F>) -> bool {\n    !entities.is_empty()\n}\n```\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nNo alternatives.\n\n## Additional context\n\nN/A\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17326/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
