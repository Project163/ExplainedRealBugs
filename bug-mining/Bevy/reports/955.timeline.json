brought this up on discord a while back, cart's comment was \"desktop_app needs some love\".\n\nThe parts that are missing in the screenshot are the entities that are rendered using a custom shader (in this case, the color gradient shader that @ickshonpe wrote). The issue is that compiling the shader isn't instant, but `desktop_app` doesn't know this. What would have to happen is that a \"render request\" event gets posted when the shader compilation completes.\n\nThe problem with that solution, though, it that it only addresses one narrow case, shaders, when in fact there's lots of async stuff that goes on in Bevy, and all of it potentially needs to request a new frame. What I don't know is whether or not there's a small number of chokepoints where you could do this instead of scattering the requests all over the code base.\n\nTo be honest I don't know how desktop_app can even work: I know that it prevents the renderer from running, but what else does it prevent? Does it inhibit all ECS code from running? If that's the case, then does that mean that even things like asset loading are paused until the user wiggles the mouse? Does the shader compilation get halted as well? In that case, posting a frame request on completion would do no good, because completion never comes.\n\nAt the same time, my intent in choosing the desktop app in the example was specifically to surface lurking problems like this one, to hopefully add a forcing function for supporting it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3243332072/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"viridia","id":1166135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia","html_url":"https://github.com/viridia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19448440735,"node_id":"MEE_lADODf6-U87Iy9tpzwAAAASHN6ef","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19448440735","actor":{"login":"ickshonpe","id":27962798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTYyNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27962798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe","html_url":"https://github.com/ickshonpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-01T22:28:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19448440745,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U87Iy9tpzwAAAASHN6ep","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19448440745","actor":{"login":"ickshonpe","id":27962798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTYyNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27962798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe","html_url":"https://github.com/ickshonpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-01T22:28:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3243460747","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20796#issuecomment-3243460747","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20796","id":3243460747,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U87BU0iL","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-02T00:36:11Z","updated

That allows background tasks like shader and asset loading to be started, which would continue in the background but are not polled until the app wakes up again.\n\nIn order to do \"run an update frame when assets are loaded\", you'd need to have a polling mechanism that lives outside of the ECS completely, which then sends a wake signal. Very messy! You could create some centralized mechanism to register it but ultimately it feels like this is a problem with how `desktop_app` is driving our event loop.\n\nMy first thought is that when it's paused, we should continue to call `App::update` on a slow timer, but only run a single schedule, used for polling things like tasks, and then we send a wake event from within that schedule. All of our await / async polling would be moved to there by convention.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3243460747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3243483161","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20796#issuecomment-3243483161","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20796","id":3243483161,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U87BU6AZ","user":{"login":"viridia","id":1166135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia","html_url":"https://github.com/viridia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-02T00:58:29Z","updated_at":"2025-09-02T00:58:29Z","body":"Possibly

for instance, a file-loading task on Windows could expose an event HANDLE, allowing the event loop to gather up these handles and pass them to WaitForMultipleObjects.\n\nThis is just an early idea, I'm not that familiar with bevy's internals.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3246393962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"beholdnec","id":9994394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTQzOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9994394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beholdnec","html_url":"https://github.com/beholdnec","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beholdnec/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beholdnec/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beholdnec/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beholdnec/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beholdnec/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beholdnec/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beholdnec/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beholdnec/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beholdnec/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-03T17:43:47Z","updated_at":"2025-09-03T17:43:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20851","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20851/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20851/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20851/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/20851","id":3380715607,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86msp-X","number":20851,"title":"Remove `desktop_app` setting from `feathers` example (and other UI examples)","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2272053786,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjcyMDUzNzg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Examples","name":"C-Examples","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"An addition or correction to our examples"},{"id":2276469463,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjc2NDY5NDYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-UI","name":"A-UI","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Graphical user interfaces, styles, layouts, and widgets"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Objective\r\n\r\nWhile `desktop_app` is arguably correct for a UI focused example, in practice, it doesn't work well currently. The intermittent updates lead to \"buggy\" behavior: partial loads, stutters and so on.\r\n\r\nWe should fix those problems, and make the desktop_app setting more useful! But \"last minute before release\" is not a good time to do so. And simply leaving these apparent bugs in our showcase of the new UI toolkit will both mislead users about the quality and trick them into doing bad things for their own project.\r\n\r\nCloses #20796. Fixes (kind of) the problem that motivated #20849.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nRemove the `desktop_app` setting from this example.\r\n\r\nThis will cause problems for `accesskit` users (at least on Mac) unfortunately, but that problem is *another* bug: #20515. Telling visually impaired users that they can only use screen readers on low CPU utilization apps in our game framework is not acceptable either.\r\n\r\nI've also removed this from the other UI examples for the same reasons. The `low_power` example exists to demonstrate this: we shouldn't clutter the others without good justification.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI've run the `feathers` example locally: the bad behavior is no longer observed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20851/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20851/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19491072094,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U87Iy9tpzwAAAASJwihe","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19491072094","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"799f14c3562e6c20cdfbbc73551e19ebb38c2730","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/799f14c3562e6c20cdfbbc73551e19ebb38c2730","created_at":"2025-09-03T21:19:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19491072389,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U87Iy9tpzwAAAASJwimF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19491072389","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-03T21:19:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-04T23:15:29Z","updated_at":"2025-09-04T23:15:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20873","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20873/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20873/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20873/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20873","id":3385778487,"node_id":"I_kwDODf6-U87JzuE3","number":20873,"title":"`bevy_assets`

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nWhen running in `desktop_app` mode, applications can get \"stuck\" in an unloaded or partially loaded state.\n\nThis leads to bugs like #20796.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nThe `AssetServer` should send wake events whenever assets are finished loading, if we're running in a mode like `desktop_app`. That's pretty hand-wavey, so there's more digging to do before we can implement this.\n\nThis is quite hard to do though: the `App` code is fully paused without user inputs. Somehow, we need to be regularly and efficiently polling even when the app is asleep. Apparently `egui` / `bevy_egui` do a better job of this (thanks @aevyrie), so looking there for prior art would be wise.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nDon't use `desktop_app`, as we did in #20851 as a workaround. This isn't viable in the long-term though: input-driven windowing provides better responsivity and power efficiency.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20873/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
