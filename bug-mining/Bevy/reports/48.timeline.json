after reverting #10644 and adding a reflect_value impl to `wgpu::TextureUsages` in `bevy_reflect`, deriving Reflect on CameraMainTextureUsages, and registering the type, we're back in

PartialEq));\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/2694663/a4ebfdbd-e552-4197-94fc-666355f9cfb2)\r\n\r\nIt is broken for serialization scenarios (as TextureUsages is not serializable). But it fixes GLTF loading. I'm going to see if we can do the same reflect_value hack for #10644 to avoid needing to revert (but note that us moving away from strings for this will break serialization for that as well).\r\n\r\nThe TextureUsages serialization can be fixed by moving to the Image mirror types we'll be adding here: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11294#issuecomment-1928552369\r\n\r\n> Should we just enforce labels to derive reflect and then we reflect them via their path?\r\n\r\nThe interned RenderGraph label serialization will be its own can of worms as we've moved to using types as identifiers. We'd likely need some type of TypePath -> label object registry for this. My new scene system would accommodate this type of exchange by supporting constructing the runtime types from different types in the scene, with access to a World context.

Objective\r\n\r\nThe new render graph labels do not (and cannot) implement normal Reflect, which breaks spawning scenes with cameras (including GLTF scenes). Likewise, the new `CameraMainTextureUsages` also does not (and cannot) implement normal Reflect because it uses `wgpu::TextureUsages` under the hood.\r\n\r\nFixes #11852\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis implements minimal \"reflect value\" for `CameraRenderGraph` and `CameraMainTextureUsages` and registers the types, which satisfies our spawn logic.\r\n\r\nNote that this _does not_ fix scene serialization for these types, which will require more significant changes. We will especially need to think about how (and if) \"interned labels\" will fit into the scene system. For the purposes of 0.13, I think this is the best we can do. Given that this serialization issue is prevalent throughout Bevy atm, I'm ok with adding a couple more to the pile. When we roll out the new scene system, we will be forced to solve these on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Implement Reflect (value) for `CameraMainTextureUsages` and `CameraRenderGraph`, and register those types.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11878/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11822453787,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U85_I0mYzwAAAALArFQb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11822453787","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fe777d5c3fba64bec250b8ced3a6ba98fbd07a64","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/fe777d5c3fba64bec250b8ced3a6ba98fbd07a64","created_at":"2024-02-15T23:56:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11822531522,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U85_I0mYzwAAAALArYPC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11822531522","actor":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-16T00:08:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-16T18:27:44Z","updated_at":"2024-02-16T18:27:44Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11905","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11905/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11905/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11905/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11905","id":2139158934,"node_id":"I_kwDODf6-U85_gPmW","number":11905,"title":"`scene_viewer`
