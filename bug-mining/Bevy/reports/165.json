I ran into this with `TextBundle`, but I'm sure there's more.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nDerive `Clone` on all of Bevy's bundle types where possible. Add trivial `Clone` impls to all contained components.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nThis can be worked around by implementing a custom bundle type which either mirrors or embeds Bevy's bundle types, and implementing Clone on that.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n#1515 covers a feature request to clone arbitrary entities, once they exist. This feature request is distinct but related: rather than cloning entities dynamically, we simply want to clone the set of data used to generate them.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12985/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
