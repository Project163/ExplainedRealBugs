is largely identical to #20934, except we store resource data on a `ResourceComponent<R: Resource>` component on a singleton entity. This has the benefit of sidestepping the annoying double-derive problem of having to both derive `Component` and `Resource` for each resource.\r\n\r\nFor more information check out the original PR description #20934.\r\n\r\nCloses #20934, #19711, #17485 and is part of #19731.\r\n\r\n# Other Changes\r\n\r\n## Deprecate `Components` methods\r\n\r\nThis PR deprecates `Components::get_valid_resource_id(type_id: TypeId)`, and `Components::get_resource_id(type_id: TypeId)`. This is because resources (excluding non-send) are not registered with their `TypeId` anymore. Instead they're registered by the `TypeId` of `ResourceComponent<SomeResource>`. This changes the API as follows:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nworld.components().get_resource_id(TypeId::of::<SomeResource>())\r\n```\r\nbecomes\r\n```rust\r\nworld.components().get_resource_id(TypeId::of::<ResourceComponent<SomeResource>>())\r\n```\r\nThis becomes confusing, as the method name suggests we're dealing with resources, while in order to use it correctly, we must already be aware that resources are actually hidden behind a component. The same is true for the `get_valid_resource_id` method. Both are being deprecated in favour of either `resource_id` and `valid_resource_id` for when the type is available, or `get_id` or `get_valid_id` when it isn't. Using the latter two does require the user to wrap the type in `ResourceComponent<_>` in order for it to work correctly.\r\n\r\n## Registering a Resource Type\r\n\r\nWhen registering a resource type manually through `app.register_type::<R>()` or through the `AppTypeRegistry`, a user must wrap the type in `ResourceComponent<R>` in order for it to be properly registered. \r\n\r\nHowever, when using the untyped API's like `get_resource_by_id`, the user can simply `read::<R>()` since `ResourceComponent<_>` is transparent.\r\n\r\n## Resources implement `MapEntities` by default\r\n\r\nIn order to have `MapEntities` working with resources, `#[derive(Resource)]` now automatically implements `MapEntities`. This makes it such that\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Resource, MapEntities)]\r\nstruct Foo {\r\n    #[entities]\r\n    entity_a: Entity\r\n}\r\n```\r\nno longer compiles. Instead write:\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Resource)]\r\nstruct Foo {\r\n    #[entities]\r\n    entity_a: Entity\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21346/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20085436872,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U87PgPjBzwAAAAStL3HI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20085436872","actor":{"login":"hukasu","id":7583440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1ODM0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7583440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu","html_url":"https://github.com/hukasu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-03T16:33:49Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Triage","color":"D876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20085436883,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U87PgPjBzwAAAAStL3HT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20085436883","actor":{"login":"hukasu","id":7583440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1ODM0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7583440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu","html_url":"https://github.com/hukasu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hukasu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-03T16:33:49Z","label":{"name":"S-Ready-For-Implementation","color":"D876E3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"chescock","id":8494645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0OTQ2NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8494645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock","html_url":"https://github.com/chescock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-22T14:11:56Z","updated_at":"2025-10-22T14:11:56Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21623","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21623/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21623/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21623/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/21623","id":3537691317,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86u52ka","number":21623,"title":"Remove

is part of #19731.\r\n\r\n# Resources as Components\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nMore things should be entities. This simplifies the API, the lower-level implementation and the tools we have for entities and components can be used for other things in the engine. In particular, for resources, it is really handy to have observers, which we currently don't have. See #20821 under 1A, for a more specific use.\r\n\r\n## Current Work\r\n\r\nThis removes the `resources` field from the world storage and instead store the resources on singleton entities. For easy lookup, we add a `HashMap<ComponentId, Entity>` to `World`, in order to quickly find the singleton entity where the resource is stored.\r\n\r\nBecause we store resources on entities, we derive `Component` alongside `Resource`, this means that\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Resource)]\r\nstruct Foo;\r\n```\r\nturns into\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Resource, Component)]\r\nstruct Foo;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was also done for reflections, meaning that\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Resource, Reflect)]\r\n#[refect(Resource)]\r\nstruct Bar;\r\n```\r\nbecomes\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Resource, Component, Reflect)]\r\n#[refect(Resource, Component)]\r\nstruct Bar;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to distinguish resource entities, they are tagged with the `IsResource` component. Additionally, to ensure that they aren't queried by accident, they are also tagged as being internal entities, which means that they don't show up in queries by default.\r\n\r\n## Drawbacks\r\n\r\n- Currently you can't have a struct that is both a `Resource` and a `Component`, because `Resource` expands to also implement `Component`, this means that this throws a compiler error as it's implemented twice.\r\n- Because every reflected Resource must also implement `ReflectComponent` you need to import `bevy_ecs::reflect::ReflectComponent` every time you use `#[reflect(Resource)]`. This is kind of unintuitive.\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\n\r\n- Simplify `Access` in the ECS, to only deal with components (and not components *and* resources).\r\n- Newtype `Res<Resource>` to `Single<Ref<Resource>>` (or something similair).\r\n- Eliminate `ReflectResource`.\r\n- Take stabs at simplifying the public facing API.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20934/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20934/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
