adds support for one-to-many non-fragmenting relationships (with planned paths for fragmenting and non-fragmenting many-to-many relationships). \"Non-fragmenting\" means that entities with the same relationship type, but different relationship targets, are not forced into separate tables (which would cause \"table fragmentation\").\r\n\r\nFunctionally, this fills a similar niche as the current Parent/Children system. The biggest differences are:\r\n\r\n1. Relationships have simpler internals and significantly improved performance and UX. Commands and specialized APIs are no longer necessary to keep everything in sync. Just spawn entities with the relationship components you want and everything \"just works\".\r\n2. Relationships are generalized. Bevy can provide additional built in relationships, and users can define their own.\r\n\r\n**REQUEST TO REVIEWERS**: _please don't leave top level comments and instead comment on specific lines of code. That way we can take advantage of threaded discussions. Also dont leave comments simply pointing out CI failures as I can read those just fine._\r\n\r\n## Built on top of what we have\r\n\r\nRelationships are implemented on top of the Bevy ECS features we already have: components, immutability, and hooks. This makes them immediately compatible with all of our existing (and future) APIs for querying, spawning, removing, scenes, reflection, etc. The fewer specialized APIs we need to build, maintain, and teach, the better.\r\n\r\n## Why focus on one-to-many non-fragmenting first?\r\n\r\n1. This allows us to improve Parent/Children relationships immediately, in a way that is reasonably uncontroversial. Switching our hierarchy to fragmenting relationships would have significant performance implications. ~~Flecs is heavily considering a switch to non-fragmenting relations after careful considerations of the performance tradeoffs.~~ _(Correction from @SanderMertens: Flecs is implementing non-fragmenting storage specialized for asset hierarchies, where asset hierarchies are many instances of small trees that have a well defined structure)_\r\n2. Adding generalized one-to-many relationships is currently a priority for the [Next Generation Scene / UI effort](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/14437). Specifically, we're interested in building reactions and observers on top. \r\n\r\n## The changes\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Adds a generic one-to-many Relationship system\r\n3. Ports the existing Parent/Children system to Relationships, which now lives in `bevy_ecs::hierarchy`. The old `bevy_hierarchy` crate has been removed.\r\n4. Adds on_despawn component hooks\r\n5. Relationships can opt-in to \"despawn descendants\" behavior, meaning that the entire relationship hierarchy is despawned when `entity.despawn()` is called. The built in Parent/Children hierarchies enable this behavior, and `entity.despawn_recursive()` has been removed.\r\n6. `world.spawn` now applies commands after spawning. This ensures that relationship bookkeeping happens immediately and removes the need to manually flush. This is in line with the equivalent behaviors recently added to the other APIs (ex: insert).\r\n7. Removes the ValidParentCheckPlugin (system-driven / poll based) in favor of a `validate_parent_has_component` hook.\r\n\r\n## Using Relationships\r\n\r\nThe `Relationship` trait looks like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait Relationship: Component + Sized {\r\n    type RelationshipTarget: RelationshipTarget<Relationship = Self>;\r\n    fn get(&self) -> Entity;\r\n    fn from(entity: Entity) -> Self;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA relationship is a component that:\r\n\r\n1. Is a simple wrapper over a \"target\" Entity.\r\n2. Has a corresponding `RelationshipTarget` component, which is a simple wrapper over a collection of entities. Every \"target entity\" targeted by a \"source entity\" with a `Relationship` has a `RelationshipTarget` component, which contains every \"source entity\" that targets it.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the `Parent` component (as it currently exists in Bevy) is the `Relationship` component and the entity containing the Parent is the \"source entity\". The entity _inside_ the `Parent(Entity)` component is the \"target entity\". And that target entity has a `Children` component (which implements `RelationshipTarget`).\r\n\r\nIn practice, the Parent/Children relationship looks like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Relationship)]\r\n#[relationship(relationship_sources = Children)]\r\npub struct Parent(pub Entity);\r\n\r\n#[derive(RelationshipTarget)]\r\n#[relationship_sources(relationship = Parent)]\r\npub struct Children(Vec<Entity>);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Relationship and RelationshipTarget derives automatically implement Component with the relevant configuration (namely, the hooks necessary to keep everything in sync).\r\n\r\nThe most direct way to add relationships is to spawn entities with relationship components:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet a = world.spawn_empty().id();\r\nlet b = world.spawn(Parent(a)).id();\r\n\r\nassert_eq!(world.entity(a).get::<Children>().unwrap(), &[b]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are also convenience APIs for spawning more than one entity with the same relationship:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nworld.spawn_empty().with_related::<Children>(|s| {\r\n    s.spawn_empty();\r\n    s.spawn_empty();\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe existing `with_children` API is now a simpler wrapper over `with_related`. This makes this change largely non-breaking for existing spawn patterns.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nworld.spawn_empty().with_children(|s| {\r\n    s.spawn_empty();\r\n    s.spawn_empty();\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are also other relationship APIs, such as `add_related` and `despawn_related`.\r\n\r\n## Automatic recursive despawn via the new on_despawn hook\r\n\r\n`RelationshipTarget` can opt-in to \"despawn descendants\" behavior, which will despawn all related entities in the relationship hierarchy:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(RelationshipTarget)]\r\n#[relationship_sources(relationship = Parent, despawn_descendants)]\r\npub struct Children(Vec<Entity>);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that `entity.despawn_recursive()` is no longer required. Instead, just use `entity.despawn()` and the relevant related entities will also be despawned.\r\n\r\nTo despawn an entity _without_ despawning its parent/child descendants, you should remove the `Children` component first, which will also remove the related `Parent` components:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nentity\r\n    .remove::<Children>()\r\n    .despawn()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis builds on the on_despawn hook introduced in this PR, which is fired when an entity is despawned (before other hooks).\r\n\r\n## Relationships are the source of truth\r\n\r\n`Relationship` is the _single_ source of truth component. `RelationshipTarget` is merely a reflection of what all the `Relationship` components say. By embracing this, we are able to significantly improve the performance of the system as a whole. We can rely on component lifecycles to protect us against duplicates, rather than needing to scan at runtime to ensure entities don't already exist (which results in quadratic runtime). A single source of truth gives us constant-time inserts. This does mean that we cannot directly spawn populated `Children` components (or directly add or remove entities from those components). I personally think this is a worthwhile tradeoff, both because it makes the performance much better _and_ because it means theres exactly one way to do things (which is a philosophy we try to employ for Bevy APIs).\r\n\r\nAs an aside: treating both sides of the relationship as \"equivalent source of truth relations\" does enable building simple and flexible many-to-many relationships. But this introduces an _inherent_ need to scan (or hash) to protect against duplicates. [`evergreen_relations`](https://github.com/EvergreenNest/evergreen_relations) has a very nice implementation of the \"symmetrical many-to-many\" approach. Unfortunately I think the performance issues inherent to that approach make it a poor choice for Bevy's default relationship system. \r\n\r\n## Followup Work\r\n\r\n* Discuss renaming `Parent` to `ChildOf`. I refrained from doing that in this PR to keep the diff reasonable, but I'm personally biased toward this change (and using that naming pattern generally for relationships).\r\n* [Improved spawning ergonomics](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/16920)\r\n* Consider adding relationship observers/triggers for \"relationship targets\" whenever a source is added or removed. This would replace the current \"hierarchy events\" system, which is unused upstream but may have existing users downstream. I think triggers are the better fit for this than a buffered event queue, and would prefer not to add that back.\r\n* Fragmenting relations: My current idea hinges on the introduction of \"value components\" (aka: components whose type _and_ value determines their ComponentId, via something like Hashing / PartialEq). By labeling a Relationship component such as `ChildOf(Entity)` as a \"value component\",  `ChildOf(e1)` and `ChildOf(e2)` would be considered \"different components\". This makes the transition between fragmenting and non-fragmenting a single flag, and everything else continues to work as expected.\r\n* Many-to-many support\r\n    * Non-fragmenting: We can expand Relationship to be a list of entities instead of a single entity. I have largely already written the code for this.\r\n    * Fragmenting: With the \"value component\" impl mentioned above, we get many-to-many support \"for free\", as it would allow inserting multiple copies of a Relationship component with different target entities.\r\n\r\nFixes #3742 (If this PR is merged, I think we should open more targeted followup issues for the work above, with a fresh tracking issue free of the large amount of less-directed historical context)\r\nFixes #17301\r\nFixes #12235 \r\nFixes #15299\r\nFixes #15308 \r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n* Replace `ChildBuilder` with `ChildSpawnerCommands`.\r\n* Replace calls to `.set_parent(parent_id)` with `.insert(Parent(parent_id))`.\r\n* Replace calls to `.replace_children()` with `.remove::<Children>()` followed by `.add_children()`.

proposed in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17398#discussion_r1919477196 that each relationship actually have *three* names:\n* The component in the 'from' entity (the one in the one-to-many relationship), e.g. `ParentOf` (formerly `Children`).\n* The component in the 'to' entity, e.g. `ChildOf` (formerly `Parent`).\n* The name of the builder / constructor used to spawn a new entity that is related to the current entity.\n\nSo for example, something like:\n| Relation type | From Component | To Component | Constructor |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| children | `ParentOf` | `ChildOf` | `Children` |\n| observer | `ObservedBy` | `ObserverOf` | `Observers` |\n| ownership | `OwnerOf` | `OwnedBy` | (none, construction is always implicit) |\n\nI didn't specify names for reactions because

would prefer it if we didn't need to build special-cased constructors for these things:\n\n1. I don't love having two names for the same concept.\n2. I'd like these APIs to be relationship-type-driven, especially given that Relationships are a \"generic user-facing system\". Ideally they define both sides of the relationship and can immediately start spawning things in the same way Bevy's built-in relationships do it.\n\nEx: If ParentOf is the component name, then it should also be the thing that we use during spawn. ParentOf is actually reasonable in this context:\n\n```rust\nworld.spawn((\n    Foo,\n    ParentOf::spawn((\n        Spawn(Bar),\n        Spawn(Baz),\n    )),\n))\n\nworld.spawn((\n    Foo,\n    parent_of![\n        Bar,\n        Baz,\n    ]\n));\n\nbsn! {(\n    Foo,\n    ParentOf [\n        Bar,\n        Baz,\n    ]\n)}\n```\n(note that my current plan for BSN and `ParentOf` is to make `[ ]` imply `ParentOf []`)\n\nIf we do want to refer to the \"collection of childof relationships\" as \"children\" in this context, then we should violate our \"IsA\" constraint and just give it the name that makes us happy. Needing to connect ParentOf to a new \"children\" concept name is confusing and needlessly complicated. I don't think losing IsA here is a particular loss. It wouldn't be the first or the last case where \"IsA\" naming doesn't quite fit (as mentioned above).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2599148343/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-19T01:51:23Z","updated_at":"2025-01-19T01:51:23Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17427","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17427/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17427/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17427/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17427","id":2797342440,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86IQRk9","number":17427,"title":"Parent -> ChildOf","user":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

I left some more thoughts there (but lets discuss here):\n\n> * I like that the `XOf` and `XBy` naming convention helps indicate that a component is a relationship. We don't see these names much elsewhere in the wild, so it is a reasonably strong indicator that a given component is a relationship. And it helps resolve the ambiguity of `Parent` (_is_ it a parent, or does it _have_ a parent?)\n> * I think this _does_ reduce the legibility of things, especially on the `RelationshipTarget` side (ex: `Children` vs `ParentOf`). There are _a lot_ of use cases where the variable name would _really_ benefit from being `children` and not `parent_of`. Iterating or indexing a `ParentOf` is harder to mentally wrap my head around compared to iterating `Children`. Having seen the effects on the code using these APIs, I'm _kind of_ biased toward using the plural / \"has a\" naming convention (`Children`), while still moving to the `ChildOf` convention for actual Relationships.

hope this comment amounts to more than just bike shedding, but what about `ParentRef` and `ChildRefs`? I refer to my own code (admittedly it's arguable whether _my_ code is a good reference), where I use these two suffixes and it seems intuitive to me. I'd also possibly ask, if the `XOf` and `XBy` conventions become recommended, would my code ideally be rewritten using those conventions? If so, does that make sense?\n\nI removed the derives for brevity.\n\n```rust\n/// A component that can store a reference to a list of unit entities.\npub struct UnitRefs(pub Vec<Entity>);\n\n/// A component to store a list of references to the target entity that a\n/// regiment is moving to.\npub struct MoveTargetRefs(pub Vec<Entity>);\n\n/// A component that can store a reference to a regiment entity.\npub struct RegimentRef(pub Entity);\n\n/// A component that can store a reference to a regiment's leader entity.\npub struct RegimentLeaderRef(pub Entity);\n```\n\nReferring to the first updated example in #17427:\n\n```rust\nmut interaction_query: Query<\n    (\n        &Interaction,\n        &mut BackgroundColor,\n        &mut BorderColor,\n        &ParentOf,\n    ),\n    (Changed<Interaction>, With<Button>),\n>,\n```\n\nI don't know if it's just me, but I struggle to understand what \"parent of\" means here: It's hurts trying to work it out. I know I _can_ work it out, but yeah it doesn't look obviously clear to me by reading the query alone.\n\nReplace it with `ChildRefs` and, at the very least, I now know it's going to be a list of entities.\n\n```rust\nmut interaction_query: Query<\n    (\n        &Interaction,\n        &mut BackgroundColor,\n        &mut BorderColor,\n        &ChildRefs,\n    ),\n    (Changed<Interaction>, With<Button>),\n>,\n```\n\nSame with `ChildOf` example. Before, what are we asking for? \"Give me interaction entities and its child of\". To me that terminology doesn't make sense at all, but I'd be happy for someone to rewrite it with terminology that does make sense.\n\n```rust\nmut interaction_query: Query<(&Interaction, &ChildOf), (Changed<Interaction>, With<Button>)>,\n```\n\nAfter, we now know we're asking for the reference to the parent: \"Give me interaction entities and the ref to its parent\"\n\n```rust\nmut interaction_query: Query<(&Interaction, &ParentRef), (Changed<Interaction>, With<Button>)>,\n```","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2600581009/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mgi388","id":135186256,"node_id":"U_kgDOCA7HUA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135186256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388","html_url":"https://github.com/mgi388","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2600790921","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17412#issuecomment-2600790921","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17412","id":2600790921,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86bBOuJ","user":{"login":"eidloi","id":20684057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjg0MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20684057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi","html_url":"https://github.com/eidloi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-19T10:04:30Z","updated_at":"2025-01-19T10:04:30Z","body":"On one hand the English language already defines dedicated words for a number of relationships and rules to form words for new ones.
