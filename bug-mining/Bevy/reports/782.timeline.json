0.16-rc.1\n\n## What went wrong\n\nAfter updating to `0.16-rc.1`I began to see this crash intermittently. I see it something like 1/4 of the times I run the program, the other times it runs without any panic. It appears to always happen in the frame where I first render 3d meshes. The splash screen and loading screens, which use only 2d and UI elements have never triggered the panic.\n\nI have removed all my custom materials and pipelines and the error still occurs.\n\n## Additional information\n\nI see other rendering glitches which may be related but I'm not sure. The other problem is that some, but not all, meshes flicker between being in the correct location and being offset or disappearing entirely when the camera moves. That feels to me like a problem with memory alignment or something in the bindings, which is why I think it might be related to the buffer overrun. But when I look at the frames in renderdoc it doesn't show any errors or warnings which I would expect if it really was related to alignment.\n\nI'm still trimming my code down looking for a minimal example but I'm going to go ahead and post this now in the hopes that the problem is obvious to someone without that.\n\nLogs:\n```\n2025-03-25T17:47:43.360364Z ERROR system{name=\"bevy_render::renderer::render_system\"}:submit_graph_commands:main_opaque_pass_3d: wgpu::backend::wgpu_core: Handling wgpu errors as fatal by default\n   0: bevy_core_pipeline::core_3d::main_opaque_pass_3d_node::main_opaque_pass_3d\n             at /home/user/Code/Vendor/bevy/crates/bevy_core_pipeline/src/core_3d/main_opaque_pass_3d_node.rs:73\n   1: bevy_render::renderer::graph_runner::submit_graph_commands\n             at /home/user/Code/Vendor/bevy/crates/bevy_render/src/renderer/graph_runner.rs:91\n   2: bevy_ecs::system::function_system::system\n           with name=\"bevy_render::renderer::render_system\"\n             at /home/user/Code/Vendor/bevy/crates/bevy_ecs/src/system/function_system.rs:65\n\nthread '<unnamed>' panicked at /home/user/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/wgpu-24.0.3/src/backend/wgpu_core.rs:3273:26:\nwgpu error: Validation Error\n\nCaused by:\n  In RenderPass::end\n    In a draw command, kind: DrawIndirect\n      Indirect draw uses bytes 160..180 using count 1 which overruns indirect buffer of size 160\n\n\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\n2025-03-25T17:47:43.360655Z  WARN system{name=\"bevy_render::renderer::render_system\"}:submit_graph_commands: bevy_render::diagnostic::internal: Failed to download render statistics buffer: Error occurred when trying to async map a buffer\nEncountered a panic in system `bevy_render::renderer::render_system`!\n   0: bevy_render::pipelined_rendering::render thread\n             at /home/user/Code/Vendor/bevy/crates/bevy_render/src/pipelined_rendering.rs:151\n\nthread '<unnamed>' panicked at /home/user/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/wgpu-hal-24.0.2/src/vulkan/instance.rs:173:58:\nTrying to destroy a SurfaceSemaphores that is still in use by a SurfaceTexture\nstack backtrace:\n   0:     0x72ac75f7e6d2 -

For example:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4600e38-10a5-4d94-97af-81bcb1b5bdf8)\n\nI've dragged the window here to cover the bottom row, but 2 of the eyelids that get removed are on the top row. You can replicate this with any row size, for example with 10x10 we'd see 10 eyelids getting removed. However, importantly, this seems to be pretty deterministic. When I restart the program, the same eyelids are always removed.\n\nThis suggests there's some kind of indexing error in how our mesh instances are getting written out to the GPU. I've confirmed that the instances we keep on the CPU are correct, and so I'm not totally sure what's happening.\n\nIt's also possible to break things more extremely:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1678f33f-582d-4c63-b067-b49e9cf9eef9)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f44ed46-ed2b-45e7-839e-b7a91a5b8d4c)\n\nThis happens when resizing the windows such that all of the meshes are culled. Even when moving pretty slowly, they can be left in states with weird broken transforms.\n\nHave to stop here for tonight.\n\n@alec-deason Would you mind uploading the version without morph
