Objective\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of problems when trying to use CustomMaterials in cobination with a prepass:\r\n\r\n1. Right now when you try to run a custom prepass material that doesn't have a normal attribute (e.g. because you manually pack your mesh data, or generate it on the fly) bevy refuses to use it and logs the following:\r\n`Mesh is missing requested attribute: Vertex_Normal (MeshVertexAttributeId(1), pipeline type: Some(\"bevy_pbr::prepass::PrepassPipeline<bevy_voxel::voxel_engine::rendering::CustomMaterialA>\"))`\r\n\r\nThis PR should also fix #13054.\r\n\r\n2. Fixing the first problem revealed a second problem: the shader function `deferred_output` is used across the engine both for generic prepasses and deferred repasses. However, it lacked necessary checks to ensure the deferred data is only written if the prepass actually uses deferred rendering.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n1. I added an if check to make sure the normal attribute is actually used.\r\n2. The old `deferred_output` method was replaced with `prepass_output`, which works both when deferred rendering is disabled and enabled.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Did you test these changes? If so, how?\r\nYes, I ran my experimental game project and bevy no longer complained about the missing attribute.\r\n- Are there any parts that need more testing?\r\nNot that I am aware of.\r\n- How can other people (reviewers) test your changes? Is there anything specific they need to know?\r\nTry to use a prepass material that doesn't have a normal attribute.\r\n- If relevant, what platforms did you test these changes on, and are there any important ones you can't test?\r\nI tested this on linux/vulkan, but I don't see why that would have any impact on this particular bug.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThe shader function `pbr_deferred_functions::deferred_output` was replaced with `prepass_utils::prepass_output`. The new function should behave identical to the old one, with the added benefit of no longer crashing when running in a prepass without deferred lighting.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13569/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16324078095,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86Ga9juzwAAAAPM_aoP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16324078095","actor":{"login":"terahlunah","id":3194492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3194492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah","html_url":"https://github.com/terahlunah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-16T12:13:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"terahlunah","id":3194492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTQ0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3194492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah","html_url":"https://github.com/terahlunah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/terahlunah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-16T13:59:55Z","updated_at":"2025-02-16T13:59:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17881","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17881/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17881/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17881/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17881","id":2856118632,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86LXrCN","number":17881,"title":"Allow
