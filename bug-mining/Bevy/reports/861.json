Fallible systems as conditions need to either panic or do their own error handling, they hardly can snap into the usual error handling.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nImplement `SystemCondition` for systems returning `Result<bool, BevyError>`.\n\nThe exact behavior on an error must be decided on: Should it go through the error handler? Either way, only systems returning `Ok(true)` should cause the condition to be evaluated as met.\n\nSystems returning `Result<(), BevyError>` could also be used as conditions where `Ok(())` is considered as a met condition.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
