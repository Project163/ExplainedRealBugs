Currently, a failed load causes the `LoadState`, `DependencyLoadState`, and `RecursiveDependencyLoadState` to all be set to `Failed`. I would have expected only the `LoadState` to be set to failed unless the intent is that each deeper level `LoadState` encompasses the parent? Not sure exactly what these states are supposed to represent in the success/fail cases.\r\n\r\n2. I'm pretty new to Rust, is it reasonable to create an `Arc<AssetLoadError>` and clone it into each different LoadState level (replacing the Box in the regular `LoadState`)? Feels like a lot of cloning but I'm not sure what else to do without adding lifetime params to a bunch of types.\r\n\r\n3. The API currently includes `load_state` and `get_load_state` for each level of LoadState. The former calls the latter and adds an `unwrap_or`:\r\n```\r\npub fn get_load_state(&self, id: impl Into<UntypedAssetId>) -> Option<LoadState> {\r\n    self.data\r\n        .infos\r\n        .read()\r\n        .get(id.into())\r\n        .map(|i| i.load_state.clone())\r\n}\r\n\r\npub fn load_state(&self, id: impl Into<UntypedAssetId>) -> LoadState {\r\n    self.get_load_state(id).unwrap_or(LoadState::NotLoaded)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIs this something we want to keep? It isn't super clear why you would want one or the other.\r\n\r\nSorry for all the

you, sounds good regarding 2 and 3. I’ll leave the semantics as is for 1 and look into them later if needed.\r\n\r\nThinking forward, I’m not sure I understand the value of the non-recursive DependencyLoadState and I also saw there are multiple types of dependencies (normal and loader) which are not distinguishable by LoadState. Both could be worth looking into if there is a semantic change in the future.\r\n\r\nAny idea if these same asset dependencies are intended to be used as part of the bsn hierarchy?\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2350851885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"crvarner","id":10468631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDY4NjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10468631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner","html_url":"https://github.com/crvarner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2351043294","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15098#issuecomment-2351043294","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15098","id":2351043294,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86MIhLe","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-14T15:57:48Z","updated_at":"2024-09-14T15:57:48Z","body":"> I’m not sure I understand the value of the non-recursive DependencyLoadState\r\n\r\nSeconding this!
