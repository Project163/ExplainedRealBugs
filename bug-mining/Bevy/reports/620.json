It would be helpful to unify the logic for handling fields and their containers.\r\n\r\nFor example, my reflective property inspector widget uses a set of nested widgets, so if you are editing say a struct containing an option containing an f32, you have three widgets: a struct inspector, an option inspector, and an f32 inspector. However, the logic for the struct inspector has to be different because it's operating at the root level.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nIt would be convenient if the various reflection methods that accept paths would permit a zero-length path. This would operate on the entire struct/tuple/whatever, instead of on a specific field.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nI could do this myself by adding a check for `is_empty()` on the path, but this would introduce additional clutter in my code.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nDiscord thread: https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1002362493634629796/1242538258211143783","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13459/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
