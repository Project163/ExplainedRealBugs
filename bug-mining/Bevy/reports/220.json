I wanted to load a Gltf dependency with `GltfLoaderSettings::include_source` and traverse it myself in an `AssetLoader`.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\nI'd be fine with a simple addition of `load_direct_with_settings`, though perhaps it gets a bit much with all the permutations of arguments if `load_direct_with_settings_from_reader` were to be added as well.\r\n\r\nI would therefore suggest that there are only two load functions returning handles (`LoadContext::load`, `LoadContext::load_from_reader`) with an `Option` argument for settings in both, and then have one `async LoadContext::get_direct(Handle) -> Result<ErasedLoadedAsset, E>`, with the added benefit of being able to await any asset Handle.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\nAfaikt, the alternative is to wait for the dependency to load by listening to Events in a system. It's doable, but quite clunky compared to the async provided by the AssetLoader interface.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12963/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
