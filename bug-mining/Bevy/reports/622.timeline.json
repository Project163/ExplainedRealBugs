I suppose what we should probably do is to check the max sampler count and if it’s too high for the material, disable bindless for that material. Varying the chunk size isn’t really an option right now because wgpu presently requires all binding arrays to have fixed size specified in the shader.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2564554342/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pcwalton","id":157897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton","html_url":"https://github.com/pcwalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15787663763,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86khL5tzwAAAAOtBKGT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15787663763","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9e4c07238b1eac49b11cf8822dda5b4a9daeb37c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/9e4c07238b1eac49b11cf8822dda5b4a9daeb37c","created_at":"2024-12-31T00:21:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15816691592,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86khL5tzwAAAAOuv4-I","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15816691592","actor":{"login":"pcwalton","id":157897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton","html_url":"https://github.com/pcwalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"da2a03fb9eb9cfdaf49d4f735895b1e07d8721f0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pcwalton/bevy/commits/da2a03fb9eb9cfdaf49d4f735895b1e07d8721f0","created_at":"2025-01-05T04:39:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"pcwalton","id":157897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton","html_url":"https://github.com/pcwalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events","type"
