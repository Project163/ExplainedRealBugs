Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #13214\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nDelegates to internal type when possible, otherwise uses `ChosenColorSpace` as an intermediary. This _will_ double convert, but this is considered an acceptable compromise since use of specific colour types in performance critical colour operations is already encouraged.\r\n\r\n`ChosenColorSpace` is `Oklcha` since it's perceptually uniform while supporting all required operations, and in my opinion is the \"best\" for this task. Using different spaces for different operations will make documenting this double-conversion behaviour more challenging.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nChanges straightforward enough to not require testing beyond current CI in my opinion.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Implemented the following traits for `Color`:\r\n  - `Luminance`\r\n  - `Hue`\r\n  - `Mix`\r\n  - `EuclideanDistance`\r\n  - `ClampColor`\r\n- Added documentation to `Color` explaining the behaviour of these operations (possible conversion,

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nAs discussed in #12056, widespread use of the `Color` type (which is an enum holding variants that map to all of the supported color spaces) is not ideal.\r\n\r\nRight now, it is used in virtually all user-facing configuration (e.g. gizmo builders, clear color, fog settings, `BackgroundColor` components). This decision was primarily made to ease the initial migration: it maps closely to the previous `bevy_render::Color` enum (but stores types instead of fields).\r\n\r\nBy contrast, internal, rendering-focused abstractions store `LinearRgba`: this is the color format that users expect.\r\n\r\nWe should make a decision on this pattern before shipping the new color type to users. There will not be a perfect decision: there are very real trade-offs with each choice, but the choice should be deliberate, rather than incidental.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\n- Don't waste resources: only pay conversion costs to `LinearRgba` once, and ideally only use 4 bytes of memory (4 f32).\r\n- Inspector tools can read and manipulate color types in any color space.\r\n- Color can be serialized and deserialized in the format of the user's choice.\r\n- Make sure that defining and using colors in code is easy, no matter what color model the user wants to use.\r\n\r\n## Possible solutions\r\n\r\n1. Keep using the polymorphic `Color` enum.\r\n\r\n**Advantages:** easy to migrate, stores the exact stable values provided by users.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantage:** requires conversion into `LinearRgba` every time the data needs to be extracted to the GPU. Requires runtime checks for color types, most useful operations are not defined on this type.\r\n\r\n2. Store `LinearRgba` everywhere.\r\n\r\n**Advantages:** All color spaces can be directly converted into it. Save on conversion costs. Great for PBR operations.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages:** LinearRGB is the worst color space for most perceptual operations. Data about the original color space is thrown away.\r\n\r\n3. Store a perceptual color (probably `Oklcha`) everywhere.\r\n\r\n**Advantages:** much better for interpolation, blending and manipulation.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages:** very unusual choice, expensive repeated conversions. Not all color spaces can be directly converted.\r\n\r\n4. Store a cached `LinearRgba` inside of `Color`, and lock down direct access to this type to ensure validity.\r\n\r\n**Advantages:** Preserves information about the original color space, doesn't involve constant re-conversions. Converting out to other color types is faster.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages:** API becomes more complex, memory usage at rest doubles from 4 to 8 bytes. Still don't get to do nice color operations directly.\r\n\r\n5. Store a different color type in each of our APIs (or perhaps crates) depending on unique needs and benchmarks.\r\n\r\n**Advantages:** We can get the best of all worlds, and make the right choice for each domain.\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages:** Much more complex to learn and maintain.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThis decision was split from #12163 to avoid excessive delays as we come to a decision here. The correct path forward for #12188 will depend on the decision made here.\r\n\r\ncc @cart @IceSentry @rparrett @Trashtalk217 @viridia","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12212/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12799976958,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86HzC0WzwAAAAL68CX-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12799976958","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6482a036cb13b768d92fd536becb4df3a3677ed9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/6482a036cb13b768d92fd536becb4df3a3677ed9","created_at":"2024-05-14T10:45:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12799977189,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86HzC0WzwAAAAL68Cbl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12799977189","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-14T10:45:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14867726790,"node_id":"RFPVTE_lADODf6-U86HzC0WzwAAAAN2L4HG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14867726790","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"removed_from_project_v2","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-23T21:33:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
