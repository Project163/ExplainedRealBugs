However this is not clear from the error message provided of \"divide by zero\".\n\nThe following seems to be able to reproduce the issue and commented section is how to resolve it.\n\n```rust\nfn reproduce(mut commands: Commands, mut meshes: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>) {\n    commands.spawn(Mesh3d(meshes.add(\n        Mesh::new(\n            render_resource::PrimitiveTopology::TriangleList,\n            RenderAssetUsages::all(),\n        ), //.with_inserted_attribute(Mesh::ATTRIBUTE_POSITION, Vec::<Vec3>::new()),\n    )));\n}\n```\n\nWhen I ran across this issue I had no way of telling what was wrong with my code or how to resolve it and feel that it would be helpful to have a more meaningful error message in this situation.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19710/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"kerstop","id":33494124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDk0MTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33494124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop","html_url":"https://github.com/kerstop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-03T19:07:47Z","updated_at":"2025-07-03T19:07:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19938","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19938/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19938/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19938/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19938","id":3200388280,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86dUn-f","number":19938,"title":"Skip allocation of zero size meshes","user":{"login":"kerstop","id":33494124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDk0MTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33494124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop","html_url":"https://github.com/kerstop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kerstop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619323,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Bug","name":"C-Bug","color":"d73a4a","default":false,"description":"An unexpected or incorrect behavior"},{"id":2045383863,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQ1MzgzODYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-Rendering","name":"A-Rendering","color":"C6A751","default":false,"description":"Drawing game state to the screen"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #16525\r\nFixes #19710\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nNot allocating a mesh if it is empty.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI tested using the following minimum repro from #16525\r\n```rust\r\nuse bevy::{asset::RenderAssetUsages, prelude::*, render::mesh::PrimitiveTopology};\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    App::new()\r\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\r\n        .add_systems(Startup, setup)\r\n        .run();\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn setup(\r\n    mut commands: Commands,\r\n    mut meshes: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>,\r\n    mut materials: ResMut<Assets<ColorMaterial>>,\r\n) {\r\n    commands.spawn(Camera2d);\r\n\r\n    let mesh = Mesh::new(\r\n        PrimitiveTopology::TriangleList,\r\n        RenderAssetUsages::default(),\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    commands.spawn((\r\n        Mesh2d(meshes.add(mesh)),\r\n        MeshMaterial2d(materials.add(Color::hsl(180.0, 0.95, 0.7))),\r\n    ));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI was able to test on webgl2 and windows native and the issue seems to be resolved. I am not familiar with how mesh rendering works and feel like just skipping meshes should cause issues but I did not notice any.
