This is especially important in hybrid application that use Bevy only in game or multiple bevy instances. \r\n\r\nA similar issue was mentioned here [12195](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/12195) in the bevy repo. The proposed solution there is not suited for my usecase since it makes communication between the iframe and the host application difficult to impossible.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\nThere exists an already implemented feature in winit solving the same problem I showed. The related issue is [2897](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/2897) and [2720](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/2720) in the winit repo. It should be possible to use this feature similarly to how conditionally already some features of android and co are used in the bevy winit plugin.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\nCurrently there seems at least in the bevy side of things no other solution. It might be possible to completely shutdown wasm and load the bevy application completely from scratch. But these solution seem hacky on not like good solutions.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12562/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12562/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
