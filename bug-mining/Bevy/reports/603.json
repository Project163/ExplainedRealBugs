There are no other assets folders in the workspace.\n`main_bevy_game` enables `file_watcher` feature, and then in `main.rs`:\n\n```\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.set(AssetPlugin {\n            watch_for_changes_override: Some(true),\n            ..Default::default()\n        }));\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\nOn launch, bevy issues the following warning: \n\n`WARN bevy_asset::io::source: Skip creating file watcher because path \"assets\" does not exist.`\n\nCreating a folder at the root of the workspace will suppress this warning, but file changes are not recognized.\n\nMoving the assets folder to the root of the workspace causes a panic:\n\n`Failed to create file watcher from path \"assets\", Error { kind: PathNotFound, paths: [\"/Users/notarealuser/workspace/main_bevy_game/assets\"] }`\n\n(Path altered for privacy)\n\n## Additional information\n\nI believe this is from using a raw `std::path::PathBuf` to test if the assets folder exists whereas in most other cases it gets built out.\nI have a quick one-line fix:\n\n`bevy_asset` crate @ `bevy_assets/src/io/source.rs`\n\n line 534:\n`                let path = super::file::get_base_path().join(path.clone());`\n\nThis builds the path as it does in `file::FileWatcher::new()` and seems to make everything work as expected.\n\nThis might not be the appropriate fix, or perhaps my project structure is not as intended. I'm not sure, so I haven't opened a PR for this one line change.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16879/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
