I worry that just having objects silently not appear for a few frames is not the behavior that every app wants.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\n> [JMS55](https://github.com/JMS55) commented [2 weeks ago](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10812#issuecomment-1924486623)\r\n> I'd like to leave that to a followup. We can put it in the RenderPlugin settings, but it's a bit of a pain.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nA proper way of doing pipeline preloading would be more useful, but that seems far off.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nIt seems like this would be especially desirable for apps that are doing automatic screenshotting -- without this they would need to either wait some arbitrary amount of time before screenshotting, or track pipeline status.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11846/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
