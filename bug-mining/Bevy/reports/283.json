Rendering works fine, but trying to despawn a broken entity regardless of where the despawn is started in the hierarchy from always causes the panic. *Might* be related to entity versions, but it's just a feeling.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nAfter two weeks of pulling all-nighters (and my hair) I have this `EntityCommand` that can safely remove broken entities (naming altered for politeness):\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\nstruct UntuckThisBirch;\r\nimpl EntityCommand for UntuckThisBirch{\r\n    fn apply(self, id: Entity, world: &mut World) {\r\n        let Ok(parent) = world.query::<&Parent>().get(world, id) else {\r\n            return;\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        let parent_id = parent.get();\r\n        let Ok(parent_children) = world.query::<&Children>().get(world, parent_id) else {\r\n            return;\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        let children: Vec<Entity> = parent_children\r\n            .iter()\r\n            .filter(|child| **child != id)\r\n            .map(|child| *child)\r\n            .collect();\r\n        let mut parent = world.entity_mut(parent_id);\r\n        parent.replace_children(&children);\r\n\r\n        world.resource_scope(|world, mut ui_surface: Mut<UiSurface>| {\r\n            let Ok(parent_children) = world.query::<&Children>().get(world, parent_id) else {\r\n                return;\r\n            };\r\n\r\n            ui_surface.update_children(parent_id, parent_children);\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        world.despawn(id);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is called in context like so:\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\ncommands.entity(entity).despawn_descendants();\r\ncommands.entity(entity).add(UntuckThisBirch);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: The above command works, and I can despawn the broken entity _targetedly_. **HOWEVER, calling `despawn_descendants` from higher up in the hierarchy without removing the broken entity first also causes the same panic!**","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12403/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
