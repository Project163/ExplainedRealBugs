Objective\r\n\r\nCloses #14474\r\n\r\nPreviously, the `libm` feature of bevy_math would just pass the same feature flag down to glam. However, bevy_math itself had many uses of floating-point arithmetic with unspecified precision. For example, `f32::sin_cos` and `f32::powi` have unspecified precision, which means that the exact details of their output are not guaranteed to be stable across different systems and/or versions of Rust. This means that users of bevy_math could observe slightly different behavior on different systems if these methods were used. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to make it so that the `libm` feature flag actually guarantees some degree of determinacy within bevy_math itself by switching to the libm versions of these functions when the `libm` feature is enabled.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nbevy_math now has an internal module `bevy_math::ops`, which re-exports either the standard versions of the operations or the libm versions depending on whether the `libm` feature is enabled. For example, `ops::sin` compiles to `f32::sin` without the `libm` feature and to `libm::sinf` with it.\r\n\r\nThis approach has a small shortfall, which is that `f32::powi` (integer powers of floating point numbers) does not have an equivalent in `libm`. On the other hand, this method is only used for squaring and cubing numbers in bevy_math. Accordingly, this deficit is covered by the introduction of a trait `ops::FloatPow`:\r\n```rust\r\npub(crate) trait FloatPow {\r\n    fn squared(self) -> Self;\r\n    fn cubed(self) -> Self;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, each current usage of the unspecified-precision methods has been replaced by its equivalent in `ops`, so that when `libm` is enabled, the libm version is used instead. The exception, of course, is that `.powi(2)`/`.powi(3)` have been replaced with `.squared()`/`.cubed()`.\r\n\r\nFinally, the usage of the plain `f32` methods with unspecified precision is now linted out of bevy_math (and hence disallowed in CI). For example, using `f32::sin` within bevy_math produces a warning that tells the user to use the `ops::sin` version instead. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nRan existing tests. It would be nice to check some benchmarks on NURBS things once #14677 merges. I'm happy to wait until then if the rest of this PR is fine.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nIn the future, it might make sense to actually expose `bevy_math::ops` as public if any downstream Bevy crates want to provide similar determinacy guarantees. For now, it's all just `pub(crate)`. \r\n\r\nThis PR also only covers `f32`. If we find ourselves using `f64` internally in parts of bevy_math for better robustness, we could extend the module and lints to cover the `f64` versions easily enough.\r\n\r\nI don't know how feasible it is, but it would also be nice if we could standardize the bevy_math tests with the `libm` feature in CI, since their success is currently platform-dependent (e.g. 8 of them fail on my machine when run locally).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14693/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13851877383,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86Q2DwzzwAAAAM5ouAH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13851877383","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"61a1530c560ddf109962f85dc2889cfd8e56691b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/61a1530c560ddf109962f85dc2889cfd8e56691b","created_at":"2024-08-12T16:30:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13851877545,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86Q2DwzzwAAAAM5ouCp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13851877545","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-12T16:30:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
