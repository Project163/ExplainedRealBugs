Objective\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation of `Sprite::compute_pixel_space_point` always returns the sprite centre as an `Ok` point when the `custom_size` is set to `Vec2::ZERO`. This leads to unexpected behaviour. For example, it causes these sprites to block all interactions with other sprites in the picking backend (under default settings). This small PR:\r\n\r\n- Fixes sprite pixel space point computation for sprites with zero custom_size\r\n- Resolves issue #19880.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nWe handle the zero custom_size case explicitly and return `Err(point_relative_to_sprite_center)`  instead of `Ok(point_relative_to_texture)`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nImplemented a new test for zero custom_size sprites within the `bevy_sprite::sprite` module. Also verified that the example from issue #19880 is behaving as expected.\r\n\r\nNo further testing is required.\r\n\r\n- How can other people (reviewers) test your changes? Is there anything specific they need to know?\r\n\r\nCan run the simple application example from the linked issue. Or evaluate the implemented test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19907/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18427229838,"node_id":"RTE_lADODf6-U86-Bhy6zwAAAARKWTaO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18427229838","actor":{"login":"AtheMathmo","id":10150986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTUwOTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10150986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo","html_url":"https://github.com/AtheMathmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-02T08:37:41Z","rename":{"from":"Zero
