It makes it a bit harder to reuse,\nand causes some UX problems when trying to twiddle values in an entity inspector.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nSplit the `FreeCam` component into two parts: one for state and one for settings.\n\nGive the `FreeCam` (pretty) name to the settings (since that's the thing users should be defining / tweaking), and call the other one `FreeCamState`.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nSplit this into three parts, adding another component just for keybindings. But eh, #435 is going to wreak havoc with that anyways.\n\nWe could also just leave it alone. It's not that bad.\n\n## Additional context\n\nWe should also consider changing how enabling/disabling the camera controls works, and move more of the system state into the component for reduced weirdness.\n\nThose should all be separate PRs though, and again, #435 will force a refactor of our disabling mechanism, as input managers provide that functionality out of the box.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
