Objective\r\n\r\n- `AssetTransformer` provides an input asset, and output an asset, but provides no access to the `LabeledAsset`'s created by the `AssetLoader`. Labeled sub assets are an extremely important piece of many assets, Gltf in particular, and without them the amount of transformation on an asset is limited. In order for `AssetTransformer`'s to be useful, they need to have access to these sub assets.\r\n- LabeledAsset's loaded by `AssetLoader`s are provided to `AssetSaver`s in the `LoadAndSave` process, but the `LoadTransformAndSave` process drops these values in the transform stage, and so `AssetSaver` is given none.\r\n- Fixes #11606\r\n\r\nIdeally the AssetTransformer should not ignore labeled sub assets, and they should be kept at least for the AssetSaver\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- I created a new struct similar to `SavedAsset` named `TransformedAsset` which holds the input asset, and the HashMap of `LabeledAsset`s. The transform function now takes as input a `TransformedAsset`, and returns a `TransformedAsset::<AssetOutput>`. This gives the transform function access to the labeled sub assets created by the `AssetLoader`.\r\n- I also created `TransformedSubAsset` which holds mutable references to a sub asset and that sub assets HashMap of `LabeledAsset`s. This allows you to travers the Tree of `LabeledAsset`s by reference relatively easily.\r\n- The `LoadTransformAndSave` processor was then reworked to use the new structs, stopping the `LabeledAsset`s from being dropped.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Created TransformedAsset struct and TransformedSubAsset struct.\r\n- Changed `get_untyped_handle` to return a `UntypedHandle` directly rather than a reference and added `get_handle` as a typed variant in SavedAsset and TransformedAsset\r\n- Added `SavedAsset::from_transformed` as a constructor from a `TransformedAsset`\r\n- Switched LoadTransformAndSave process code to work with new `TransformedAsset` type\r\n- Added a `ProcessError` for `AssetTransformer` in process.rs\r\n- Switched `AssetTransformer::transform` to use `TransformedAsset` as input and output.\r\n- Switched `AssetTransformer` to use a `BoxedFuture` like `AssetLoader` and `AssetSaver` to allow for async transformation code.\r\n- Updated AssetTransformer example to use new
