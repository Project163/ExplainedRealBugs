Objective\r\n\r\n- Significantly improve the ergonomics of gamepads and allow new features\r\n\r\nGamepads are a bit unergonomic to work with, they use resources but unlike other inputs, they are not limited to a single gamepad, to get around this it uses an identifier (Gamepad) to interact with anything causing all sorts of inconveniences.\r\n\r\n1.  There are too many structs: Gamepads, GamepadSettings, GamepadInfo, ButtonInput<T>, 2 Axis<T>.\r\n2. ButtonInput/Axis generic methods become really inconvenient to use e.g. any_pressed() \r\n3. GamepadButton/Axis structs are unnecessary boilerplate:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfor gamepad in gamepads.iter() {\r\n        if button_inputs.just_pressed(GamepadButton::new(gamepad, GamepadButtonType::South)) {\r\n            info!(\"{:?} just pressed South\", gamepad);\r\n        } else if button_inputs.just_released(GamepadButton::new(gamepad, GamepadButtonType::South))\r\n        {\r\n            info!(\"{:?} just released South\", gamepad);\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. Projects often need to create resources to store the selected gamepad and have to manually check if their gamepad is still valid anyways.\r\n\r\n- Previously attempted by #3419 and #12674\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Implement gamepads as entities.\r\n\r\nUsing entities solves all the problems above and opens new possibilities. \r\n\r\n1. Reduce boilerplate and allows iteration\r\n```rust\r\nlet is_pressed = gamepads_buttons.iter().any(|buttons| buttons.pressed(GamepadButton::South))\r\n```\r\n2. ButtonInput/Axis generic methods become ergonomic again \r\n```rust\r\ngamepad.any_just_pressed([GamepadButton::Start, GamepadButton::Select])\r\n```\r\n3. Reduces the number of public components significantly (Gamepad, GamepadSettings)\r\n4. Components are highly convenient. Gamepad optional features could now be expressed naturally (`Option<Rumble> or Option<Gyro>`), allows devs to attach their own components and filter them, so code like this becomes possible:\r\n```rust\r\nfn move_player<const T: usize>(\r\n    player: Query<&Transform, With<Player<T>>>,\r\n    gamepads: Query<&Gamepad, With<Player<T>>>,\r\n) {\r\n    if let Ok(gamepad) = gamepads.get_single() {\r\n        if gamepad.pressed(GamepadButton::South) {\r\n            // move player\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Follow-up\r\n\r\n- [ ] Run conditions?\r\n- [ ] Rumble component\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\nGamepads are now entities instead of resources.\r\nFiltering is now done in bevy_input instead of bevy_gilrs.\r\nRawGamepad events are made available to users.\r\n\r\n## Added\r\n\r\n- RawGamepadEvent\r\n- RawGamepadAxisChangedEvent\r\n- RawGamepadButtonChangedEvent\r\n- Gamepad component\r\n- GamepadSettings component\r\n- GamepadInput enum\r\n  - Encapsulation over GamepadButton and GamepadAxis to share the Gamepad.get and Gamepad.get_clamped methods and Axis<T>\r\n\r\n## Changed\r\n\r\n- GamepadAxisType to GamepadAxis\r\n- GamepadButtonType to GamepadButton\r\n- GamepadButtonInput event to GamepadButtonStateChangedEvent\r\n\r\n## Removed\r\n\r\n- Axis<GamepadButton> resource\r\n- Axis<GamepadAxis> resource\r\n- ButtonInput<GamepadButton>\r\n- GamepadSettings resource\r\n- Gamepads resource\r\n- Old GamepadAxis no longer exists\r\n- Old GamepadButton no longer exists\r\n\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nGamepad input is no longer accessed using resources, instead they are entities and are accessible using the Gamepad component as long as the gamepad is connected.\r\n\r\nGamepads resource has been deleted, instead of using an internal id to identify gamepads you can use its Entity. Disconnected gamepads will **NOT** be despawned. Gamepad components that don't need to preserve their state will be removed i.e. Gamepad component is removed, but GamepadSettings is kept.\r\nReconnected gamepads will try to preserve their Entity id and necessary components will be re-inserted.\r\n\r\nGamepadSettings is no longer a resource, instead it is a component attached to the Gamepad entity.\r\n\r\nAxis<GamepadButton>, Axis<GamepadAxis> and ButtonInput<GamepadButton> methods are accessible via Gamepad component.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nfn gamepad_system(\r\n-   gamepads: Res<Gamepads>,\r\n-   button_inputs:
