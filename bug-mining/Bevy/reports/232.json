The problem with this is that it relies on the fact that all of the reflected types so far have no private fields. Private fields are inaccessible from `bevy_reflect`, so this organizational choice places limitations indirectly on data in `bevy_math`. \r\n\r\nI ran into this limitation while working on curve-based animation.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\n`bevy_math` should provide its own `Reflect` implementations behind an optional dependency on `bevy_reflect`. This makes more sense practically and organizationally, since `bevy_math` actually owns those types and has access to their private data.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nMake all fields of all `bevy_math` types with `Reflect` public forever.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13456/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
