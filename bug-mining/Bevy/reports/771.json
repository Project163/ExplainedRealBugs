If one spawns and despawns lots of content, they continuously grow.\n\n### Entity Specialization Ticks\n\nThere's a similar problem with `EntitySpecializationTicks` ([2d](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3c9e696faa961ac01cec5933dcb4d16e653a5ecf/crates/bevy_sprite/src/mesh2d/material.rs#L548-L559) and [3d](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3c9e696faa961ac01cec5933dcb4d16e653a5ecf/crates/bevy_pbr/src/material.rs#L693-L704)).
