Objective\r\n\r\nIn my own project I was encountering the issue to find out which entities were spawned after applying commands. I began maintaining a vector of all entities with generational information before and after applying the command and diffing it. This was awfully complicated though and has no constant complexity but grows with the number of entities.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nLooking at `EntyMeta` it seemed obvious to me that struct can track the tick just as it does with `MaybeLocation`, updated from the same call. After that it became almost a given to also introduce query data `SpawnDetails` which offers methods to get the spawn tick and location, and query filter `Spawned` that filters entities out that were not spawned since the last run.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI expanded a few tests and added new ones, though maybe I forgot a group of tests that should be extended too. I basically searched `bevy_ecs` for mentions of `Changed` and `Added` to see where the tests and docs are.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks of spawn/despawn can be found [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19047#issuecomment-2852181374).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\nFrom the added docs, systems with equal complexity since the filter is not archetypal:\r\n```rs\r\nfn system1(q: Query<Entity, Spawned>) {\r\n    for entity in &q { /* entity spawned */ }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn system2(query: Query<(Entity, SpawnDetails)>) {\r\n    for (entity, spawned) in &query {\r\n        if spawned.is_spawned() { /* entity spawned */ }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`SpawnedDetails` has a few more methods:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nfn print_spawn_details(query: Query<(Entity, SpawnDetails)>) {\r\n    for (entity, spawn_details) in &query {\r\n        if spawn_details.is_spawned() {\r\n            print!(\"new \");\r\n        }\r\n        println!(\r\n            \"entity {:?} spawned at {:?} by {:?}\",\r\n            entity,\r\n            spawn_details.spawned_at(),\r\n            spawn_details.spawned_by()\r\n        );        \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nNo public api was changed, I only added to it. That is why I added no migration guide.\r\n\r\n- query data `SpawnDetails`\r\n- query filter `Spawned`\r\n- method `Entities::entity_get_spawned_or_despawned_at`\r\n- method `EntityRef::spawned_at`\r\n- method `EntityMut::spawned_at`\r\n- method `EntityWorldMut::spawned_at`\r\n- method `UnsafeEntityCell::spawned_at`\r\n- method `FilteredEntityRef::spawned_at`\r\n- method

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #21293\r\nFixes #17314 to ensure that this is tested correctly.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nwhen despawning an entity, previously the swapped in (archetype) or moved in entity (table) (which both require extra bookkeeping to update archetype or table rows) were marked as `spawned_or_despawned` by the location and tick that the to-be-removed entity was meant to be marked, while the to-be-removed entity wasn't marked.\r\nAs pointed out by @akimakinai in [#19047](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19047), I've re-added the correct `mark_spawn_despawn` call to `despawn_with_caller`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI've added a test `spawned_after_swap_remove` that ensures that despawning an entity by swapping doesn't effect other entities `spawned_or_despawned` location, and that it does effect the despawned entity's index's `spawned_or_despawned` location.\r\n\r\nCo-Authored By:
