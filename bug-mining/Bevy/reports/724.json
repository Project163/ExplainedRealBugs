Bevy version\n\n0.16.0-dev\n commit: ab38b610011cdb66afbfcc95a79f2d6db44edce8\n\n## What you did\n\nI've created a brand new project with `cargo new bevy-example`\nand added a bevy dependency to my Cargo.toml like so:\n\n```toml\n[package]\nname = \"bevy-example\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2024\"\n\n[dependencies]\nbevy = { git = \"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy.git\", rev = \"ab38b610011cdb66afbfcc95a79f2d6db44edce8\", default-features = false, features = [\"std\"] }\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\ndoing `cargo build` results in this compilation error:\n\n<img width=\"953\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cc33dc5-0b1c-4c53-9901-dd69ee071640\" />\n\n## Additional information\n\nI'm not sure if I can use bevy with feature `std` on it's own, but this issue persists even if I use features `std` and `async_executor`.\n\nYou can get this exact compilation error if you clone bevy and try to build it with this command:\n`cargo build --no-default-features --features std`\n\nI think this may be caused by #17955 :( (I've followed the migration guide for that change but that hasn't resolved my error)\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18200/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
