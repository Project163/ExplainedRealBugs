Bevy has great tools to accomplish this sort of coordination, but it is often hard to inspect.\n\nThe first attempt at improving runtime inspection was made in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/14034, which added optional tracking of exactly where every component is accessed or mutated, as an extension of the change detection system.
