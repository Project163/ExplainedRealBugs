Bevy version  \n0.15.1\n\n## Relevant system information  \nWindows 11\n\n```ignore\n`AdapterInfo { name: \"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070\", vendor: 4318, device: 7938, device_type: DiscreteGpu, backend: Vulkan }`\n```\n\n## What you did  \nWe stuff the `EventLoopProxy` into a static, so that we can wake the app remotely from a seperate thread\n\n## What went wrong\nThe systems do not wake under some conditions, such as dragging the window, or winit's `drag_resize_window`.\n\n## Additional information\nAppears to work ok on Linux.\nI am not entirely sure if this is a bevy issue, a winit issue, or a Win11 issue.\nOriginally reproduced for 14.2, updated to 15.1 and it is still possible to reproduce.\n\n## Minimal Repro\n```rust\n/*\n[dependencies]\nbevy = \"0.15.1\"\nbevy_winit =
