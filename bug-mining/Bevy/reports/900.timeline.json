give some context about the problem:\n`move_components` in `EntityCloner` works by using `EntityWorldMut::remove_by_ids`, but this drops the components' values. What we want is actually something like `EntityWorldMut::forget_by_ids` (not too difficult to implement). The real problem is that we would still (probably?) want to run remove hooks and observers on moved components. \nTo do that, `EntityWorldMut::forget_by_ids` would have to run these hooks just like `EntityWorldMut::remove_by_ids` does:\n1. copy component data from source\n2. call `forget_by_ids`\n3. insert component data into target\n\nHowever, hooks and observers can move data out of components, so after step 2 we might have invalid component data stored. Instead, the correct way to do it looks something like this:\n1. run remove hooks/observes\n2. copy component data from `source`\n3. call `forget_by_ids` without running any hooks/observers\n4. insert component data into `target`\n\nSo the question really is how to design such interface without having to reimplement most of `EntityWorldMut::remove_bundle`.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2690920909/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eugineerd","id":70062110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDYyMTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70062110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd","html_url":"https://github.com/eugineerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2692502916","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18079#issuecomment-2692502916","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18079","id":2692502916,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86gfFWE","user":{"login":"grind086","id":6655984,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTU5ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6655984?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086","html_url":"https://github.com/grind086","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-02T01:23:28Z","updated_at":"2025-03-02T01:23:28Z","body":"I noticed a couple of `TODO: BundleRemover?` comments and gave that a shot.

Objective\r\nFix #18079 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- `EntityCloner` can now move components that don't have `Clone` or `Reflect` implementation.\r\n- Components with `ComponentCloneBehavior::Ignore` will not be moved.\r\n- Components with `ComponentCloneBehavior::Custom` will be cloned using their defined `ComponentCloneFn` and then removed from the source entity to respect their `queue_deferred` logic.\r\n- Relationships still need to be `Clone` or `Reflect` to be movable.\r\n- Custom relationship data is now correctly preserved when cloned or moved using `EntityCloner`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Added new tests for moving
