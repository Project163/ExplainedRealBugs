However fixing that will likely involve changing how `ObserverSystem` is defined, since now the `Trigger` is expected to be the input of the underlying `System` and that's required to be `'static` (which likely was the orignal reason why the `Trigger<'static>` was used). The possibilities I see are:\r\n\r\n- `System` is somehow changed to support non-`'static` inputs (I did try this in the past in a local branch and it didn't seem trivial)\r\n- `ObserverSystem` is changed to not require `System`, and instead has its own implementations (essentially just moving the ones for `SystemParamFunction` with their first argument being `Trigger` over to `IntoObserverSystem`)\r\n\r\n> i.e. couldn't you leak the trigger instead and still cause UB?\r\n\r\nYes, for example `Box::leak(Box::new(trigger)).event()` will return a `&'static E`. Ultimately that's just another way to make the `trigger` escape the current function lifetime.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2314406061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SkiFire13","id":9020423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjA0MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9020423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13","html_url":"https://github.com/SkiFire13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"ItsDoot","id":9044780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDQ3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9044780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot","html_url":"https://github.com/ItsDoot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-13T07:21:24Z","updated_at":"2024-09-13T07:21:24Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15184","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15184/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15184/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15184/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15184","id":2524066569,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U857ZM8Q","number":15184,"title":"Support systems that take references as input","user":{"login":"ItsDoot","id":9044780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDQ3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9044780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot","html_url":"https://github.com/ItsDoot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":2287994822,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjg3OTk0ODIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Code-Quality","name":"C-Code-Quality","color":"B8B8B8","default":false,"description":"A section of code that is hard to understand or change"},{"id":2747857990,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODU3OTkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Usability","name":"C-Usability","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A targeted quality-of-life change that makes Bevy easier to use"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #14924\r\n- Closes #9584\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- We introduce a new trait, `SystemInput`, that serves as a type function from the `'static` form of the input, to its lifetime'd version, similarly to `SystemParam` or `WorldQuery`.\r\n- System functions now take the lifetime'd wrapped version, `SystemInput::Param<'_>`, which prevents the issue presented in #14924 (i.e. `InRef<T>`).\r\n- Functions for running systems now take the lifetime'd unwrapped version, `SystemInput::Inner<'_>` (i.e. `&T`).\r\n- Due to the above change, system piping had to be re-implemented as a standalone type, rather than `CombinatorSystem` as it was previously.\r\n- Removes the `Trigger<'static, E, B>` transmute in observer runner code.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- All current tests pass.\r\n- Added additional tests and doc-tests.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut world = World::new();\r\n\r\nlet mut value = 2;\r\n\r\n// Currently possible:\r\nfn square(In(input): In<usize>) -> usize {\r\n    input * input\r\n}\r\nvalue = world.run_system_once_with(value, square);\r\n\r\n// Now possible:\r\nfn square_mut(InMut(input): InMut<usize>) {\r\n    *input *= *input;\r\n}\r\nworld.run_system_once_with(&mut value, square_mut);\r\n\r\n// Or:\r\nfn square_ref(InRef(input): InRef<usize>) -> usize {\r\n    *input * *input\r\n}\r\nvalue = world.run_system_once_with(&value, square_ref);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- All current explicit usages of the following types must be changed in the way specified:\r\n    - `SystemId<I, O>` to `SystemId<In<I>, O>`\r\n    - `System<In = T>` to `System<In = In<T>>`\r\n    - `IntoSystem<I, O, M>` to `IntoSystem<In<I>, O, M>`\r\n    - `Condition<M, T>` to `Condition<M, In<T>>`\r\n- `In<Trigger<E, B>>` is no longer a valid input parameter type. Use `Trigger<E, B>` directly, instead.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15184/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":6,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15184/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14368234489,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86UMe-TzwAAAANYadv5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14368234489","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c7ec456e5073f3b7eaced1ed63b155355f2e574f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/c7ec456e5073f3b7eaced1ed63b155355f2e574f","created_at":"2024-09-23T17:58:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14368234645,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86UMe-TzwAAAANYadyV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14368234645","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-23T17:58:34Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
