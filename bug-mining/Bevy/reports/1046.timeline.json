Objective\r\n\r\nIn #21598 and the related Discord discussion, it was pointed out that the `async_compute` example promotes an inefficient and potentially error-prone pattern: `future::block_on(poll_once)`.\r\n\r\nIt is now recommended to use `bevy::tasks::futures::check_ready` instead, which is much cheaper and avoids blocking the main thread while waiting on the future. Another valid approach is to pass a channel into the async tasks and detach them, letting the channel handle task readiness.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements both suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n* **Updated `async_compute` example**\r\n  Replaced the use of `future::block_on(poll_once)` with the recommended `check_ready`.\r\n  The change is minimal and limited to the directly affected lines.\r\n\r\n* **Added new example: `async_channel_pattern`**\r\n  Demonstrates how to spawn async tasks using a channel-based communication pattern.\r\n\r\n  * Each task is executed on a separate thread via `AsyncComputeTaskPool`.\r\n  * Results (cube positions) are sent back through a `CubeChannel` once completed.\r\n  * Tasks are detached to run fully asynchronously, ensuring the main thread remains unblocked.\r\n  * A rotating light in the scene visually indicates that the frame loop remains responsive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am relatively new to both Bevy and async Rust, and I genuinely appreciate any feedback or suggestions to improve these examples — especially regarding idiomatic async patterns and best practices for Bevy task management.\r\n\r\nFixes #21598","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21647/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20566343722,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U87SXefBzwAAAATJ2YAq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20566343722","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1bd6f42719e61f15dec1252e5dd517ace136a803","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/1bd6f42719e61f15dec1252e5dd517ace136a803","created_at":"2025-10-28T23:01:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20566344133,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U87SXefBzwAAAATJ2YHF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20566344133","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-28T23:01:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
