Objective\r\n\r\nAdd a test that reproduces #18557. \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe test spawns several meshes, then every so often starts a new animation transition. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37ba6096-d9f1-47f8-875b-bb183d065321\r\n\r\nI'm a bit ambivalent about this test. It's quite limited, non-deterministic, and requires manual visual inspection. But it would have caught at least one bug, so maybe that's fine.\r\n\r\nThe name is debatable. I chose `test_animation_transitions` to make sure it's not confused with an example. Although it's maybe simple enough to be one - no other example shows how to manage multiple meshes playing different animations, and I suspect some people find that difficult to implement. But a real example should probably use keyboard controls instead of random timers.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18574/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17022458105,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86vxL1MzwAAAAP2nhj5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17022458105","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a7e6578733504b32ede0cfe95a062dbef4a4addc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/a7e6578733504b32ede0cfe95a062dbef4a4addc","created_at":"2025-03-27T21:54:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17022458303,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86vxL1MzwAAAAP2nhm_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17022458303","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-27T21:54:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17022497636,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86vxL1MzwAAAAP2nrNk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17022497636","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bf915012ff81702cc3171b617df0499241c93ebc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/bf915012ff81702cc3171b617df0499241c93ebc","created_at":"2025-03-27T21:59:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
