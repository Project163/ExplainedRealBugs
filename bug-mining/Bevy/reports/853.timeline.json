have a sneaking suspicion this comes in part from queued component registration . See [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3dc6a07d27e132ea81985809d0636da230cde320/crates/bevy_ecs/src/component.rs#L2439). This explains the 11x regression in `get_not_found`. We can fix it pretty easy with `Components::get_valid_id` instead of `get_id`, which now has atomic locking in it. \n\nI don't think this fully explains the regression for `get`/`get_mut`, but I wouldn't be surprised if they are related. \n\nFirst step is definitely benchmarks. I'd be curious if this went away with `Query` instead of `EntityWorldMut` and if we flush queued component registration before running the benches. If the flush helps, that would explain why the regression was not felt anywhere: the flush is called once per frame already.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2947648003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ElliottjPierce","id":79881080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODgxMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79881080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce","html_url":"https://github.com/ElliottjPierce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"re0312","id":45868716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODY4NzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45868716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312","html_url":"https://github.com/re0312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-06T01:46:31Z","updated_at":"2025-06-06T01:46:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19505","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19505/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19505/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19505/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19505","id":3123348986,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86ZUNkE","number":19505,"title":"Fix regression on the get/get_mut/get_not_found","user":{"login":"re0312","id":45868716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODY4NzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45868716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312","html_url":"https://github.com/re0312","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/re0312/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":2272098452,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjcyMDk4NDUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Performance","name":"C-Performance","color":"B8B8B8","default":false,"description":"A change motivated by improving speed, memory usage or compile times"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

registration queue. Probably don't even need this tbh; just trying to eliminate things.\n\n> EDIT: note that the code repeats the same benchmark many times, so if component registration only happens on the first call it likely only still has a small impact (but would still be good to eliminate).\n\nYes, I'm thinking in particularly about the 11x regression in `get_not_found`, which has a component that is not registered. When checking for unregistered components, it locks. If the component, `C2` in the bench, were registered head of time or we changed the `get_id` like I mentioned, this wouldn't be an issue. But right now, the bench locks when `.get::<C2>()` etc are called.\n\nI suspect that between this and #19505, these regressions will be fixed.\n\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2947814871/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ElliottjPierce","id":79881080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODgxMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79881080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce","html_url":"https://github.com/ElliottjPierce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElliottjPierce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2947837664","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19504#issuecomment-2947837664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19504","id":2947837664,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86vtG7g","user":{"login":"SanderMertens","id":9919222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MTkyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SanderMertens","html_url":"https://github.com/SanderMertens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SanderMertens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SanderMertens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SanderMertens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SanderMertens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SanderMertens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SanderMertens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SanderMertens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SanderMertens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SanderMertens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-06T02:19:25Z","updated_at":"2025-06-06T02:19:25Z","body":"@ElliottjPierce \n\n> Just call flush after the component is in the registration queue.

Objective\r\n\r\n- #19504 showed a 11x regression in getting component values for unregistered components. This pr should fix that and improve others a little too.\r\n- This is some cleanup work from #18173 .\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Whenever we expect a component value to exist, we only care about fully registered components, not queued to be registered components since, for the value to exist, it must be registered.\r\n- So we can use the faster `get_valid_*` instead of `get_*` in a lot of places.\r\n- Also found a bug where `valid_*` did not forward to `get_valid_*` properly. That's fixed.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nCI\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19510/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2950755825","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19504#issuecomment-2950755825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19504","id":2950755825,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86v4PXx","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-06T20:47:13Z","updated_at":"2025-06-06T20:47:13Z","body":"Merging the two linked PRs: we should re-bench once those are in.
