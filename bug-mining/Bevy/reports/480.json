If any `std` dependency is added (even transiently!), it will break this guarantee.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\n- Add one or more `no_std` targets to a specific `no_std` `cargo build` CI action. The most obvious platform would be `x86_64_unknown-none`, since Bevy is known to work on `x86_64` across many operating systems. However, more could be added based on community usage (e.g., Raspberry Pi, STM32, etc.). This would ensure it is possible to build Bevy and/or its crates without the `std` library being linked.\n- Add a test CI action which disables the `std` feature (and possibly `alloc` as well) to ensure unit tests pass in a `no_std` environment. Note that these tests can be run on a platform _with_ the `std` library, since the above test ensures that the `std` library isn't _used_ directly or transiently.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nWe could do nothing for now. Since the Bevy `no_std` community is just starting, there are currently no users to complain if `no_std` support is broken. \n\n","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15840/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
