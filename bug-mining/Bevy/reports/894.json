Users will expect a method with that name and signature to only evaluate the closure if needed, and will be surprised by the performance if it runs it immediately.  This similarly affects `or_try_insert_with`.  \n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nHave `EntityEntryCommands::or_insert_with` and `or_try_insert_with` only evaluate the closure if the component does not exist, matching the behavior of `ComponentEntry::or_insert_with`.  \n\nI believe the tricky part here is that `or_insert_with` works by using `insert_if_new`, which works in terms of bundles, but bundles don't have a way to hold unevaluated values.  \n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nIf that's difficult to implement, then we could simply the method and have users call `EntityEntryCommands::or_insert`, which makes the performance characteristics more obvious.  \n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19884/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19884/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
