Imagine a 3x3 display of monitors, each being rendered by a separate processor, but the 3d scene spans the entire array. Now say you want to render the top-left monitor: the camera position is still centered on the middle monitor, the view frustum for the top left monitor is \"sheared\".\r\n* Efficient rendering of portals - generally a portal will only want to render a small portion of the window (the 2d bounding box of the portal) to the render target, rather than rendering the entire screen, which would be slow.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nThe [setViewOffset()](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera.setViewOffset) API in three.js is fairly simple. It accepts six parameters:\r\n\r\n* fullWidth — full width of multiview setup\r\n* fullHeight — full height of multiview setup\r\n* x — horizontal offset of subcamera\r\n* y — vertical offset of subcamera\r\n* width — width of subcamera\r\n* height — height of subcamera\r\n\r\nAll this does is adjust the perspective projection, and the corresponding view frustum, to render a rectangular subregion of the normal frustum. This is not the same as a clip rect, the subregion is \"spread\" over the entire viewport rect.\r\n\r\nWhile it's possible that this feature already exists, I could not find it. I would expect that if it did exist, it would be a property of either Camera, Camera3DBundle, or ProjectionMatrix, but I could find nothing in those types relevant to this.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nI can't think of a workaround for this, other than rendering to a very large render target and then cutting out a small piece of it, which would destroy performance.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12488/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12488/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
