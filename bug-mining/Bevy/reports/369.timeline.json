I'm quite nervous about doubling the API surface there for some sugar 🤔 Is there a benefit that I'm missing?\r\n\r\nWell, I'm also nervous about it, but I think it's worth thinking about at least. My main thought here was mostly that the gizmo functions are essentially just indirectly asking for isometries as inputs — on the other hand, just changing the inputs to isometries seems like it could lead to poor ergonomics in cases where an isometry isn't readily on hand (since you'll have to call `Isometry3d::new` wrapping what you previously would have just passed as parameters). That's why I wrote \"in addition to\" above: I didn't really give much thought to the fact that that doubles the API surface, though. \r\n\r\nAs I write this, I'm becoming a little more skeptical that the \"from raw parts\" aspect will be typical if people are typically going to be extracting these from transforms, so maybe if the story for `Transform -> Isometry3d` is good, just taking isometries as inputs would be okay.

Objective\r\n\r\n- Solves the last bullet in and closes #14319\r\n- Make better use of the `Isometry` types\r\n- Prevent issues like #14655\r\n- Probably simplify and clean up a lot of code through the use of Gizmos as well (i.e. the 3D gizmos for cylinders circles & lines don't connect well, probably due to wrong rotations)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- go through the `bevy_gizmos` crate and give all methods a slight workover\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- For all the changed examples I run `git switch main && cargo rr --example <X> && git switch <BRANCH> && cargo rr --example <X>` and compare the visual results\r\n- Check if all doc tests are still compiling\r\n- Check the docs in general and update them !!! \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThe gizmos methods function signature changes as follows:\r\n\r\n- 2D\r\n  - if it took `position` & `rotation_angle` before -> `Isometry2d::new(position, Rot2::radians(rotation_angle))`\r\n  - if it just took `position` before -> `Isometry2d::from_translation(position)`\r\n- 3D\r\n  - if it took `position` & `rotation` before -> `Isometry3d::new(position, rotation)`\r\n  - if it just took `position` before -> `Isometry3d::from_translation(position)`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14676/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14037543833,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86PgSXvzwAAAANEs-uZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14037543833","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8895113784e58d4f9c220732aba8571eab8b5db3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/8895113784e58d4f9c220732aba8571eab8b5db3","created_at":"2024-08-28T01:53:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14037543930,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86PgSXvzwAAAANEs-v6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14037543930","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-28T01:53:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
