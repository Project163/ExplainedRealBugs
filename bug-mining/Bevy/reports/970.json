says:\r\n\r\nThis is a bit tangential to the scope of this PR, but I think it might be prudent to brand `bevy_ui_widgets` as \"experimental\" for a release, in the same vein as bevy_feathers:\r\n\r\n1. I'm still planning on advocating for using Observers instead of Callbacks in the next cycle. I think the existence of both concepts is unnecessary additional complexity. These are \"events\", and observers are Bevy's \"event handlers\".\r\n2. Currently we're in an awkward middle ground where you need to choose between polling systems (which isn't our API-end-game) or the ergonomics embarrassment that is the `standard_widgets_observers.rs` example (I actually think removing it makes sense, as we don't want to encourage people to adopt this pattern in its current form, and examples exist to show people patterns they should adopt). Billing the current state of things as \"ready\" / \"the full release\" doesn't feel great to me.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @cart in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/20944#discussion_r2337787383_\r\n            ","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20957/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20957/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
