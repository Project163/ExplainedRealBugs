changed `observe` to `observe_entity` to avoid scenarios where users would chain `world.observe(..).observe(..)` and unintentionally end up observing their observer. This is because `world.observe` is really more like `world.spawn_observer` than the similarly named `app.observe` which just returns `App`.\n\nHowever, the `observe_entity` name is a bit confusing or unintuitive in the case of `world.spawn(..).observe_entity(..)`, since it seems expected that after spawning an entity you'd observe that entity. The `_entity` suffix adds additional information here that could imply it's doing something other than the obvious, i.e. adds verbosity that actually reduces clarity in the name of preventing other confusion.\n\nPossible solutions:\n- Rename `observe` on `App` and `World` to something like `add_observer`.\n- Have `observe` return `&mut World` instead of `EntityWorldMut`.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
