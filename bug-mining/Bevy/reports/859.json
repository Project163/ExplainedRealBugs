However, I can't put a SpawnRelatedBundle into a field of a struct that I'm deriving Bundle for:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Bundle)]\npub struct EnemyDingusBundle {\n    pub identity: EnemyDingus,\n    pub script_state: SpawnRelatedBundle<ChildOf, Spawn<ScriptState>>\n}\n\nimpl EnemyDingusBundle {\n    fn new(script: Handle<Script>) -> Self {\n        Self {\n            identity: EnemyDingus,\n            script_state: Children::spawn(Spawn(ScriptState::root(script))),\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis gives an error like `the trait bound SpawnRelatedBundle<ChildOf, Spawn<SomeComponent>>: BundleFromComponents is not satisfied`.\n\nPutting the SpawnRelatedBundle _beside_ a derived bundle struct and wrapping them in a tuple bundle works fine, though: \n\n```rust\n#[derive(Bundle)]\npub struct EnemyDingusBundle {\n    pub identity: EnemyDingus,\n}\n\nimpl EnemyDingusBundle {\n  fn dingus_plus(script: ScriptState) -> impl Bundle {\n    (\n        Self { identity: EnemyDingus },\n        Children::spawn(Spawn(ScriptState::root(script))),\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt looks like bundles with bundle effects work as expected in tuple bundles because those have a manual/bespoke Bundle implementation, but the derive macro doesn't know what to do with them. \n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nSupport effectful bundles as fields of structs that derive `Bundle`, so that struct bundles have equal features to tuple bundles. \n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\n- Make do with tuple bundle wrappers instead of well-defined bundle structs. (Which is what I'm going forward with for now.)","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19136/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
