Objective\r\n\r\nSwitch to retained render world causes the extracted cameras in render world to not be removed until camera in main world is despawned. When extracting data from main world inactive cameras are skipped. Therefore camera that was active and became inactive has a retained `ExtractedCamera` component from previous frames (when it was active) and is processed the same way as if it were active (there is no `active` field on `ExtractedCamera`). This breakes switching between cameras in `render_primitives` example.\r\nFixes #15822\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nFix it by removing `ExtractedCamera` and related components from inactive cameras.\r\nNote that despawning inactive camera seems to be bad option because they are spawned using `SyncToRenderWorld` component.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nSwitching camera in `render_primitives` example now works
