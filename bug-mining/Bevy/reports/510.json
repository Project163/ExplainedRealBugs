This is extremely visible with rounded borders, as the rounding gets distorted and remain fully on screen.\r\n\r\n- what were you expecting?\r\n\r\nNode should be clipped\r\n\r\n- what actually happened?\r\n\r\nNode get squished.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nThis is with flex shrink: 0. I think rendering uses the visible clip rect as if it was the full UV 0-1 range, rather than clamping the UV to the visible portion.\r\n\r\nThe effect is clearly visible on the radio buttons in the gif below, but also notice the button corners remaining on-screen as well:\r\n\r\n![border_radius_squish](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f307c6de-2d62-4069-be91-2bf3539a2291)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15502/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
