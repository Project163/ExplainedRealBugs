These requirements are scattered across bevy_ecs, leading to \"copy-paste an existing executor\" as the only sensible strategy.\n\nSimilarly, when attempting to make changes to this code, engine devs need to go and carefully manually implement these changes across multiple call sites, being sure to maintain consistency.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nMore behavior should be moved out of `SystemExecutor::run`, and into new methods on the `SystemExecutor` trait. Ideally, `SystemExecutor::run`'s default implementation can call all of these submethods in order to achieve the correct behavior.\n\nAdditionally, `evaluate_and_fold_conditions` should be moved out into a public helper and reused across executors.","closed_by":{"login":"james7132","id":3137680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzc2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132","html_url":"https://github.com/james7132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18453/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
