(I describe it in my book).\n\nFeature gating as you have done is not very fine grained and/or is lots of work.\n\nI think users are better off just filtering out the logs they don't care about and selectively re-enabling.\n\nIts fairly straight forward to filter out library code.\n\nTo quote some document changes I will propose once 0.15 is released.\n\n> For a quick setup that enables all your loggings,while not showing all your dependencies log data\n> you can configuere the plugin as below.\n>\n> ```rs no_run\n> fn main() {\n>     App::new()\n>         .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.set(LogPlugin {\n>             filter: \"warn,my_crate=trace\".to_string(), //specific filters\n>             level: Level::TRACE,//Change this to be globally change

book.\n(my proposed documentation changes will not reference my book.)\n\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2445907004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Lyndon-Mackay","id":31716003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzE2MDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31716003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay","html_url":"https://github.com/Lyndon-Mackay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"Lyndon-Mackay","id":31716003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzE2MDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31716003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay","html_url":"https://github.com/Lyndon-Mackay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyndon-Mackay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-21T00:25:58Z","updated_at":"2024-11-21T00:25:58Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16455","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16455/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16455/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16455/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/16455","id":2677618265,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86CmKtV","number":16455,"title":"Basic
