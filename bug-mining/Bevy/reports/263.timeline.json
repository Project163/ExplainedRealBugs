Objective\r\n\r\nReading system information severely slows down the update loop.\r\nFixes #12848.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nRead system info in a separate thread.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Open the scene 3d example\r\n-  Add `FrameTimeDiagnosticsPlugin`, `SystemInformationDiagnosticsPlugin` and `LogDiagnosticsPlugin` to the app.\r\n- Add this system to the update schedule to disable Vsync on the main window\r\n```rust\r\nfn change_window_mode(mut windows: Query<&mut Window, Added<Window>>) {\r\n    for mut window in &mut windows {\r\n        window.present_mode = PresentMode::AutoNoVsync;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Read the fps values in the console before and after this PR.\r\n\r\nOn my PC I went from around 50 fps to around 1150 fps.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- The `SystemInformationDiagnosticsPlugin` now reads system data separate of the update cycle.\r\n\r\n### Added \r\n\r\n-  The `EXPECTED_SYSTEM_INFORMATION_INTERVAL` constant which defines how often we read system diagnostic data.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13693/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13693/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13106429067,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86EW_zxzwAAAAMNNDyL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13106429067","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f187d9c5fc771f6da863ed2810bb83c2e225a9c2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/f187d9c5fc771f6da863ed2810bb83c2e225a9c2","created_at":"2024-06-10T19:22:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13106429225,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86EW_zxzwAAAAMNND0p","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13106429225","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-10T19:22:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13107089157,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86EW_zxzwAAAAMNPk8F","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13107089157","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7cd90990f971d47fd75d1ed3563a8afc1067f3a7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/7cd90990f971d47fd75d1ed3563a8afc1067f3a7","created_at":"2024-06-10T20:31:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
