Commonly, this process is masked from users, using loading screens.\r\n\r\nWe should teach users how to do this in Bevy.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n\r\n- use a simple state to track asset loading state: `Loading` vs `FullyLoaded`\r\n- spawn some assets in a scene\r\n- show a loading screen to users before assets are loaded\r\n- swap to that scene once (but not before) all assets are loaded\r\n\r\nStretch goals:\r\n\r\n- animate the loading screen\r\n- show progress on the loading screen\r\n- transition between multiple levels (may require #11426 to do nicely), unloading assets from the old level as you do so\r\n- wait for shader pipelines to compile too\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nA more dynamic asset loading solution can work better for e.g. open world games, but is more complex to implement and optimize.\r\n\r\nWe could also implement a first-party solution for this, but I suspect that the complexity will not be high enough to warrant it and the added flexibility / transparency of doing this as an example will be better.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n[bevy_asset_loader](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_asset_loader) is a more sophisticated tool for this. You can see a simple implementation of this pattern [in my archived game Emergence](https://github.com/Leafwing-Studios/Emergence/blob/1dc8ab5050739f8047f24c7a3f60ab091cd46888/emergence_lib/src/asset_management/mod.rs#L53).
