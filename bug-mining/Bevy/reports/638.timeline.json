I seem to recall that the \"could not access system parameter\" error is what happens when you try to inject a Resource that doesn't exist.\n\nThing is, the `InputFocus` resource is supposed to be optional - that is, if your game doesn't use input focus, then you shouldn't be required to initialize it or even depend on the `bevy_input_focus` crate. However, a11y now depends on `bevy_input_focus`, so anyone who installs the a11y plugin needs to have that resource initialized (either that, or we change a11y to injection that resource optionally).\n\nThe plugin which registers the `InputFocus` resource also installs a number of observers and a system which people may not want. These handle the bubbling of keyboard and button events. If you aren't using bubbling, then you shouldn't have to install these.\n\nThe \"right\" solution here would be to have a system of plugin dependencies: that is, a11y could depend on just the parts of bevy input focus that it needs, and users could depend on the parts they need, and if both a11y and the user installed the same plugins they would be deduped.

yet.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2568543426/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"viridia","id":1166135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia","html_url":"https://github.com/viridia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"ChristopherBiscardi","id":551247,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTI0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/551247?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi","html_url":"https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherBiscardi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-14T02:33:27Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T02:33:27Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17227","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17227/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17227/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17227/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17227","id":2774223755,"node_id":"I_kwDODf6-U86lW0uL","number":17227,"title":"`window_settings`
