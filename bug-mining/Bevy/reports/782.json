to 0.16\n\n## What went wrong\n\nAfter updating to 0.16 some meshes from gltf models began to intermittently appear and disappear. I also saw some other glitches (#18542 ) which may or may not have the same root cause. In my full game the flickering meshes seem to respond to camera motion. They will be present when the camera is in one position and absent in another. Changing window size also seems to trigger the flicker. In the attached minimal example there is no camera motion but the missing meshes are repeatably missing. In my full game I have seen this issue when running directly on wayland and also under xwayland but in the minimal example I have only gotten it to reproduce when running directly in wayland.\n\n## Additional information\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdd79524-6b37-4d68-88a1-e33d623b4c6f)\n\nThis screenshot demonstrates the issue. All the eyes are the same gltf model, the only difference is the x-y coordinates they were spawned at. There is a clear pattern in which ones are missing the eyelids and which ones aren't which wasn't noticable in the program this was extracted from, likely because things in that version are spawned in a more or less random order.\n\nA minimal example that reproduces the issue for me when run on wayland is attached.\n\n\n[example.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19456911/example.zip)","closed_by":{"login":"superdump","id":302146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump","html_url":"https://github.com/superdump","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18550/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18550/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
