So an easy fix here would be to use a thread local instead of a `static`, though the better fix really would be to not cache anything inside globals in the first place.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2566271677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Veykril","id":3757771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NTc3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3757771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Veykril","html_url":"https://github.com/Veykril","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Veykril/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Veykril/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Veykril/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Veykril/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Veykril/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Veykril/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Veykril/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Veykril/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Veykril/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15794772826,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86knBkIzwAAAAOtcRta","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15794772826","actor":{"login":"raldone01","id":27293675,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjkzNjc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27293675?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/raldone01","html_url":"https://github.com/raldone01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raldone01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raldone01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raldone01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raldone01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raldone01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raldone01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raldone01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raldone01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/raldone01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8262957ac56e21d4197f5f5409cba88f586dbcdc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ink-feather-org/cargo-manifest-proc-macros-rs/commits/8262957ac56e21d4197f5f5409cba88f586dbcdc","created_at":"2025-01-01T23:03:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
