Discussed in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/10381\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **Litttlefish** November  5, 2023</sup>\r\nToday I updated bevy to 0.12, and after migration I found this weird UI displacement\r\n![图片](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/38809254/ce781539-3bec-4d90-97a5-31098fd96ffa)\r\nIn 0.11, the ui works perfectly.\r\n![图片](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/38809254/b85aba30-04b4-4db6-a1e9-4470d747f520)\r\n\r\nIt happens when window resizes, also it seems that the displacement sometimes will change depending on resolution and presumably UiScale\r\nOn maximum(UiScale is about 1.9)\r\n![image-4](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/38809254/5dd014c0-df29-48e2-80b3-ab6b485f7dbf)\r\nOn fullscreen(UiScale is 2.0)\r\n![image-5](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/38809254/420332ca-7eea-426c-8651-08e4b3ee6140)</div>\r\n\r\nAnd I made a minimal reproduce code\r\n\r\nfor sprite, any 16:9 image is ok\r\nand maximize it after run to see the bug at the right side\r\n\r\nShould look like this\r\n![图片](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/38809254/b00e432b-7650-4259-a155-b8d437d92508)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the right side has one pixel missing\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse
