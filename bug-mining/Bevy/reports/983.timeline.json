Objective\r\n\r\n- When you `clone_and_spawn` a Mesh3D, you get a duplicate in the VisibilityClass Component. This is especially noticable with transaparent materials.\r\n- Fixes #20884\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- To avoid this duplicate case, I added a simple guard check to avoid adding a duplicate record. According to the documentation, there is rarely a case where there is more than one VisibilityClass. That said, there is probably a better option to fix it, but I didn't want to destroy performance or make a massive change to the underlying data structures.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- There is some unit testing to cover this case\r\n- This was visually tested as well as verifying using `bevy_inspector_egui`\r\n\r\nBefore the fix:\r\n<img width=\"178\" height=\"202\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f8685f6-fbc3-4bc1-b9bd-7e28177cc901\" />\r\n\r\nAfter the fix: \r\n<img width=\"120\" height=\"173\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bafd5e4a-69be-4249-894a-5f03dfe28b63\" />\r\n\r\nSorry for the janky screenshots\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20891/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"it-me-joda","id":16933164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTMzMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16933164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda","html_url":"https://github.com/it-me-joda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-15T21:56:57Z","updated_at":"2025-09-15T21:56:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21069","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21069/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21069/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21069/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/21069","id":3419644881,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86oue9H","number":21069,"title":"Guard against VisibilityClass being duplicated while cloning","user":{"login":"it-me-joda","id":16933164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTMzMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16933164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda","html_url":"https://github.com/it-me-joda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-me-joda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619323,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Bug","name":"C-Bug","color":"d73a4a","default":false,"description":"An unexpected or incorrect behavior"},{"id":2045383863,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQ1MzgzODYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-Rendering","name":"A-Rendering","color":"C6A751","default":false,"description":"Drawing game state to the screen"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.
