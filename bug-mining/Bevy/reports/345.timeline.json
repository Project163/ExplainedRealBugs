Therefore Observers are a better fit.\r\n* Move away from `Startup` in favor of `OnEnter(State)`\r\n  - OnEnter now runs before Startup, making Startup kind of in an awkward API point\r\n  - https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/0-13-to-0-14/#onenter-state-schedules-now-run-before-startup-schedules\r\n* Introduce ScalingMode\r\n  - This allows defining some space for the UI and introduces the idea that a camera has a transform\r\n* Use a new font.\r\n  - There is a default font, but most people will want to change that, so use one.\r\n* button tinting has changed\r\n\r\n## Known Issues in 0.14\r\n\r\n* Padding is kind of buggy:
