Average: leads to fairly surprising behavior, non-associative.\r\n2. Use the left-hand alpha: fairly surprising, non-commutative.\r\n3. Set the alpha to 1: very surprising, associative and commutative.\r\n4. Don't support adding colors with alpha: panic, remove the implementation, or create a set of alpha-free colors.\r\n5. [Just add and subtract alpha like RGB](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12163#discussion_r1507793882): simple, but leads to values outside of 0-1.0 very easily.\r\n6. [Apply alpha blending](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12163#discussion_r1507810743): a little more expensive, probably well-behaved.
