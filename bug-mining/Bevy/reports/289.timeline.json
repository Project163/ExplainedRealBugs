Objective\r\n\r\nIn Bevy 0.13, `BackgroundColor` simply tinted the image of any `UiImage`. This was confusing: in every other case (e.g. Text), this added a solid square behind the element. #11165 changed this, but removed `BackgroundColor` from `ImageBundle` to avoid confusion, since the semantic meaning had changed.\r\n\r\nHowever, this resulted in a serious UX downgrade / inconsistency, as this behavior was no longer part of the bundle (unlike for `TextBundle` or `NodeBundle`), leaving users with a relatively frustrating upgrade path.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, adding both `BackgroundColor` and `UiImage` resulted in a bizarre effect, where the background color was seemingly ignored as it was covered by a solid white placeholder image.\r\n\r\nFixes #13969.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nPer @viridia's design:\r\n\r\n> - if you don't specify a background color, it's transparent.\r\n> - if you don't specify an image color, it's white (because it's a multiplier).\r\n> - if you don't specify an image, no image is drawn.\r\n> - if you specify both a background color and an image color, they are independent.\r\n> - the background color is drawn behind the image (in whatever pixels are transparent)\r\n\r\nAs laid out by @benfrankel, this involves:\r\n\r\n1. Changing the default `UiImage` to use a transparent texture but a pure white tint.\r\n2. Adding `UiImage::solid_color` to quickly set placeholder images.\r\n3. Changing the default `BorderColor` and `BackgroundColor` to transparent.\r\n4. Removing the default overrides for these values in the other assorted UI bundles.\r\n5. Adding `BackgroundColor` back to `ImageBundle` and `ButtonBundle`.\r\n6. Adding a 1x1 `Image::transparent`, which can be accessed from `Assets<Image>` via the `TRANSPARENT_IMAGE_HANDLE` constant.\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to everyone who helped out with the design in the linked issue and [the Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1255209923890118697/1255209999278280844): this was very much a joint design.\r\n\r\n@cart helped me figure out how to set the UiImage's default texture to a transparent 1x1 image, which is a much nicer fix.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI've checked  the examples modified by this PR, and the `ui` example as well just to be sure.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- `BackgroundColor` no longer tints the color of images in `ImageBundle` or `ButtonBundle`. Set `UiImage::color` to tint images instead.\r\n- The default texture for `UiImage` is now a transparent white square.  Use `UiImage::solid_color` to quickly draw debug images.\r\n-  The default value for `BackgroundColor` and `BorderColor` is now transparent.
