What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nOne of the common causes of hard-to-diagnose issues i see people having is having the wrong RenderAssetUsages set. Most of the time the issue is silent, making it hard to figure out why things aren't working.\n\nExamples:\n- https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19207 which is a more specific feature request that could be covered by this\n- https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19102\n- https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17987\n- https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/15172\n- https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1380027984823455816\n- https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/937158127491633152/1380049315887841310\n- https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1382751438110851212\n- https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/1385132782514344038\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\n#19207 is a good step, but it only covers one of many places where this issue could occur.\n- only affects picking\n- only affects Mesh\n\nI think one solution could look like this:\nDon't fully remove the handle from Assets in [extract_render_asset](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/crates/bevy_render/src/render_asset.rs#L287). Either leave a marker in its place, or store the handle separately. This would likely require a method `Assets::remove_with_reason` or similar. Then, in the various methods for getting the asset data, log out a warning if one of those handles has been requested. Probably should be `warn_once!` or maybe a smarter thing based on `track_caller` where its logged once for each caller.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nAnd abundance of documentation and materials could also somewhat alleviate this, but thats far from ideal.\nAnother option could be to make Assets::get return a Result instead of a Option, allowing it to report a reason why it failed, though that assumes people don't just let-else the Err into oblivion.\n\n## Additional context\n\nnone so far","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19737/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19737/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
