Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #18790.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdding schedule build setting clears all configurations regarding edges ignoring deferred parameters until then:\r\n- If the new setting has `auto_insert_apply_deferred = true` then currently the setting gets overwritten with an empty set of ignoring edges.\r\n- If the new setting has `auto_insert_apply_deferred = false` then currently the ignoring edges are lost even when re-enabling the build pass.\r\n\r\nThe fix is that build passes are never removed or overwritten, only combined with new values or simply disabled. I think this follows the idea of #11094.\r\n\r\nThe implementation makes use of rust's `1.86` down-casting that is properly brought into the bevy code by #18984 so it might make sense to merge that one first before this PR.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\nInstead of this PR, there are three other ways to solve the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Just point out in the docs that `set_build_pass` should not be used after configurations were added. This could be enforced with an assertion that panics.\r\n2. Make build passes independent to the configurations that are currently in the schedule. They instead pull the information they need during building. This requires then another collection in the graph that keeps the pass-specific dependencies around so they can be applied when building, not when added.\r\n3. Just check if the currently `auto_insert_apply_deferred` is already true and in this case do not add the pass which is only a solution for this specific pass in particular, but a very simple one.\r\n\r\nSo far I explored only 2. and found it too complex for a bug fix where there is no use case yet that requires passes to see dependencies only at build time. For 1. it seems not better than now except the problem causes a panic. I likely will check 3. soon.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI added a new test. I am not sure if you like that it is more like 3 tests in one but I did not want to pollute the module with the types for this \"single\" test. But I can split it up if wanted.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nAdded one: [rendered](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/217d614bc8c38239868c20531e941348952fde1d/release-content/migration-guides/schedule-build-pass-disabling.md)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"urben1680","id":55257931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjU3OTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55257931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680","html_url":"https://github.com/urben1680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-15T19:03:33Z","updated_at":"2025-05-15T19:03:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19217","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19217/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19217/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19217/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19217","id":3067151664,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86WYJUY","number":19217,"title":"No schedule build pass overwrite if build settings do not change `auto_insert_apply_deferred` from `true`","user":{"login":"urben1680","id":55257931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjU3OTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55257931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680","html_url":"https://github.com/urben1680","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urben1680/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619323,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Bug","name":"C-Bug","color":"d73a4a","default":false,"description":"An unexpected or incorrect behavior"},{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #18790.\r\nSimpler alternative to #19195.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAs suggested by @PixelDust22, simply avoid overwriting the pass if the schedule already has auto sync points enabled.\r\nLeave pass logic untouched.\r\n\r\nIt still is probably a bad idea to add systems/set configs before changing the build settings, but that is not important as long there are no more complex build passes.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAdded a test.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19217/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17818928632,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86x78vrzwAAAAQmF0X4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17818928632","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b92c0ebd3d6b2f5c5bc45287c19ac47326a73258","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/b92c0ebd3d6b2f5c5bc45287c19ac47326a73258","created_at":"2025-05-26T19:47:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17818928755,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86x78vrzwAAAAQmF0Zz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17818928755","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-26T19:47:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17891984481,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86x78vrzwAAAAQqcgRh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17891984481","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1126949807fc8a403604744ece9e3be929c43494","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/1126949807fc8a403604744ece9e3be929c43494","created_at":"2025-05-30T21:29:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
