the better solution anymore.\n\nPro for method syntax:\n\n- It is more aligned with what you'd usually write: first number, then unit (10px, 20.5%)\n\nContra for method syntax:\n\n- `20.5.percent()` looks a bit confusing (too many dots)\n- Using a method kind of conveys the meaning of transforming the number\n- the methods will always be available in the autocomplete\n- Numbers are literals, they shouldn't be treated as objects in this case (well, theoretically)\n\nPro for function syntax:\n\n- Looks very natural/intuitive. This would be the first thing, someone thinks of\n- The meaning of a number stays the same, it doesn't immediately look like it's being transformed\n\nContra for function syntax:\n\n- The order of number and unit is reversed; might make it seem a bit less natural\n\nBut regarding the comment from cart I just linked above, I think we should just stick to the function syntax and finalize and merge the linked
