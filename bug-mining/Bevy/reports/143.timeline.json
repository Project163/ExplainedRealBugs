soundtrack example, fade-in and fade-out features, added new assets, and updated credits.\r\n\r\n# Objective\r\n- Fixes #12651 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- Created a resource to hold the track list. \r\n- The audio assets are then loaded by the asset server and added to the track list. \r\n- Once the game is in a specific state, an `AudioBundle` is spawned and plays the appropriate track. \r\n- The audio volume starts at zero and is then incremented gradually until it reaches full volume.\r\n- Once the game state changes, the current track fades out, and a new one fades in at the same time, offering a relatively seamless transition.\r\n- Once a track is completely faded out, it is despawned from the app.\r\n- Game state changes are simulated through a `Timer` for simplicity.\r\n- Track change system is only run if there is a change in the `GameState` resource.\r\n- All tracks are used according to their respective licenses.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12774/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":3,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12774/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12298297095,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86DTgMHzwAAAALdCR8H","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12298297095","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"df76fd4a1b818add7e31cba2318d00a233392b30","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/df76fd4a1b818add7e31cba2318d00a233392b30","created_at":"2024-03-29T20:46:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12298297172,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86DTgMHzwAAAALdCR9U","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12298297172","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-29T20:46:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15078258835,"node_id":"PVTISC_lADODf6-U86DTgMHzwAAAAOCu_iT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15078258835","actor":{"login":"github-project-automation[bot]","id":113052574,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBr0Lng","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/235829?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-project-automation","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-project-automation%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"project_v2_item_status_changed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-29T20:46:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
