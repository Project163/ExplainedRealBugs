Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #13097 and other issues preventing the motion blur example from working on wasm\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Use a vec2 for padding\r\n- Fix error initializing the `MotionBlur` struct on wasm+webgl2\r\n- Disable MSAA on wasm+webgl2\r\n- Fix `GlobalsUniform` padding getting added on the shader side for webgpu builds\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nThe motion blur example now runs, but with artifacts. In addition to the obvious black artifacts, the motion blur or dithering seem to just look worse in a way I can't really describe. That may be expected.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAdapterInfo { name: \"ANGLE (Apple, ANGLE Metal Renderer: Apple M1 Max, Unspecified Version)\", vendor: 4203, device: 0, device_type: IntegratedGpu, driver: \"\", driver_info: \"\", backend: Gl }\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"1276\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-04-25 at 6 51 21 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/200550/65401d4f-92fe-454b-9dbc-a2d89d3ad963\">\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13099/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12779439919,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86G5kmLzwAAAAL5tscv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12779439919","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2fd432c463b3f02ee39c3ab3a47b8fa8c56c0689","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/2fd432c463b3f02ee39c3ab3a47b8fa8c56c0689","created_at":"2024-05-12T21:17:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12779439947,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86G5kmLzwAAAAL5tsdL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12779439947","actor":{"login":"james7132","id":3137680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzc2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132","html_url":"https://github.com/james7132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-12T21:17:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
