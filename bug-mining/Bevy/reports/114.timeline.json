Objective\r\n\r\nfix #12344\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nuse existing machinery in track_assets to determine if the asset is unused before firing Asset::Unused event\r\n\r\n~~most extract functions use `AssetEvent::Removed` to schedule deletion of render world resources. `RenderAssetPlugin` was using `AssetEvent::Unused` instead.\r\n`Unused` fires when the last strong handle is dropped, even if a new one is created. `Removed` only fires when a new one is not created.\r\nas far as i can see, `Unused` is the same as `Removed` except for this \"feature\", and that it also fires early if all handles for a loading asset are dropped (`Removed` fires after the loading completes). note that in that case, processing based on `Loaded` won't have been done anyway.\r\ni think we should get rid of `Unused` completely, it is not currently used anywhere (except here, previously) and i think using it is probably always a mistake.\r\ni also am not sure why we keep loading assets that have been dropped while loading, we should probably drop the loader task as well and remove immediately.~~","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12459/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12144134405,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86BeLLpzwAAAALT2MkF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12144134405","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"36cfb2170f18d0c48ae0b8f86bf0ae89a8a9a9e4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/36cfb2170f18d0c48ae0b8f86bf0ae89a8a9a9e4","created_at":"2024-03-17T21:52:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12144134431,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86BeLLpzwAAAALT2Mkf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12144134431","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-17T21:52:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12159925105,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86BeLLpzwAAAALUybtx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12159925105","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a66bdd074f04908cb8757ae10670a7205dfb974a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/a66bdd074f04908cb8757ae10670a7205dfb974a","created_at":"2024-03-18T21:51:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13810823659,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86BeLLpzwAAAAM3MHHr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13810823659","actor":{"login":"Wabtey","id":73140258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMTQwMjU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73140258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wabtey","html_url":"https://github.com/Wabtey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wabtey/followers","follo
