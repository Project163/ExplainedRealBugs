Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #16406.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `#[require(...)]` attribute internally registers component requirements using `register_required_components_manual`. This is done recursively in a way where every requirement in the \"inheritance tree\" is added into a flat `RequiredComponents` hash map with component constructors and inheritance depths stored.\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not consider runtime requirements: if a plugin has already registered `C` as required by `B`, and a component `A` requires `B` through the macro attribute, spawning an entity with `A` won't add `C`. The `required_by` hash set for `C` doesn't have `A`, and the `RequiredComponents` of `A` don't have `C`.\r\n\r\nIntuitively, I would've thought that the macro attribute's requirements were always added *before* runtime requirements, and in that case I believe this shouldn't have been an issue. But the macro requirements are based on `Component::register_required_components`, which in a lot of cases (I think) is only called *after* the first time a bundle with the component is inserted. So if a runtime requirement is defined *before* this (as is often the case, during `Plugin::build`), the macro may not take it into account.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nRegister requirements inherited from the `required` component in `register_required_components_manual_unchecked`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI added a test, essentially the same as in #16406, and it now passes. I also ran some of the tests in #16409, and they seem to work as expected. All the existing tests for required components

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #16406 ([Cart's comment](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16406#issuecomment-2481613994))\r\n\r\n#16410 fixed one critical bug with runtime requirements, but there's still another problem: If `A` requires `B`, `B` requires `C`, and `C` requires `D` (several levels of nesting), adding `A` won't add `D`!\r\n\r\nTurns out, this is just a trivial oversight with how the `required_by` lists are updated. When `C` requires `D`, only `C` is added to the list of components that require `D`. However, `A` and `B` should also be added, as they also indirectly require `D` through `C`.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nTraverse up the inheritance tree and add all requirees to the `required_by` list of the component being required. We actually already do this traversal to handle inherited requirements, so this adds no extra iteration or recursion.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI added [Cart's test](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16406#issuecomment-2481613994) that was previously
