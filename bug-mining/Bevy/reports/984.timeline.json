This was caused by incorrectly dropping a future.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAwait the future instead of dropping it.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21079#issuecomment-3295174637. @rparrett has indicated this resolves the issue. I have not personally tested it.\r\n\r\nWe need to figure out a better solution to unit test the web. This would be very easy to test, except that it requires `web_bindgen_futures` and has to run in a browser environment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21096/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21096/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19737728324,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U87L3UTFzwAAAASYddVE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19737728324","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b1b9d76864f780f9709b161f80cfd5b323032f7a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/b1b9d76864f780f9709b161f80cfd5b323032f7a","created_at":"2025-09-16T23:43:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19737728402,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U87L3UTFzwAAAASYddWS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19737728402","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-16T23:43:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19823765909,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U87L3UTFzwAAAASdlqmV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19823765909","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b6e87dc75cbeb795bb3bbbd51fd31770d58ad000","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/b6e87dc75cbeb795bb3bbbd51fd31770d58ad000","created_at":"2025-09-21T19:06:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
