Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #18212 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis solution updates bundles containing the component that gets additionally required components registered via `World::register_required_components` & friends.\r\n\r\nI also added a method to `Bundles` to iterate `BundleInfo` that contain a certain `ComponentId`. Needed for the implementation, might be useful for users.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAdded a new test. Also ran `insert_simple` benchmark to bench bundle registering:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cd9a579-6798-457f-8b08-5a9a0d4f0bf8)\r\n\r\n`base` spawns 10k entities at once, so the bundle registration has more impact than `unbatched` where the registration happens once for 10k spawns.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is too hot and needs more optimization?\r\n\r\nIt could be improved by simply have no additional field in `Bundles`. I guess that would bring bundle registration performance to main. But that also means a _much_ more expensive search to update bundles as I would need to iterate every `BundleInfo` and do a linear search on its contributed components.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19852/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"SkiFire13","id":9020423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjA0MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9020423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13","html_url":"https://github.com/SkiFire13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-06T12:51:41Z","updated_at":"2025-07-06T12:51:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19976","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19976/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19976/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19976/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19976","id":3206501271,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86doUMZ","number":19976,"title":"Fix

I suggest reviewing commit-by-commit\r\n\r\n# Objective\r\n\r\n- Fix #19863\r\n- Clean up a bit how recursive required components registration works\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Update required components registration to be oblivious of the recursive registration happening.\r\n- Concretely this means removing the `requiree`, `inheritance_depth` and `recursion_check_stack` parameters from `Component::register_required_components`\r\n  - `requiree` was effectively unused\r\n  - `inheritance_depth` is now useless, because the depth is always either 0 (for direct requirements) or computed in `register_inherited_required_components` by bumping the depth of the inherited components\r\n  - `recursion_check_stack` has been moved to `ComponentsRegistrator`, which also allows to make `enforce_no_required_components_recursion` private.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Existing tests pass\r\n- A test has been updated to catch the issue from

Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #19863 by removing `inheritance_depth`\r\n- Fixed #19333 by properly using depth-first order priority \r\n- Helps with #19300 (not sure if it could be closed with this PR)\r\n- Fixes #20173\r\n- Overall, fix the weird situation that required components are in, where some operations respect a depth-first order priority while other respect a breadth-first order priority.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Switch everything to a depth-first order priority as @cart originally intended it.\r\n- Effectively revert #18028, which tried to give priority to components with higher inheritance depth (i.e. with a breadth-first order priority).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nMost existing tests pass, except a couple that were removed due to testing inheritance depth or the breadth-first order priority that this PR will remove.\r\n\r\nSome tests were also added, some of which as regression tests and others to add more coverage.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18887027017,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U8695-xgzwAAAARlwSlJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18887027017","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-29T21:14:12Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Review","color":"D876E3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18887088534,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U8695-xgzwAAAARlwhmW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18887088534","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"45c997c45ff740a918fb74d5013d00b0b846b571","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/45c997c45ff740a918fb74d5013d00b0b846b571","created_at":"2025-07-29T21:18:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18887088698,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U8695-xgzwAAAARlwho6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18887088698","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-29T21:18:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18911189497,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U8695-xgzwAAAARnMdn5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18911189497","actor":{"login":"tychedelia","id":10366310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzY2MzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10366310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia","html_url":"https://github.com/tychedelia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tychedelia/followers","follo
