\nthis must be some kind of race condition. \n\nI was able to reproduce the flicker on a simple example:\n- I spawn three cubes in a setup_system and I try to let one of the outer cubes (left or right) flicker\n- In a system in the Update schedule\n    - I retrieve mutable references to the meshes left and right (and i read them just to make sure the compiler does not optimize away any dead code)\n    - I update/overwrite the mesh in the middle (alternating between a cube and a capsule)\n    - Note1: I do this each second but then several times in a row (`if time.elapsed_secs() % 1.0 < 0.1 {`), but I am not sure if this is 100% needed. I got the flicker reproduced this way.\n    - Note2: I do need to force the AssetServer to remove the old middle mesh (`meshes.remove(debug_resource.middle_mesh.id());`) to see the flicker. In my main project I do not need to force_remove to see the flicker. So I assume this may not be needed on another machine.\n\nExample video (only visible just at the beginning, look at the outer cubes):\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b51aee1b-4b73-46e8-98f2-b672b9870035\n\nExample project:\n\n```\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_systems(Startup, setup)\n        .add_systems(Update, flicker)\n        .run();\n}\n\n#[derive(Resource)]\nstruct DebugResource {\n    middle_entity: Entity,\n    middle_mesh: Mesh3d,\n    right_mesh: Mesh3d,\n    left_mesh: Mesh3d,\n    middle_mesh_is_currently_cube: bool\n}\n\n/// set up a simple 3D scene\nfn setup(\n    mut commands: Commands,\n    mut meshes: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>,\n    mut materials: ResMut<Assets<StandardMaterial>>,\n) {\n    // circular base\n    commands.spawn((\n        Mesh3d(meshes.add(Circle::new(4.0))),\n        MeshMaterial3d(materials.add(Color::WHITE)),\n        Transform::from_rotation(Quat::from_rotation_x(-std::f32::consts::FRAC_PI_2)),\n    ));\n\n    // middle cube\n    let middle_mesh = Mesh3d(meshes.add(Cuboid::new(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)));\n    let middle_entity = commands.spawn((\n        middle_mesh.clone(),\n        MeshMaterial3d(materials.add(Color::srgb_u8(124, 144, 255))),\n        Transform::from_xyz(0.0, 0.5, 0.0),\n    )).id();\n\n    // right cube\n    let right_mesh = Mesh3d(meshes.add(Cuboid::new(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)));\n    commands.spawn((\n        right_mesh.clone(),\n        MeshMaterial3d(materials.add(Color::srgb_u8(87, 175, 64))),\n        Transform::from_xyz(1.5, 0.5, 0.0),\n    ));\n\n    // left cube\n    let left_mesh = Mesh3d(meshes.add(Cuboid::new(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)));\n    commands.spawn((\n        left_mesh.clone(),\n        MeshMaterial3d(materials.add(Color::srgb_u8(87, 175, 64))),\n        Transform::from_xyz(-1.5, 0.5, 0.0),\n    ));\n\n    // light\n    commands.spawn((\n        PointLight {\n            shadows_enabled: true,\n            ..default()\n        },\n        Transform::from_xyz(4.0, 8.0, 4.0),\n    ));\n\n    // camera\n    commands.spawn((\n        Camera3d::default(),\n        Transform::from_xyz(-2.5, 4.5, 9.0).looking_at(Vec3::ZERO, Vec3::Y),\n    ));\n\n    let debug_resource = DebugResource {\n        middle_entity,\n        middle_mesh,\n        right_mesh,\n        left_mesh,\n        middle_mesh_is_currently_cube: true        \n    };\n\n    commands.insert_resource(debug_resource);\n}\n\nfn flicker(\n    time: Res<Time>,\n    mut debug_resource: ResMut<DebugResource>,\n    mut meshes: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>,\n    mut commands: Commands\n)\n{\n    if time.elapsed_secs() % 1.0 < 0.1 {\n        // get mutable reference to the mesh we want to flicker (read it to force the compiler to not optimize it away)\n        if let Some(right_mesh) = meshes.get_mut(debug_resource.right_mesh.id()) {\n            println!(\"got mutable reference to right_mesh mesh: {}\", right_mesh.get_vertex_size());\n        }\n\n        // get mutable reference to another mesh we want to flicker (to increase the chance of it happening, read it to force the compiler to not optimize it away)\n        if let Some(left_mesh) = meshes.get_mut(debug_resource.left_mesh.id()) {\n            println!(\"got mutable reference to left_mesh mesh: {}\", left_mesh.get_vertex_size());\n        }\n\n        // update middle mesh\n        let new_mesh = if debug_resource.middle_mesh_is_currently_cube {\n            debug_resource.middle_mesh_is_currently_cube = false;\n            Capsule3d::new(1.0, 2.0).mesh().build()\n        }\n        else {\n            debug_resource.middle_mesh_is_currently_cube = true;\n            Cuboid::new(1.0, 1.0, 1.0).mesh().build()\n        };\n        \n        let mut middle_entity = commands.entity(debug_resource.middle_entity);\n        let new_mesh3d = Mesh3d(meshes.add(new_mesh));        \n        meshes.remove(debug_resource.middle_mesh.id()); // This is needed here to reproduce the flicker on my machine in this example.
