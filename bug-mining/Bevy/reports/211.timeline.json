Objective\r\n\r\n- Refactor the changes merged in #11654 to compute flat normals for indexed meshes instead of smooth normals.\r\n- Fixes #12716 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Partially revert the changes in #11654 to compute flat normals for both indexed and unindexed meshes in `compute_flat_normals`\r\n- Create a new method, `compute_smooth_normals`, that computes smooth normals for indexed meshes\r\n- Create a new method, `compute_normals`, that computes smooth normals for indexed meshes and flat normals for unindexed meshes by default. Use this new method instead of `compute_flat_normals`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Run the example with and without the changes to ensure that the results are identical.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13333/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13333/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12835653186,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86Dhd3ozwAAAAL9EIZC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12835653186","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"65e62ba5eb5b08bbd1cb94b4b48a5d55c152c59b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/65e62ba5eb5b08bbd1cb94b4b48a5d55c152c59b","created_at":"2024-05-16T15:10:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12835653316,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86Dhd3ozwAAAAL9EIbE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12835653316","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-16T15:10:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
