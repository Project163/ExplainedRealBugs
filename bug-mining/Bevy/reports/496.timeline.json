have a fix for this, but it's blocked on #15812.\n\nFor the context: In #15586, we added feature gates for all the image formats. We also moved all the supported extension stuff to `bevy_image`. This included making a constant array of all the supported formats. Sadly, this list of supported formats is on the `ImageFormat` type, not the `ImageLoader` type. This makes it awkward since we can't remove exr and hdr formats from this list (because then the array doesn't have all the formats like it suggests). We also can't move this list of supported formats to `bevy_render`, since it doesn't have all the image format feature flags. So #15812 moves the `ImageLoader` to `bevy_image`, and my next PR moves the supported format stuff to `ImageLoader` and removes exr and hdr from that list.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2408856769/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andriyDev","id":22285953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22285953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev","html_url":"https://github.com/andriyDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14649822806,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86ZU9o8zwAAAANpMo5W","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14649822806","actor":{"login":"andriyDev","id":22285953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22285953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev","html_url":"https://github.com/andriyDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"08ce3de0a9890db73eeb4d1717b2c38ab9b0e40e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/andriyDev/bevy/commits/08ce3de0a9890db73eeb4d1717b2c38ab9b0e40e","created_at":"2024-10-15T03:09:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"andriyDev","id":22285953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22285953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev","html_url":"https://github.com/andriyDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-15T03:17:00Z","updated_at":"2024-10-15T03:17:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15917","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15917/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15917/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15917/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15917","id":2587513587,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U85-nVLW","number":15917,"title":"Move

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #15730.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAs part of #15586, we made a constant to store all the supported image formats. However since the `ImageFormat` does actually include Hdr and OpenExr, it also included the `\"hdr\"` and `\"exr\"` file extensions. These are supported by separate loaders though: `HdrTextureLoader` and `ExrTextureLoader`. This led to a warning about duplicate asset loaders.\r\n\r\nTherefore, instead of having the constant for `ImageFormat`, I made the constant just for `ImageLoader`. This lets us correctly remove `\"hdr\"` and `\"exr\"` from the image formats supported by `ImageLoader`, returning us to having a single asset loader for every image format.\r\n\r\nNote: we could have just removed `hdr` and `exr` from `ImageFormat::SUPPORTED_FILE_EXTENSIONS`, but this would be very confusing. Then the list of `ImageFormat`s would not match the list of supported formats!\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- I ran the `sprite` example and got no warning! I also replaced the sprite in that example with an HDR file and everything worked as expected.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15917/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14650961384,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86ZU9o8zwAAAANpQ-3o","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14650961384","actor":{"login":"andriyDev","id":22285953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22285953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev","html_url":"https://github.com/andriyDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3575333cb6aaf2c939088574e3d29651ab14df54","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/andriyDev/bevy/commits/3575333cb6aaf2c939088574e3d29651ab14df54","created_at":"2024-10-15T05:10:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14662348292,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86ZU9o8zwAAAANp8a4E","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14662348292","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"15440c189b6998238a910c873dee5920e342ef96","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/15440c189b6998238a910c873dee5920e342ef96","created_at":"2024-10-15T18:25:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14662348444,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86ZU9o8zwAAAANp8a6c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14662348444","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-15T18:25:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
