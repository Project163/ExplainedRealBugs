Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #21167 \r\n  (happens with `trace_tracy` feature too, as it adds the plugin automatically)\r\n- There are some uses of `time_span` inside passes, which go around [the check](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/10325593d5bae88e1089bdf1fa1395f232d5248b/crates/bevy_render/src/diagnostic/internal.rs#L289) for [TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_PASSES](https://docs.rs/wgpu-types/latest/wgpu_types/struct.FeaturesWGPU.html#associatedconstant.TIMESTAMP_QUERY_INSIDE_PASSES) feature (unsupported on Apple GPU).\r\nintroduced in  #19191\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- They look like just typos (all in `let pass_span = time_span` form), so replaced with `pass_span`.\r\n\r\nThere's an occurence of this pattern in `meshlet/visibility_buffer_raster_node.rs`, but it's the variable name that seems  incorrect in this case. I renamed it instead.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Running `log_diagnostics` example no longer crashes on
