I would expect a 1 pixel border to be exactly 1 pixel on the screen(see the 0.13.2 screenshot below).\r\n\r\n[This gist](https://gist.github.com/ImDanTheDev/117be26a909bcc16a49b6247836eb4ed) reproduces the issue on commit 0ec6347.\r\n[And this gist](https://gist.github.com/ImDanTheDev/887e0cc67a66f869e05534f1a7baf1e8) does not show the issue on 0.13.2.\r\n\r\n### Possible Fix\r\nI'm not at all fluent with shader code, but while poking around in [ui.wgsl](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/0ec634763ec378193eeea0cc38909e7d7251b272/crates/bevy_ui/src/render/ui.wgsl#L161), I found that on line 161, changing `external_distance < internal_distance` to `external_distance > internal_distance` fixes the issue. After doing that, the border appears exactly the same as the 0.13.2 screenshot below. I have no idea what the implications are for making that change, so it may very well break other things.\r\n\r\nTrue scale:\r\n![true_scale](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/2303421/144ba4bc-2757-4888-aced-bcfe50757817)\r\n\r\nScaled up to highlight issue:\r\n![scaled_up](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/2303421/bf31ba1b-1d38-4c23-b537-92760df3bfe5)\r\n\r\nExpected(using bevy 0.13.2):\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/2303421/c61d9bef-5e25-46a1-90f7-c21a37c4530d)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13503/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
