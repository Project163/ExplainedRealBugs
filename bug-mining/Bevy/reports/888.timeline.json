see two other possible approaches here that might be worth considering: \n\n1. Embrace `Result`!  If `PipeSystem` returned a `Result`, then it could validate the second system just-in-time and return a `SystemParamValidationError` that indicates it was skipped.  The executors could inspect the error and not report it if it was caused by skipping.  (I'm glossing over a lot of tricky details here, but I think the general idea is at least possible.)\n2. Just avoid the bad cases.  We could have `resource_equals` use `Option<Res<T>>` and treat a missing resource as never equal, and then nobody would have to write `resource_exists::<R>.and(resource_equals(R(0))`.

Objective\r\n\r\nAllow combinator and pipe systems to delay validation of the second system, while still allowing the second system to be skipped.  \r\n\r\nFixes #18796\r\n\r\nAllow fallible systems to be used as one-shot systems, reporting errors to the error handler when used through commands.  \r\n\r\nFixes #19722\r\n\r\nAllow fallible systems to be used as run conditions, including when used with combinators.  Alternative to #19580.\r\n\r\nAlways validate parameters when calling the safe `run_without_applying_deferred`, `run`, and `run_readonly` methods on a `System`.  \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nHave `System::run_unsafe` return a `Result`.  \r\n\r\nWe want pipe systems to run the first system before validating the second, since the first system may affect whether the second system has valid parameters.  But if the second system skips then we have no output value to return!  So, pipe systems must return a `Result` that indicates whether the second system ran.  \r\n\r\nBut if we just make pipe systems have `Out = Result<B::Out>`, then chaining `a.pipe(b).pipe(c)` becomes difficult.  `c` would need to accept the `Result` from `a.pipe(b)`, which means it would likely need to return `Result` itself, giving `Result<Result<Out>>`!  \r\n\r\nInstead, we make *all* systems return a `Result`!  We move the handling of fallible systems from `IntoScheduleConfigs` and `IntoObserverSystem` to `SystemParamFunction` and `ExclusiveSystemParamFunction`, so that an infallible system can be wrapped before being passed to a combinator.  \r\n\r\nAs a side effect, this enables fallible systems to be used as run conditions and one-shot systems.  \r\n\r\nNow that the safe `run_without_applying_deferred`, `run`, and `run_readonly` methods return a `Result`, we can have them perform parameter validation themselves instead of requiring each caller to remember to call them.  `run_unsafe` will continue to not validate parameters, since it is used in the multi-threaded executor when we want to validate and run in separate tasks.\r\n\r\nNote that this makes type inference a little more brittle.  A function that returns `Result<T>` can be considered either a fallible system returning `T` or an infallible system returning `Result<T>` (and this is important to continue supporting `pipe`-based error handling)!  So there are some cases where the output type of a system can no longer be inferred.  It will work fine when directly adding to a schedule, since then the output type is fixed to `()` (or `bool` for run conditions).  And it will work fine when `pipe`ing to a system with a typed input parameter.\r\n\r\nI used a dedicated `RunSystemError` for the error type instead of plain `BevyError` so that skipping a system does not box an error or capture a backtrace.
