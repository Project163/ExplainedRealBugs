The result is non-deterministic due to system ordering.\r\n\r\nWhen `GFBD::get_index_and_compare_data()` returns `None` it should skip batching for that item in it's entirety as it may already be being batched by some other pipeline. The `batch_range` of those items should not be modified.\r\n\r\nI was able to mitigate the issue in the repro I have by adding this at line 426:\r\n```rust\r\nif current_batch_input_index.is_none() {\r\n    continue;\r\n}\r\n````\r\nThere may be a more appropriate way to handle this in the context of mesh batching at large but the current behavior is definitely incorrect.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nOriginal bug: https://github.com/james-j-obrien/bevy_vector_shapes/issues/42","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
