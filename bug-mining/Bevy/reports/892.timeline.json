UVec4\r\n\r\nReplace the `u32` field in `MyExtension` by a `UVec4` and only use the `x` coordinate.\r\n\r\n(This was the original approach, but for consistency with the rest of the codebase, separate padding fields seem to be preferred)\r\n\r\n### 2- Don't fix it, unlist it\r\n\r\nWhile the fix is quite simple, it does muddy the waters a tiny bit due to `quantize_steps` now being a UVec4 instead of a simple u32. We could simply remove this example from the examples that support WebGL2.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Ran the example locally on WebGL2 (and native Vulkan)
