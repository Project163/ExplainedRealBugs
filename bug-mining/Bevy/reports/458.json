Bevy version 8316d8969973259d342a930eed7d805ec6dcc780\r\n\r\nThe deferred rendering example is broken on Windows 10 / Vulkan.\r\n\r\nThe issue was introduced at https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/2ae5a21009db00a48193a79962074c583dcb3821 with https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/13497\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by:\r\n  In Device::create_render_pipeline, label = 'deferred_lighting_pipeline'\r\n    Error matching ShaderStages(FRAGMENT) shader requirements against the pipeline\r\n      Shader global ResourceBinding { group: 0, binding: 22 } is not available in the pipeline layout\r\n        View dimension D3 (is array: false) doesn't match the binding Sampler(Filtering)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it issues the following warning:\r\n```\r\nToo many textures in mesh pipeline view layout, this might cause us to hit `wgpu::Limits::max_sampled_textures_per_shader_stage` in some environments.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means it will also be broken on WebGL2, WebGPU, and some native platforms. I haven't investigated yet if solving the `create_render_pipeline` issue will also reduce the number of samples textures (allowing it to run on wasm, etc...)","closed_by":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15525/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15525/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
