Bevy version\n\n0.15\n\n## What went wrong\n\nIn bevy 0.14, the text sections correctly reflect the `JustifyText::Center` parameter, texts are center-aligned:\n\n```rust\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn(Camera2dBundle::default());\n\n    commands.spawn(Text2dBundle {\n        text: Text::from_sections([\n                        TextSection {\n                value: \"Text Justification\\n\".into(),\n                style: TextStyle {\n                    color: WHITE.into(),\n                    ..default()\n                },\n                ..default()\n            },\n            TextSection {\n                value: \"Center\\n\".into(),\n                style: TextStyle {\n                    color: YELLOW.into(),\n                    ..default()\n                },\n                ..default()\n            },\n            TextSection {\n                value: \"xxxxxxxxxxCenterxxxxxxxxxx\".into(),\n                style: TextStyle {\n                    color: RED.into(),\n                    ..default()\n                },\n                ..default()\n            },\n        ])\n        .with_justify(JustifyText::Center),\n        transform: Transform::from_translation(Vec3::default()),\n        ..default()\n    });\n}\n\n```\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7e76b8c-64e6-478c-9dc7-efc5ce9bf998)\n\nHowever, after upgrading to bevy 0.15, the `Text2d` and `TextSpan` are always left-aligned even though the `TextLayout::new_with_justify(JustifyText::Center)` is specified:\n\n```rust\n\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn(Camera2d::default());\n\n    commands\n        .spawn((\n            Text2d::new(\"Text Justification\\n\"),\n            TextLayout::new_with_justify(JustifyText::Center),\n            TextColor::from(WHITE),\n            Transform::from_translation(Vec3::default()),\n        ))\n        .with_children(|parent| {\n            parent.spawn((TextSpan::new(\"Center\\n\"), TextColor::from(YELLOW)));\n            parent.spawn((\n                TextSpan::new(\"xxxxxxxxxxCenterxxxxxxxxxx\"),\n                TextColor::from(RED),\n            ));\n        });\n}\n\n```\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de2dae9c-9384-4487-8550-50d39cb8ca93)\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16783/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16783/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
