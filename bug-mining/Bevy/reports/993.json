The deserializer checks for:\n   - `ReflectDeserialize` (requires `#[derive(Deserialize)]` + `#[reflect(Deserialize)]`)\n   - `ReflectDeserializeWithRegistry` (requires manual registration)\n   \n3. **Without these traits**, it falls back to `deserialize_struct()` which creates a `DynamicStruct` - a generic container that *knows* it represents the actual type via `set_represented_type()`\n\n4. This `DynamicStruct` is passed to **`insert_reflected_components`** which calls:\n   ```rust\n   get_reflect_component(type_registry, reflected.reflect_type_path())\n   ```\n\n5. **The bug**: `reflect_type_path()` on `DynamicStruct` returns `\"bevy_reflect::DynamicStruct\"` (from `impl_type_path!` macro) instead of the represented type's path\n\n6. `get_reflect_component` fails because `\"bevy_reflect::DynamicStruct\"` isn't registered as a component\n\n### The Fix\n\nIn `insert_reflected_components`, check for a represented type first:\n\n```rust\nfn insert_reflected_components(\n    type_registry: &TypeRegistry,\n    mut entity_world_mut: EntityWorldMut,\n    reflect_components: Vec<Box<dyn PartialReflect>>,\n) -> AnyhowResult<()> {\n    for reflected in reflect_components {\n        let type_path = if let Some(represented_type_info) = reflected.get_represented_type_info() {\n            represented_type_info.type_path()  // Use the actual component type\n        } else {\n            reflected.reflect_type_path()      // Fallback for non-dynamic types\n        };\n        \n        let reflect_component = get_reflect_component(type_registry, type_path)?;\n        reflect_component.insert(&mut entity_world_mut, &*reflected, type_registry);\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nI've tested this fix on Bevy 0.16.1 and confirmed it works - components with only `Reflect` can now be successfully spawned and inserted via BRP.\n\n### Help requested\nI'm not a bevy contributor and i don't know the rules - mostly i'm concerned while that this is just a few lines of code to fix in an existing function i want to make sure that it's the right few lines of code. Not being a bevy_remote or bevy_reflect developer I would love it if someone who was could look at this issue and fix it correctly.\n\nIt's a big issue for me and I would love it if it this could make it into 17 as a bug fix.
