#20251\n\n## Context\n\n#15537 introduced the `SubCameraView` API, by copying the equivalent API from three.js. This resulted in a subpar implementation, however, with confusing documentation and undocumented panic conditions, amongst other things.\n\nThe only public API for this feature is the `sub_camera_view` field on `Camera`, which is an `Option<SubCameraView>`. The `SubCameraView` type is defined as:\n```rust\npub struct SubCameraView {\n    pub full_size: UVec2,\n    pub offset: Vec2,\n    pub size: UVec2,\n}\n```\nIf set, this is used to calculate a new, smaller frustum for the camera, which is used for rendering instead of the camera's full frustum.\n\n## The Problems\n\n- ~~This smaller frustum must be entirely contained within the base, unmodified frustum. If it isn't, the current impl throws a WGPU validation error, which in turn throws a panic. As the API is just a few `pub` fields, with no helper methods, there are no safeguards to prevent this from happening.~~ This is caused by the camera's viewport going outside of the window, not directly related to `SubCameraView`.\n- The size of the new frustum is defined as a fraction of the size of the base frustum. Instead of specifying this fraction directly, it is defined implicitly by the component-wise ratio of the values of the `size` and `full_size` fields. This is unnecessarily overcomplicated and confusing.\n- The documentation is lackluster and fails both to explain how to use this feature, and to justify when to use it. The above panic conditions are also not mentioned anywhere.\n- There is an example that showcases `SubCameraView`, but it is unhelpful and hard to understand.\n\n## The Refactor\n\n- The `size` and `full_size` fields should be folded into a single field that directly describes the scaling factor.\n- They should be `Vec2` instead of `UVec2`, because they are already converted directly to `f32` everywhere they are used.\n- ~~Alternatively, instead of scaling being done component-wise with a single `Vec2`, have two `f32` fields, one for each axis.~~ Actually, there should only be a single `f32` scaling value. Using a different scaling factor for each axis can change the aspect ratio of the subview to be different than that of the full frustum/viewport (which have their aspect ratios automatically kept in sync), which just causes the image to become distorted. I don't see a reason to want to do this intentionally.\n- ~~None of the fields should be `pub`, instead there should be methods that enforce the invariants needed to not panic.~~ `SubCameraView` doesn't actually cause panics, although helper methods may still be useful.\n- The documentation should explain how it actually works, including the units used, and examples of motivating use cases.\n- The example should be simplified and reworked to clearly demonstrate the effects that different `SubCameraView` values have, compared to a camera that doesn't use the feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20399/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
