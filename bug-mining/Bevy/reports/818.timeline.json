Bevy version Main https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/dcb8a13b223fbc9425f7af01b3941dd80a229384, 0.13\r\nThis isn't a new issue. Not sure how far it goes back, or if there's exists a previous version without it.\r\n\r\nSpecular reflections from spot/point area lights are disproportionately bright relative to the diffuse response. This often results in extremely bright specular reflections given sufficiently large area lights.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/33357138/80e82c9b-ecc8-4e77-bd2e-4fa434144126)\r\n*This image also displays other specular-related issues in bevy that are not relevant to this issue, let's keep this issue focused, please refer to the blender comparison images below.*\r\n\r\nTest setup: I disabled Tonemapping in both blender and bevy. I visually matched the light brightness using just diffuse. The diffuse falloff in bevy doesn't exactly match blender, but it's close. In blender I'm rendering using Cycles with direct light only (no GI).\r\n\r\nI apologize in advance for the amount of comparison images needed. Note that bevy 0 radius is very similar to blender 0 radius across the board, and bevy 1 radius diffuse is similar to blender 1 radius diffuse (though blender wraps around a bit more here). But bevy 1 radius specular is dramatically brighter than blender 1 radius specular.\r\n\r\nBevy 0 radius, diffuse
