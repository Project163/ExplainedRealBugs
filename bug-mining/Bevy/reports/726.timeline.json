Objective\r\n\r\n- In `Camera::viewport_to_world_2d`, `Camera::viewport_to_world`, `Camera::world_to_viewport` and `Camera::world_to_viewport_with_depth`, the results were incorrect when the `Camera::viewport` field was configured with a viewport position that was non-zero. This PR attempts to correct that.\r\n- Fixes #16200 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- This PR now takes the viewport position into account in the functions mentioned above.\r\n- Extended `2d_viewport_to_world` example to test the functions with a dynamic viewport position and size, camera positions and zoom levels. It is probably worth discussing whether to change the example, add a new one or just completely skip touching the examples.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUsed the modified example to test the functions with dynamic camera transform as well as dynamic viewport size and position.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16661977632,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86cr0k3zwAAAAPhIZog","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16661977632","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"683b08fec93a869b6ab89cbb5d10a5619afc38d2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/683b08fec93a869b6ab89cbb5d10a5619afc38d2","created_at":"2025-03-10T21:36:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16661977793,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86cr0k3zwAAAAPhIZrB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16661977793","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-10T21:36:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
