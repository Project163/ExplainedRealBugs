Objective\r\n- Fixes #16078\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Rename things to clarify that we _want_ unclipped depth for directional light shadow views, and need some way of disabling the GPU's builtin depth clipping\r\n- Use DEPTH_CLIP_CONTROL instead of the fragment shader emulation on supported platforms\r\n  - Pass only the clip position depth instead of the whole clip position between vertex->fragment shader (no idea if this helps performance or not, compiler might optimize it anyways)\r\n- Meshlets\r\n  - HW raster always uses DEPTH_CLIP_CONTROL since it targets a more limited set of platforms\r\n  - SW raster was not handling DEPTH_CLAMP_ORTHO correctly, it ended up pretty much doing nothing.\r\n  - This PR made me realize that SW raster technically should have depth clipping for all views that are not directional light shadows, but I decided not to bother writing it. I'm not sure that it ever matters in practice. If proven otherwise, I can add it.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Did you test these changes? If so, how?\r\n  - Lighting example. Both opaque (no fragment shader) and alpha masked geometry (fragment shader emulation) are working with depth_clip_control, and both work when it's turned off. Also tested meshlet example.\r\n- Are there any parts that need more testing?\r\n  - Performance. I can't figure out a good test scene.\r\n- How can other people (reviewers) test your changes? Is there anything specific they need to know?\r\n  - Toggle depth_clip_control_supported in prepass/mod.rs line 323 to turn this PR on or off.\r\n- If relevant, what platforms did you test these changes on, and are there any important ones you can't test?\r\n  - Native\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n- `MeshPipelineKey::DEPTH_CLAMP_ORTHO` is now `MeshPipelineKey::UNCLIPPED_DEPTH_ORTHO`\r\n- The `DEPTH_CLAMP_ORTHO` shaderdef has been renamed to `UNCLIPPED_DEPTH_ORTHO_EMULATION`\r\n- `clip_position_unclamped: vec4<f32>` is now `unclipped_depth: f32`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16095/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14969997351,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86bnCfPzwAAAAN8SAgn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14969997351","actor":{"login":"BenjaminBrienen","id":42162869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTYyODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42162869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminBrienen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-28T21:47:19Z","label":{"name":"S-Ready-For-Implementation","color":"D876E3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14969997360,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86bnCfPzwAAAAN8SAgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14969997360","actor":{"login":"BenjaminBrienen","id":42162869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTYyODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42162869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminBrienen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-28T21:47:19Z","label":{"name":"D-Straightforward","color":"008672"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14969997371,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86bnCfPzwAAAAN8SAg7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14969997371","actor":{"login":"BenjaminBrienen","id":42162869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTYyODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42162869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminBrienen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-28T21:47:19Z","label":{"name":"D-Shaders","color":"008672"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14988306388,"node_id":"ATPVTE_lADODf6-U86bnCfPzwAAAAN9X2fU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14988306388","actor":{"login":"JMS55","id":47158642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTU4NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47158642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55","html_url":"https://github.com/JMS55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://
