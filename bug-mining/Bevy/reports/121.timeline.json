Objective\r\n\r\nCurrently in order to retrieve the inner values from direction types is that you need to use the `Deref` trait or `From`/`Into`. `Deref` that is currently implemented is an anti-pattern that I believe should be less relied upon.\r\nThis pull-request add getters for retrieving the inner values for direction types.\r\n\nAdvantages of getters:\n- Let rust-analyzer to list out available methods for users to understand better to on how to get the inner value. (This happens to me. I really don't know how to get the value until I look through the source code.)\n- They are simple.\n- Generally won't be ambiguous in most context. Traits such as `From`/`Into` will require fully qualified syntax from time to time.\n- Unsurprising result.\n\nDisadvantages of getters:\n- More verbose\n\nAdvantages of deref polymorphism:\n- You reduce boilerplate for getting the value and call inner methods by:\n  ```rust\n  let dir = Dir3::new(Vec3::UP).unwrap();\n  // getting value\n  let value = *dir;\n  // instead of using getters\n  let value = dir.vec3();\n\n  // calling methods for the inner vector\n  dir.xy();\n  // instead of using getters\n  dir.vec3().xy();\n  ```\n\nDisadvantages of deref polymorphism:\n- When under more level of indirection, it will requires more dereferencing which will get ugly in some part:\n  ```rust\n  // getting value\n  let value = **dir;\n  // instead of using getters\n  let value = dir.vec3();\n\n  // calling methods for the inner vector\n  dir.xy();\n  // instead of using getters\n  dir.vec3().xy();\n  ```\n\n[More detail here](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/anti_patterns/deref.html).\n\n\nEdit: Update information for From/Into trait.\nEdit: Advantages and disadvantages.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdd `vec2` method for Dir2.\r\nAdd `vec3` method for Dir3.\r\nAdd `vec3a` method for Dir3A.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12143213853,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86CkNuYzwAAAALTyr0d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12143213853","actor":{"login":"SolarLiner","id":4302963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDI5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner","html_url":"https://github.com/SolarLiner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-17T15:22:27Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Triage","color":"D876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12143213856,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86CkNuYzwAAAALTyr0g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12143213856","actor":{"login":"SolarLiner","id":4302963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDI5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner","html_url":"https://github.com/SolarLiner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-17T15:22:27Z","label":{"name":"A-Math","color":"c6a751"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12143215669,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86CkNuYzwAAAALTysQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12143215669","actor":{"login":"SolarLiner","id":4302963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDI5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner","html_url":"https://github.com/SolarLiner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-17T15:23:23Z","label":{"name":"S-Ready-For-Implementation","color":"D876E3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12143414831,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86CkNuYzwAAAALTzc4v","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12143414831","actor":{"login":"SolarLiner","id":4302963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDI5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4302963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner","html_url":"https://github.com/SolarLiner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SolarLiner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.g
