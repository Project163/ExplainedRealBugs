Ignoring synthetic events should fix #12273 as well (EDIT: only if #12878 doesn't get merged) (see also #12372).\r\n\r\nThere are multiple related issues around how keys behave when focus is lost/gained – behavior differs between platforms (and keys). Documenting that would be great, but doesn't need to happen in this PR.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2148593886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SpecificProtagonist","id":30270112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjcwMTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30270112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist","html_url":"https://github.com/SpecificProtagonist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2148726543","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13299#issuecomment-2148726543","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13299","id":2148726543,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86AEvcP","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-05T02:08:25Z","updated_at":"2024-06-05T02:08:25Z","body":"Seconding

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #13299\r\n\r\nOn Linux/X11, changing focus into a winit window will produce winit KeyboardInput events with a \"is_synthetic=true\" flag that are not intended to be used. Bevy erroneously passes them on to the user, resulting in phantom key presses.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis patch properly filters out winit KeyboardInput events with \"is_synthetic=true\".\r\n\r\nFor example, pressing Alt+Tab to focus a bevy winit window results in a permanently stuck Tab key until the user presses Tab once again to produce a winit KeyboardInput release event. The Tab key press event that causes this problem is \"synthetic\", should not be used according to the winit devs, and simply ignoring it fixes this problem.\r\n\r\nSynthetic key **releases** are still evaluated though, as they are essential for correct release key handling. For example, if the user binds the key combination Alt+1 to the action \"move the window to workspace 1\", places the bevy game in workspace 2, focuses the game and presses Alt+1, then the key release event for the \"1\" key will be synthetic. If we would filter out all synthetic keys, the bevy game would think that the 1 key remains pressed forever, until the user manually presses+releases the key again inside bevy.\r\n\r\nReference: https://docs.rs/winit/0.30.0/winit/event/enum.WindowEvent.html#variant.KeyboardInput.field.is_synthetic\r\nRelevant discussion: https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/3543\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTested with the \"keyboard_input_events\" example. Entering/exiting the window with various keys, as well as changing its workspace, produces the correct press/release
