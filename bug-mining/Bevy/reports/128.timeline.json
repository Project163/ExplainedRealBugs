             Nit for future PR: We should add hue rotation traits to make this cleaner.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @bushrat011899 in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12163#discussion_r1506997793_\r\n            \r\n            \r\nMuch like the `Alpha` trait, we should provide easy ways to \"rotate\" the hue of colors: shifting them by a provided number of degrees to rotate the metaphorical color wheel.\r\n\r\nThis trait should only be implemented for the color models (types) with an explicit hue element: other color types should be converted to one of those spaces first.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce basic hue rotation is added, we can add nice color theory options: things like \"complementary colors\" (rotate by 180 degrees), \"triadic colors\" (rotate by 120 degrees), analogous colors and so on.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12200/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12200/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12210211487,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86DMB73zwAAAALXyQqf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12210211487","actor":{"login":"viridia","id":1166135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia","html_url":"https://github.com/viridia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f3efd01bcef8aeff46466293a7a6b375fdffeb7e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/viridia/bevy/commits/f3efd01bcef8aeff46466293a7a6b375fdffeb7e","created_at":"2024-03-22T03:01:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"viridia","id":1166135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia","html_url":"https://github.com/viridia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-22T03:01:53Z","updated_at":"2024-03-22T03:01:53Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12641","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12641/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12641/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12641/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12641","id":2201599773,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U85qcM0d","number":12641,"title":"Interpolating
