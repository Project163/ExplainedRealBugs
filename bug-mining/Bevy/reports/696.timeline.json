Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #17960\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Followed the [edition upgrade guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/editions/transitioning-an-existing-project-to-a-new-edition.html)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- CI\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Summary of Changes\r\n\r\n### Documentation Indentation\r\n\r\nWhen using lists in documentation, proper indentation is now linted for. This means subsequent lines within the same list item must start at the same indentation level as the item.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n/* Valid */\r\n/// - Item 1\r\n///   Run-on sentence.\r\n/// - Item 2\r\nstruct Foo;\r\n\r\n/* Invalid */\r\n/// - Item 1\r\n///     Run-on sentence.\r\n/// - Item 2\r\nstruct Foo;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Implicit `!` to `()` Conversion\r\n\r\n`!` (the never return type, returned by `panic!`, etc.) no longer implicitly converts to `()`. This is particularly painful for systems with `todo!` or `panic!` statements, as they will no longer be functions returning `()` (or `Result<()>`), making them invalid systems for functions like `add_systems`. The ideal fix would be to accept functions returning `!` (or rather, _not_ returning), but this is blocked on the [stabilisation of the `!` type itself](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.never.html), which is not done.\r\n\r\nThe \"simple\" fix would be to add an explicit `-> ()` to system signatures (e.g., `|| { todo!() }` becomes `|| -> () { todo!() }`). However, this is _also_ banned, as there is an existing lint which (IMO, incorrectly) marks this as an unnecessary annotation.\r\n\r\nSo, the \"fix\" (read: workaround) is to put these kinds of `|| -> ! { ... }` closuers into variables and give the variable an explicit type (e.g., `fn()`).\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Valid\r\nlet system: fn() = || todo!(\"Not implemented yet!\");\r\napp.add_systems(..., system);\r\n\r\n// Invalid\r\napp.add_systems(..., || todo!(\"Not implemented yet!\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Temporary Variable Lifetimes\r\n\r\nThe order in which temporary variables are dropped has changed. The simple fix here is _usually_ to just assign temporaries to a named variable before use.\r\n\r\n### `gen` is a keyword\r\n\r\nWe can no longer use the name `gen` as it is reserved for a future generator syntax. This involved replacing uses of the name `gen` with `r#gen` (the raw-identifier syntax).\r\n\r\n### Formatting has changed\r\n\r\nUse statements have had the order of imports changed, causing a substantial +/-3,000 diff when applied. For now, I have opted-out of this change by amending `rustfmt.toml`\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nstyle_edition = \"2021\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis preserves the original formatting for now, reducing the size of this PR. It would be a simple followup to update this to 2024 and run `cargo fmt`.\r\n\r\n### New `use<>` Opt-Out Syntax\r\n\r\nLifetimes are now implicitly included in RPIT types. There was a handful of instances where it needed to be added to satisfy the borrow checker, but there may be more cases where it _should_ be added to avoid breakages in user code.\r\n\r\n### `MyUnitStruct { .. }` is an invalid pattern\r\n\r\nPreviously, you could match against unit structs (and unit enum variants) with a `{ .. }` destructuring. This is no longer valid.\r\n\r\n### Pretty much every use of `ref` and `mut` are gone\r\n\r\nPattern binding has changed to the point where these terms are largely unused now. They still serve a purpose, but it is far more niche now.\r\n\r\n### `iter::repeat(...).take(...)` is bad\r\n\r\nNew lint recommends using the more explicit `iter::repeat_n(..., ...)` instead.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThe lifetimes of functions using return-position impl-trait (RPIT) are likely _more_ conservative than they had been previously. If you encounter lifetime issues with such a function, please create an issue to investigate the addition of `+ use<...>`.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- Check the individual commits for a clearer breakdown for what _actually_ changed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17967/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17967/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2674485045","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17960#issuecomment-2674485045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17960","id":2674485045,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86faWc1","user":{"login":"BD103","id":59022059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDIyMDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59022059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103","html_url":"https://github.com/BD103","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-21T12:55:48Z","updated_at":"2025-02-21T12:56:36Z","body":"I personally think this should be split into multiple PRs to ease the transition.
