What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nIn the event that a `Mut<T>` needs to be optionally converted into a `Mut<U>` where a `T` may or may not contain a `U`.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\n`Mut<T>` could have a method added, `filter_map_unchanged()` with the signature `fn(self, impl FnOnce(&mut T) -> Option<&mut U>) -> Option<Mut<U>>`\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\n```rs\r\n    .filter_map(|x| {\r\n        if let SomeEnum::SomeVariant(_) = x.kind {\r\n            Some(x.reborrow().map_unchanged(|y| {\r\n                if let SomeEnum::SomeVariant(data) = &mut y.kind {\r\n                    data\r\n                } else {\r\n                    unreachable!()\r\n                }\r\n            }))\r\n        } else {\r\n            None\r\n        }\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the proposed added API, that code block could be rewritten as\r\n```rs\r\n.filter_map(|x| x.reborrow().filter_map_unchanged(|y| match &mut y.kind {\r\n    SomeEnum::SomeVariant(data) => Some(data),\r\n    _ => None,\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nDiscussed in the bevy discord\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14836/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14836/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
