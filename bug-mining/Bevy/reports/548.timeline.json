Objective\r\n\r\nRIght now it's not possible to opt out of sprite or ui picking at the feature level without jumping through some hoops.\r\n\r\nIf you add the `bevy_sprite` feature, you get `bevy_sprite_picking_backend`.\r\n\r\nIf you add the `bevy_ui` feature, you get `bevy_ui_picking_backend`\r\n\r\nTo get `bevy_sprite` without picking, I think you would have to do something like this, which seems **very** annoying.\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[dependencies]\r\nbevy = { version = \"0.15\", default-features = false, features = [\r\n    # ... omitted\r\n    # \"bevy_sprite\",\r\n    # \"bevy_ui\", # this also brings in bevy_sprite\r\n    # \"bevy_text\", # this also brings in bevy_sprite\r\n    \"bevy_render\",\r\n    \"bevy_core_pipeline\",\r\n    \"bevy_color\",\r\n] }\r\nbevy_internal = { version = \"0.15\", default-features = false, features = [\r\n    \"bevy_sprite\",\r\n    \"bevy_ui\",\r\n    \"bevy_text\"\r\n] }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Remove `bevy_sprite_picking_backend` from the `bevy_sprite` feature.\r\n- Remove `bevy_ui_picking_backend` from the `bevy_ui` feature.\r\n\r\nThese are still in Bevy's `default-plugins`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI did some basic testing in a minimal project based on the `sprite_picking` example to verify that \"picking stuff\" didn't get included with `bevy_sprite`.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate help testing. I am just unraveling these features and think that this is correct, but I am not 100% sure.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n`bevy_sprite_picking_backend` is no longer included by default when using the `bevy_sprite` feature. If you are using Bevy without default features and relied on sprite picking, add this feature to your `Cargo.toml`.\r\n\r\n`bevy_ui_picking_backend` is no longer included by default when using the `bevy_ui` feature.
