Objective\r\nFixes #12727. All parts that `PersistentGpuBuffer` interact with should be 100% safe both on the CPU and the GPU: `Queue::write_buffer_with` zeroes out the slice being written to and when uploading to the GPU, and all slice writes are bounds checked on the CPU side.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nMake `PersistentGpuBufferable` a safe trait.  Enforce it's correct implementation via assertions. Re-enable `forbid(unsafe_code)` on `bevy_pbr`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12744/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12295051157,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86DkPhJzwAAAALc15eV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12295051157","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e62a01f4035324108cbaf6c9f94923aec25e6579","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/e62a01f4035324108cbaf6c9f94923aec25e6579","created_at":"2024-03-29T13:29:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12295051260,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86DkPhJzwAAAALc15f8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12295051260","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-29T13:29:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
