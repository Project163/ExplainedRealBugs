Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #15142\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n* Moved all the UI border geometry calculations that were scattered through the UI extraction functions into `ui_layout_system`.\r\n* Added a `border: BorderRect` field to `Node` to store the border size computed by `ui_layout_system`.\r\n* Use the border values returned from Taffy rather than calculate them ourselves during extraction.\r\n* Removed the `logical_rect` and `physical_rect` methods from `Node` the descriptions and namings are deceptive, it's better to create the rects manually instead.\r\n* Added a method `outline_radius` to `Node` that calculates the border radius of outlines.\r\n* For border values `ExtractedUiNode` takes `BorderRect` and `ResolvedBorderRadius` now instead of raw `[f32; 4]` values and converts them in `prepare_uinodes`.\r\n* Removed some unnecessary scaling and clamping of border values (#15142).\r\n* Added a `BorderRect::ZERO` constant.\r\n* Added an `outlined_node_size` method to `Node`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAdded some non-uniform borders to the border example. Everything seems to be in order:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"626\" alt=\"nub\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/258ed8b5-1a9e-4ac5-99c2-6bf25c0ef31c\">\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThe `logical_rect` and `physical_rect` methods have been removed from `Node`.
