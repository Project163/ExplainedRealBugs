A prime example is https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/8949. So, I want to force winit to try to lock the cursor again. However, Bevy stops me, as it thinks that the cursor is already locked. Instead, I need to first change the lock mode to a placeholder setting to clear the cache, then use the real setting.\n\nThe solution is to simply remove the caching.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nThe offending lines are around \nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/4da420cc4c0b30e57b7f9bb3b4bc8a95578345b1/crates/bevy_winit/src/system.rs#L410\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19627/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
