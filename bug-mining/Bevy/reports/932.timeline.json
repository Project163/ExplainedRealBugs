this is funny. I think what's happening is we're triggering #12756. So we're actually loading the GLTF ~4 times. Then I guess the setup_scene_once_loaded runs after one of those loads, and before some of the loads? Which causes the scene to reload and lose the state. \n\nAnother thing I noticed might be happening: if we get an AssetEvent::Modified on the same frame as AssetEvent::Added, we'll actually spawn the scene, then despawn and respawn it (to handle the modified asset).

Objective\r\nImprove the performance of Bevy's async task executor and clean up the code surrounding `TaskPool::scope`. Fixes #20421.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n * Inline a copy of `async_executor`'s code\r\n * Move the TLS `LocalExecutor` and `ThreadExecutor` into the core `Executor` implementation, and poll their queues in `Executor::run`.\r\n * Use `!Send` types for local queues (`Mutex` -> `UnsafeCell`, `ConcurrentQueue` -> `VecDeque`).\r\n * Avoid extra `Arc` clones by using `&'static` references to thread-local queues.\r\n * Avoid extra contention on the global injector queue, and minimize extra allocations by opportunistically pushing onto thread-local queues when done on \"executor-owned\" threads.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change.\r\n\r\n * `ThreadExecutor` is now `ThreadSpawner` and forbids ticking and running the executor, only allowing spawning tasks to the target thread.\r\n * `Executor` and `LocalExecutor` wrappers are no longer public.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nI've only tested this against a few examples: 3d_scene and many_foxes. ~~This current implementation does seems to break animation systems.~~ EDIT: That seems to be #20383.\r\n\r\n### Performance Testing\r\nAll of the benchmarks including a multithreaded schedule run are included below. Overall, this seems to be significant win whenever there are a very large number of tasks (i.e. the empty_archetypes/par_for_each` benchmarks), with some being upwards of 2x faster due to lower contention.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```\r\ngroup                                                                                                     bevy_executor                            main\r\n-----                                                                                                     -------------                            ----\r\nadded_archetypes/archetype_count/100                                                                      1.00     36.8±1.13µs        ?

Would likely need a new implementation of #12990~~ Done in #20649.\r\n - [ ] Add support for [`rayon::spawn_broadcast`](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/fn.spawn_broadcast.html) style APIs for more aggressively waking up threads than what the current implementation allows.\r\n - [ ] Replace `ThreadSpawner` with a more integrated `Executor::spawn_to_thread(ThreadId, Fut)` API instead, and use the ThreadIds tracked by `NonSend` resources to schedule those systems.\r\n - [ ] Support non-async Tasks (i.e. `FnOnce`) for lower-overhead execution, would avoid some extra atomics and state management.\r\n - [ ] Create a custom `block_on` implementation that ticks the local and thread-locked queues.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20331/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19029328270,"node_id":"MADE_lADODf6-U87D2m1izwAAAARuPIGO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19029328270","actor":{"login":"andriyDev","id":22285953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22285953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev","html_url":"https://github.com/andriyDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"marked_as_duplicate","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-07T07:47:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"andriyDev","id":22285953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22285953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev","html_url":"https://github.com/andriyDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-07T07:56:51Z","updated_at":"2025-08-07T07:56:51Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20449","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20449/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20449/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20449/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/20449","id":3299439125,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86iiEMy","number":20449,"title":"Add

Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #20383.\r\n- Fixes #12756.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Count the number of loads for a root asset that are currently happening. Note this needs to count assets by path and type ID, since you could be loading an asset path multiple times with different types.\r\n- Don't launch a new load for a root asset if its number of loads is positive.\r\n- Add some special handling for `load_untyped_async` to allow it to load even if the number of loads is already positive (since we need the handle, which means awaiting the async task which needs to perform the actual load).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Added a test to check that we only launch one task.\r\n    - This test is brittle. We don't have any way to count how many tasks are currently running, so the best we can do is just hope the tasks finish quickly and stall until they are done.\r\n- Ran the `many_foxes` example and it now works correctly!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20449/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19074666299,"node_id":"RTE_lADODf6-U87D2m1izwAAAARw8E87","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19074666299","actor":{"login":"greeble-dev","id":166992735,"node_id":"U_kgDOCfQbXw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166992735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/greeble-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-10T07:44:57Z","rename":{"from":"`many_foxes`

Objective\r\n\r\n- examples `many_foxes` and `morph_targets` have stopped working since #18358\r\n- any case that load several parts of a complex asset and a scene, and do setup on asset load will fail\r\n- Fixes #20383\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Debounce scene asset events so that we ignore modified event happening too quickly after each others\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- run examples `many_foxes` or `morph_targets`\r\n\r\n## Alternative\r\n\r\nI *don't* think this is a good long term fix, but this should be fixed in the 0.17 and I think alternatives are worse / too complex.\r\n\r\nAlternatives are:\r\n- Revert #18358. Normal scene loading is more important than hot reloading\r\n- Implement partial asset loading in the asset server and the gltf loader so that when we load `file.gltf#Animation0`, only the animation data is loaded. This would be a very good change, but too big to do for the 0.17\r\n- Have the asset server load parent assets only once, even when loading subassets. This would be a good change and less complex, but I think worse than the previous idea and  kinda not compatible with
