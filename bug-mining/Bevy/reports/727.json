Bevy version\n\n0.15.3\n\n## What you did\n\nI was creating a effect system that run one shot system, and can take effect as parameters to run them from that one shot system (which mean i can call the same one shot system from the same system, but it's not rly recursive)\n\n## What went wrong\nI discovered that you cannot call X one shot system from the same system\n\n## Isolated minimal example\n\n```rust\nuse bevy::{ecs::system::SystemId, prelude::*};\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut app = App::new();\n    let id = app.register_system(one_shot_system);\n\n    app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins);\n    \n    app.insert_resource(TestRes {\n        id: id,\n        counter: 5\n    });\n\n    app.add_systems(Startup, test_startup);\n    app.run();\n}\n\npub fn test_startup(mut commands: Commands, test: Res<TestRes>) {\n    commands.run_system(test.id);\n}\n\n#[derive(Resource)]\npub struct TestRes {\n    id: SystemId,\n    counter: u32\n}\n\npub fn one_shot_system(mut commands: Commands, mut test: ResMut<TestRes>) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", test.counter);\n    test.counter = test.counter-1;\n\n    if test.counter > 0 {\n        commands.run_system(test.id);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis only call one_shot_sytem once and the commands.run_system inside it do nothing.\n\n\n\nOf course this is not rly my use case but it's the same bug in the end.\n\nApparently i can just go with observers since i was told they can recursivly call themself, which i tried to avoid since in my use case it's mean 500 entities, one for each effect), but in the end it's probably nothing and have 0 perf issue.\n\nBut i wanted to know if this was intended or not cause it's documented nowhere (or i'm blind, it's a posibility i just have reading issues).\n\nI think this happens cause the system may be removed from the world while it's executed","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18030/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
