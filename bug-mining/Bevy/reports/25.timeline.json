Objective\r\n\r\n- `bevy_ui` fails to compile without `bevy_text` being enabled.\r\n- Fixes #11363.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Add `#[cfg(feature = \"bevy_text\")]` to all items that require it.\r\n\r\nI think this change is honestly a bit ugly, but I can't see any other way around it. I considered making `bevy_text` required, but we agreed [on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/743663673393938453/1196868117486379148) that there were some use cases for `bevy_ui` without `bevy_text`. If you have any ideas that decreases the amount of `#[cfg(...)]`s and `#[allow(...)]`s, that would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThis was tested by running the following commands:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ cargo clippy -p bevy_ui\r\n$ cargo clippy -p bevy_ui -F bevy_text\r\n$ cargo run -p ci\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Fixed `bevy_ui` not compiling without `bevy_text`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11391/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11620407573,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U858JXJszwAAAAK0oVkV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11620407573","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"069a8776f52c981dc0ed19b17448359f33c150c5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/069a8776f52c981dc0ed19b17448359f33c150c5","created_at":"2024-01-28T16:39:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11620407589,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U858JXJszwAAAAK0oVkl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11620407589","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-28T16:39:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11711619531,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U858JXJszwAAAAK6ESHL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11711619531","actor":{"login":"tjamaan","id":22967219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTY3MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22967219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan","html_url":"https://github.com/tjamaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"28953572b165627a2f98cca97d0ca19651d909ed","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tjamaan/bevy/commits/28953572b165627a2f98cca97d0ca19651d909ed","created_at":"2024-02-06T00:52:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
