Bevy version\n\nBevy `0.16.0-rc.5`\n\n## What you did\n\n- Run the example server:\n```sh\ncargo run --example server --features=\"bevy_remote\"\n```\n- Run the \"Add strict field to BRP bevy/query\" example in the [0.15 to 0.16 migration guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/migration-guides/0-15-to-0-16/#add-strict-field-to-brp-bevy-query):\n```sh\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:15702 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{ \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"bevy/query\", \"id\": 0, \"params\": { \"data\": { \"components\": [ \"foo::bar::MyComponent\" ] } } }'\n```\nFormatted JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"method\": \"bevy/query\",\n  \"id\": 0,\n  \"params\": {\n    \"data\": {\n      \"components\": [\n        \"foo::bar::MyComponent\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI tried with or without `\"strict\": false`, same issue.\n\n## What went wrong\n\nExpected result: return an empty list of entities, since `foo::bar::MyComponent` doesn't exist:\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 0,\n  \"result\": []\n}\n```\n\nActual result: an error.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\n  \"id\": 0,\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": -23402,\n    \"message\": \"Unknown component type: `foo::bar::MyComponent`\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt seems PR <https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/16725> didn't work as expected.\n\n## Additional information\n\nThe migration documentation example query has an issue: it should have `jsonrpc\": \"2.0\"` since this is required, otherwise Bevy replies with an error.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18869/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
