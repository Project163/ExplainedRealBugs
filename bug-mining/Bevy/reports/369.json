There are some places where it makes sense to integrate these that should probably be addressed in some fashion; the purpose of this issue is to track these.\r\n- [x] Conversion methods relating `Transform`/`GlobalTransform` and `Isometry3d`. (#14478)\r\n- [x] `Bounded2d`/`Bounded3d` could use isometry types in addition to raw translations/rotations. (#14485)\r\n- [x] Gizmos could use isometries to position figures in place of raw translation/rotations (requires investigation and some finesse to deal with 2d gizmos as well). (#14676)\r\n\r\nThese are all relatively similar in flavor, so it would be good if they blended harmoniously together (e.g. making it relatively easy to extract an `Isometry3d` from a `Transform` to position a sphere gizmo, for example).
