Objective\r\n\r\n- Closes #15577\r\n\r\nUnlike `get_components`, we're able to add a mutable variant here since checking for aliasing is as simple as ensuring uniqueness in a slice.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdded:\r\n```rust\r\nimpl<'w> EntityRef<'w> {\r\n    pub fn get_components_by_id<const N: usize>(&self, component_ids: [ComponentId; N]) -> Result<[Ptr<'w>; N], EntityComponentError>;\r\n    pub fn get_components_dynamic_by_id(&self, component_ids: &[ComponentId]) -> Result<Vec<Ptr<'w>>, EntityComponentError>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<'w> EntityMut<'w> {\r\n    pub fn get_components_by_id<const N: usize>(&self, component_ids: [ComponentId; N]) -> Result<[Ptr<'_>; N], EntityComponentError>;\r\n    pub fn get_components_dynamic_by_id(&self, component_ids: &[ComponentId]) -> Result<Vec<Ptr<'_>>, EntityComponentError>;\r\n\r\n    pub fn get_components_mut_by_id<const N: usize>(&mut self, component_ids: [ComponentId; N]) -> Result<[MutUntyped<'_>; N], EntityComponentError>;\r\n    pub fn get_components_dynamic_mut_by_id(&mut self, component_ids: &[ComponentId]) -> Result<Vec<MutUntyped<'_>>, EntityComponentError>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<'w> EntityWorldMut<'w> {\r\n    pub fn get_components_by_id<const N: usize>(&self, component_ids: [ComponentId; N]) -> Result<[Ptr<'_>; N], EntityComponentError>;\r\n    pub fn get_components_dynamic_by_id(&self, component_ids: &[ComponentId]) -> Result<Vec<Ptr<'_>>, EntityComponentError>;\r\n\r\n    pub fn get_components_mut_by_id<const N: usize>(&mut self, component_ids: [ComponentId; N]) -> Result<[MutUntyped<'_>; N], EntityComponentError>;\r\n    pub fn get_components_dynamic_mut_by_id(&mut self, component_ids: &[ComponentId]) -> Result<Vec<MutUntyped<'_>>, EntityComponentError>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI originally added a `get_components_from_set_mut_by_id` function that takes a `HashSet` and returns a `Vec`, but ideally that should return a `HashMap` as the order isn't guaranteed with a `Vec`. I'll leave that to a follow up PR (and hopefully one that abstracts over the container).\r\n\r\nI'm open to bikeshedding the names, but I think these draw a nice parallel with `get_components`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAdded 4 new tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15587/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ItsDoot","id":9044780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDQ3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9044780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot","html_url":"https://github.com/ItsDoot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-02T17:58:28Z","updated_at":"2024-10-02T17:58:28Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15593","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15593/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15593/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15593/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15593","id":2560913152,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U859V7xB","number":15593,"title":"Enable `EntityRef::get_by_id` and friends to take multiple ids and get multiple pointers back","user":{"login":"ItsDoot","id":9044780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDQ3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9044780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot","html_url":"https://github.com/ItsDoot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ItsDoot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":2747857990,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODU3OTkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Usability","name":"C-Usability","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A targeted quality-of-life change that makes Bevy easier to use"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.
