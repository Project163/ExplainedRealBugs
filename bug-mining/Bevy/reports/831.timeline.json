Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #18869.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe issue was the `?` after a `Result` raising the error, instead of treating it.\r\nInstead it is handled with `ok`, `and_then`, `map` ...\r\n\r\n_Edit: I added the following logic._\r\nOn `bevy/query` remote requests, when `strict` is false:\r\n- Unregistered components in `option` and `without` are ignored.\r\n- Unregistered components in `has` are considered absent from the entity.\r\n- Unregistered components in `components` and `with` result in an empty response since they specify hard requirements.\r\n\r\nI made the `get_component_ids` function return a `AnyhowResult<(Vec<(TypeId, ComponentId)>, Vec<String>)>` instead of the previous `AnyhowResult<Vec<(TypeId, ComponentId)>>`; that is I added the list of unregistered components.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI tested changes using the same procedure as in the linked issue:\r\n```sh\r\ncargo run --example server --features=\"bevy_remote\"\r\n```\r\nIn another terminal:\r\n```sh\r\n# Not strict:\r\n$ curl -X POST http://localhost:15702 -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{ \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"bevy/query\", \"id\": 0,

BRP Query behavior\n\nI think that before working on any fixes, we should agree on what we want from the API.\n\nI wrote a small synthesis of the behaviors I would personally expect vs. the existing bevy `main` behaviors from a BRP client pov:\n\n- With a `strict` mode set to `false`:\n\t- BrpQuery only on registered components: works as expected\n\t- BrpQuery with at least 1 non-registered component:\n\t\t- in `components` access: retrieve an empty list as a response (bevy `main`: this returns an error)\n\t\t- in `optional` access: no such components values in the response (bevy `main`: this returns an error)\n\t\t- in `has` param: retrieve `false` as a value for the non-registered components (bevy `main`: this returns an error)\n\t\t- in `without` filter: retrieve a response as if these components were not specified in `Without` (bevy `main`: this returns an error)\n\t\t- in `with` filter: retrieve an empty list as a response (bevy `main`: this returns an error)\n\n- With a `strict` mode set to `true`\n\t- BrpQuery only on registered components: works as expected\n\t- BrpQuery with at least 1 non-registered component in any field: get an error response (current bevy `main` behavior)\n\n**Is the above the behavior agreed on by everyone ?**\n\n**Alternative**: BRP server always behave in a `strict:false` mode, `strict` would not exist as a query parameter anymore, and we'd have an additional field in the response indicating non-registered components.\n\n### Release 0.16 todos\n\nConsidering that the `strict` implementation of #16725 as it exists is not working and that the proposed fix in #18871 is not complete either:\n- Should #16725 be reverted before exposing its API (the new `strict` parameter) as public in the 0.16 release ?\n- Or should we leave it there and implement `strict` mode `false` in 0.16.1
