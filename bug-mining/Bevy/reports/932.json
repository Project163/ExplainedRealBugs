I tagged a few functions and got this log:\n\n```\n[crates\\bevy_scene\\src\\scene_spawner.rs:324:9] \"spawn_sync_internal\"\n[crates\\bevy_scene\\src\\scene_spawner.rs:324:9] \"spawn_sync_internal\"\n[crates\\bevy_scene\\src\\scene_spawner.rs:324:9] \"spawn_sync_internal\"\n[examples\\stress_tests\\many_foxes.rs:240:9] \"setup_scene_once_loaded\"\n[crates\\bevy_scene\\src\\scene_spawner.rs:324:9] \"spawn_sync_internal\"\n[crates\\bevy_scene\\src\\scene_spawner.rs:324:9] \"spawn_sync_internal\"\n[crates\\bevy_scene\\src\\scene_spawner.rs:324:9] \"spawn_sync_internal\"\n```\n\nBefore the change, there are no calls to `spawn_sync_internal` after the `setup_scene_one_loaded`.\n\nOther examples that rely on scene spawning observers or `Added<AnimationPlayer>` are not affected. If I hack the broken examples to use `Added<AnimationPlayer>` then they start working.","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20383/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
