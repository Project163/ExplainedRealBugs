WorldCell's support of everything a World can do is incomplete, and represents an alternative, potentially confusing, and less performant way of pulling multiple fetches from a `World`. The typical approach is to use `SystemState` for a runtime cached and safe way, or `UnsafeWorldCell` if the use of `unsafe` is tolerable.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nRemove it!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\nRemoved: `WorldCell`\r\nRemoved: `World::cell`\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n`WorldCell` has been removed. If you were using it to fetch multiple distinct values from a `&mut World`, use `SystemState` by calling `SystemState::get` instead. Alternatively, if `SystemState` cannot be used, `UnsafeWorldCell` can instead be used in unsafe contexts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12551/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12551/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12146653502,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86CmAyszwAAAALT_zk-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12146653502","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6760b6e8a5376583ddc4b6ee0b12fc95250ea5f1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/6760b6e8a5376583ddc4b6ee0b12fc95250ea5f1","created_at":"2024-03-18T06:43:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12146653600,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86CmAyszwAAAALT_zmg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12146653600","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-18T06:43:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
