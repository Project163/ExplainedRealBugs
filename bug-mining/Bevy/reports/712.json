Bevy version\n\nv0.15.3\n\n## Relevant system information\n\nWindows 11\n\n## What you did\n\nSetting the primary window to `visible = false` when setting up the `WindowPlugin`.\n\n## What went wrong\n\nThe application never actually starts running.\n\n## Additional information\n\nThe  [`window_setting`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/window/window_settings.rs) example does this to delay window visibility to \"avoid the white window that shows up before the GPU is ready to render the app\".\n\nThis bug was not present before v0.15.3 so I assume it comes from
