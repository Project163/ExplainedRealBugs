What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nIt is quite cumbersome to always have to write `Val::Px(40.0)` or `Val::Percent(100.0)`. This clutters the code and adds some boilerplate that makes it less readable, especially when doing a lot of UI stuff in one place. You always have to scan for `Val::` and then look at the type before looking at the value. This flow could be improved.\n\nAlso, a lot of times, you don't need the decimal point so this just adds to the boilerplate clutter.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nAdd a macro that translates CSS-like unit notation to the `Val` type.\n\nMy first proposal would be the following syntax:\n\n```rs\nval!(40px)  // Val::Px(40.0)\nval!(0)     // Val::Px(0.0) although this is debatable\nval!(auto)  // Val::Auto\nval!(70.4%) // Val::Percent(70.4)\n```\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nAdding helper functions as described in #15937. But this would have the downside of not having access to any characters such as `%`. Also, the syntax proposed here has the upside of being similar to the CSS syntax, making it easier to learn and understand.\n\n## Additional context\n\nI would be willing to implement this, but first I would like some feedback on the syntax and suggestions for additional features. Should the compiler/macro perform some checks for some of the values? I can't think of any, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nPlease give your opinion on this and if there is a general consensus that we should add something like this, I will implement it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20366/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20366/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"duplicate"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18953150939,"node_id":"MADE_lADODf6-U86aYdQ9zwAAAARpsiHb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18953150939","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"marked_as_duplicate","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-02T22:19:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3146789877","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15937#issuecomment-3146789877","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15937","id":3146789877,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U867kDP1","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-02T22:19:29Z","updated_at":"2025-08-02T22:21:34Z","body":"Copying my comment from the linked issue:\n\n> I am strongly opposed to adding macros to improve this.

Pixels by default? Or is there some kind of misunderstanding?\n\nBecause I don’t think setting a default unit is a good idea. It would complicate things for beginners especially due to the lack of missing documentation where such a thing could be documented. I did like the idea of helper functions that take something like `impl AsValNum`. (Or something similar, as long as the unit is explicit)\n\nPlease tell me if I’m overthinking anything.\n\nAlso, could you link to the discord discussion that you mentioned?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3148696564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TheBlckbird","id":66938161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTM4MTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66938161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBlckbird","html_url":"https://github.com/TheBlckbird","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBlckbird/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBlckbird/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBlckbird/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBlckbird/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBlckbird/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBlckbird/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBlckbird/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBlckbird/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBlckbird/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3148742558","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15937#issuecomment-3148742558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15937","id":3148742558,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U867rf-e","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-03T22:33:09Z","updated_at":"2025-08-03T22:33:09Z","body":"I see your point about the challenges around default units. The helper functions are a sensible idea.
