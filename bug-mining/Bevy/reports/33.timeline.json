into this I can see that Bevy doesn't call `Window::request_redraw()` when using `UpdateMode::Reactive` when needed.\r\nCurrently it only calls it when:\r\n- the user sends the [`RequestRedraw`](https://dev-docs.bevyengine.org/bevy/window/struct.RequestRedraw.html) event\r\n- when `DeviceEvent::MouseMotion` is received\r\n\r\nThis probably worked before because [`EventLoopWindowTarget::listen_device_events()`](https://docs.rs/winit/0.29.9/winit/event_loop/struct.EventLoopWindowTarget.html#method.listen_device_events) was supported with very few targets.\r\n\r\nSo the solution is to call `Window::request_redraw()` when actually required instead of relying on circumstantial events.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that Winit has set up a `bool`, `WinitAppRunnerState::redraw_requested`, to collect and call `Window::request_redraw()` later.

I noticed that [the whole `render_system` is not called](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/79021c78c629d97ef1207378a7ecf93bf4f0e6ce/crates/bevy_render/src/lib.rs#L395-L409) for some reason.\r\n\r\nIf Bevy isn't ready to draw when `RedrawRequested` is sent, it has to schedule a new one to render when it is. Otherwise nothing will happen.\r\n\r\n> * When pressing  and holding **down** the mouse left button, it keeps saying \"hover\"\r\n> * It only says \"pressed\" after **releasing** the mouse left button\r\n> * If I move afterward the mouse, it goes back to \"hover\"\r\n\r\nIf you move the mouse while holding it down it will actually update and show \"pressed\". This is because changes made to the button are only rendered in the next update cycle, not in the one they are changed in.\r\nKeep in mind I'm just describing what I'm observing, I don't actually know why any of this is the way it is.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly how the rendering system in Bevy works, but sending [`RequestRedraw`](https://dev-docs.bevyengine.org/bevy/window/struct.RequestRedraw.html) in [`Interaction::Pressed`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/79021c78c629d97ef1207378a7ecf93bf4f0e6ce/examples/ui/button.rs#L35-L39) fixes that issue.\r\n\r\nSo either Bevy has to correctly render the current state in the same call to `App::update()`, or it has to schedule another redraw after changes are made.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1879842763/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"daxpedda","id":1645124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDUxMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1645124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpedda","html_url":"https://github.com/daxpedda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpedda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpedda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpedda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpedda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpedda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpedda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpedda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpedda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daxpedda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"ThierryBerger","id":2290685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTA2ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2290685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThierryBerger","html_url":"https://github.com/ThierryBerger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThierryBerger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThierryBerger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThierryBerger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThierryBerger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThierryBerger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThierryBerger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThierryBerger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThierryBerger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThierryBerger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-07T12:18:46Z","updated_at":"2024-01-07T12:18:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11052","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11052/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11052/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11052/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11052","id":2052239088,"node_id":"I_kwDODf6-U856Uq7w","number":11052,"title":"Winit

few shortcuts were taken in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10702 in order to merge it in a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\nThis issue serves to :\r\n- coordinate addressing those follow-ups\r\n- offer a place to discuss the winit update\r\n- mentoring opportunities\r\n\r\nFeel free to create or ask a dedicated issue for any listed task, if you feel like it's worth it.\r\n\r\n## Known regressions (important follow ups?)\r\n- ⚠️ Fix big problem in event loop https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11052#issuecomment-1872498051\r\n  - [x] Preformance fix in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11227\r\n  - [ ] more eventloop cleanups : https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11227/files?diff=unified&w=1#diff-b1447f30819280931099e7498b2ced388a98de5cda1b631b493107bb96193cc0R806\r\n- [x] ⚠️ `UpdateMode::Reactive` is broken\r\n  - https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11235\r\n  - https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11320\r\n    - Fixed in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11325\r\n- [ ] Provide an API for reacting when a specific key from current layout was released.\r\n  - possible solutions: use winit::Key from winit::KeyEvent ; mapping between KeyCode and Key ; or retrieve exact layout.\r\n- [ ] We don't receive characters through alt+numpad (e.g. alt + 151 = \"ù\") anymore ; reproduced on winit example \"ime\". maybe related to https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/2945\r\n- [ ] (windows) Window content doesn't refresh at all when resizing. By reading https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/2900 ; I suspect we should just fire a `window.request_redraw();` from `AboutToWait`, and handle actual redrawing within `RedrawRequested`. I'm not sure how to move all that code so I'd appreciate it to be a follow up.\r\n- [x] (windows) unreleased winit fix for using set_control_flow in AboutToWait https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/3215\r\n  - Fixed in winit 0.29.4\r\n\r\n## Follow up \r\n\r\nI'd like to avoid bloating this PR, here are a few follow up tasks worthy of a separate PR, or new issue to track them once this PR is closed, as they would either complicate reviews, or at risk of being controversial:\r\n- [x] Cleanup `CanvasParentResizePlugin` (https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10702#discussion_r1417068856)\r\n  - [x] Remove `CanvasParentResizePlugin` https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11057\r\n  - [x] Allow to set canvas properties https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11052#issuecomment-1867411523 ; https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11057#issuecomment-1877869943\r\n    - 🚧 WIP: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11278\r\n- [ ] avoid mentionning explicitly winit in docs from bevy_window ?\r\n- [ ] `NamedKey` integration on bevy_input: https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/3143  introduced a new NamedKey variant. I implemented it only on the converters but we'd benefit making the same changes to bevy_input.\r\n- Add more info in `KeyboardInput` https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10702#pullrequestreview-1748336313\r\n  - [x] Done: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11400\r\n  - [ ] Update examples to use that feature (context: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11400#issuecomment-1898768973)\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/9905 added a workaround on a bug allegedly fixed by winit 0.29. We should check if it's still necessary.\r\n- [x] update to raw_window_handle 0.6\r\n  - Done: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11280\r\n- ~Rename `KeyCode` to `PhysicalKeyCode` https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10702#discussion_r1404595015~\r\n  - ~dropped: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11692~\r\n- [x] remove `instant` dependency, [replaced by](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/2836) `web_time`), we'd need to update to fastrand >= 2.0.\r\n  - With the asset rework we don't depend on fastrand anymore.\r\n- [ ] Verify license, see [discussion](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8745#discussion_r1402439800)\r\n  - we might be missing a short notice or description of changes made\r\n- [ ] Consider using https://github.com/rust-windowing/cursor-icon directly rather than vendoring it in bevy.\r\n- [x] investigate [this unwrap](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8745#discussion_r1387044986) (`winit_window.canvas().unwrap();`)\r\n  - Removed with https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11065\r\n- [ ] Call `pre_present_notify` https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11052#issuecomment-1900024414\r\n- Use more good things about winit's update\r\n  -

What you see is the queue_uinodes from the end of the render app of the previous frame, and the extract is from the next update which happens in parallel ?\r\n\r\nIn general, doesn't the pipelined renderer inevitably introduce a one frame delay between events and  associated render ?\r\n\r\n\r\nI have done some investigation on my side regarding the Reactive mode case here with the `button` example. And what I have seen is that the `RenderApp` is _stopped_ somewhere between its `ExtractCommands` set and its `Queue` set. The executor is waiting for one system to finish( i have not yet found exactly which one). This system is in direct relation with `winit` as it finishes when either there is an event or the 'wait delay' is reached.\r\n\r\nSo in ReactiveMode, the `ExtractCommands` part of the Render app is executed during the frame with the event, but not finished.\r\nThis perhaps also is in relation with the pipeline rendered, because the end of the RenderApp would be done on the next frame in parallel to the main update, but this next frame never happens ?\r\n \r\nThis is the best I have been able to go in debugging this, I don't have enough knowledge to really go further for the moment.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1917409917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BorisBoutillier","id":18518188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTE4MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18518188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BorisBoutillier","html_url":"https://github.com/BorisBoutillier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BorisBoutillier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BorisBoutillier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BorisBoutillier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BorisBoutillier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BorisBoutillier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BorisBoutillier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BorisBoutillier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BorisBoutillier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BorisBoutillier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1924247837","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11235#issuecomment-1924247837","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11235","id":1924247837,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U85ysbEd","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-02T16:42:36Z","updated_at":"2024-02-02T16:42:54Z","body":"This
