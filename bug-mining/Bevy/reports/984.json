Bevy version and features\n\n0.17.0-rc.1, default\n\n## Relevant system information\n\nchrome, firefox\n\n## What you did\n\nI encountered this while migrating [bevy_simple_prefs](https://github.com/rparrett/bevy_simple_prefs/tree/bevy-0.17).\n\nBut here's some minimized code that has the same panic (but has been modified slightly to use `check_ready`)\n\nI am running it with `bevy run web`.\n\n```rust\nuse bevy::{\n    ecs::world::CommandQueue,\n    prelude::*,\n    tasks::{Task, futures::check_ready},\n};\n\n#[derive(Component)]\npub struct LoadTask(pub Task<CommandQueue>);\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut app = App::new();\n    app.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins);\n    app.add_systems(Startup, test);\n    app.add_systems(Update, handle_tasks);\n    app.run();\n}\n\nfn test(world: &mut World) {\n    info!(\"Spawning task\");\n\n    let entity = world.spawn_empty().id();\n    let task = bevy::tasks::IoTaskPool::get().spawn(async move {\n        let mut command_queue = ::bevy::ecs::world::CommandQueue::default();\n        command_queue.push(move |world: &mut World| {\n            info!(\"Despawning task\");\n            world.despawn(entity);\n        });\n\n        command_queue\n    });\n\n    world.entity_mut(entity).insert(LoadTask(task));\n}\n\nfn handle_tasks(mut commands: Commands, mut transform_tasks: Query<&mut LoadTask>) {\n    for mut task in &mut transform_tasks {\n        if let Some(mut commands_queue) = check_ready(&mut task.0) {\n            info!(\"Adding queue to commands\");\n            commands.append(&mut commands_queue);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\n```\npanicked at /Users/me/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/bevy_tasks-0.17.0-rc.1/src/task.rs:143:44:\nPolled a task after it finished running\n```\n\n## Additional information\n\nSome [discussion](https://discord.com/channels/691052431525675048/692572690833473578/1417352268080087140) on discord.\n\nI also attempted rewriting `handle_tasks` as an exclusive system so I could apply the command queue immediately, but this panicked in the same way.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21079/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
