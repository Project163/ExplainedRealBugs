What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\n`bevy_utils` is a collection of unrelated utilities for Bevy. Utility modules/classes/libraries are generally frowned upon in the programming community since they are most likely a sign of poor organization.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nMove `bevy_utils`'s contents into existing bevy crates or into separate crates.\r\n\r\n### Long list of what to do with each item in `bevy_utils`\r\n\r\n- [ ] `BoxedFuture` could probably be removed since async in traits were added in Rust 1.75\r\n- [ ] all `HashMap` related stuff: no idea where to put that.\r\n- [x] https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11498\r\n- [ ] `OnDrop` could be its own crate\r\n- [ ] `tracing` related stuff: put in `bevy_log`\r\n- [ ] `once` related stuff: I would put it in `bevy_log`, but this could cause some issues (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11419)\r\n- [ ] `get_short_name`: put in `bevy_reflect`\r\n- [ ] `SyncCell`: use `std::sync::Exclusive` when stabilized (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/98407)\r\n- [ ] `SyncUnsafeCell`: use `std::cell::SyncUnsafeCell` when stablized (https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/95439)\r\n- [x] `generate_composite_uuid`: Maybe contribute this to the `uuid` crate?\r\n- [x] `label` module: Sounds like a `bevy_reflect` thing but isn't actually used anywhere there so idk\r\n- [x] `Interned`: put in `bevy_ecs`\r\n- [ ] `futures` module: only used in `bevy_render`, so put it there.\r\n- [x] `FloatOrd`: could be its own crate\r\n- [ ] `default`: Could be its own crate (The [`default` crate](https://crates.io/crates/default) already exists, so maybe we should use that)\r\n- [ ] `CowArc`: Could be its own crate\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11478/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
