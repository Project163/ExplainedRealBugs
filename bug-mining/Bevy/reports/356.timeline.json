Objective\r\nFixes #14884\r\n\r\nWe have launched the new [contributing guide](https://bevyengine.org/learn/contribute/introduction) on Bevy's website, so these sources of information should be

`docs/the_bevy_organization.md`.\r\n- `.github/contributing/engine_style_guide.md`.\r\n- `.github/contributing/example_style_guide.md`.\r\n\r\n#### These are replaced by:\r\n-

they look fine.
