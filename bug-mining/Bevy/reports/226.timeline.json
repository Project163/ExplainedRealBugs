Objective\r\n- Fixes #13445.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- Removes all `load_` methods from `LoadContext`.\r\n- Introduces `fn loader()` which returns a builder.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- I've tested with `cargo test --package=bevy_asset` and run the two relevant examples (`asset_processing` & `asset_decompression`).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n- Replaced all `load_` methods on `LoadContext` with the new `loader()` pattern.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n- Several LoadContext method calls will need to be updated:\r\n    - `load_context.load_with_settings(path, settings)` => `load_context.loader().with_settings(settings).load(path)`\r\n    - `load_context.load_untyped(path)` => `load_context.loader().untyped().load(path)`\r\n    - `load_context.load_direct(path)` => `load_context.loader().direct().load(path)`\r\n    - `load_context.load_direct_untyped(path)` => `load_context.loader().direct().untyped().load(path)`\r\n    - `load_context.load_direct_with_settings(path, settings)` => `load_context.loader().with_settings(settings).direct().load(path)`\r\n    - `load_context.load_direct_with_reader(reader, path)` => `load_context.loader().direct().with_reader(reader).load(path)`\r\n    - `load_context.load_direct_with_reader_and_settings(reader, path, settings)` => `load_context.loader().with_settings(settings).direct().with_reader(reader).load(path)`\r\n    - `load_context.load_direct_untyped_with_reader(reader, path)` => `load_context.loader().direct().with_reader(reader).untyped().load(path)`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCC @alice-i-cecile / @bushrat011899 \r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```rust\r\nload_context.loader()\r\n    .with_asset_type::<A>()\r\n    .with_asset_type_id(TypeId::of::<A>())\r\n    .with_settings(|mut settings| { settings.key = value; })\r\n    // Then, for a Handle<A>:\r\n    .load::<A>()\r\n    // Or, for a Handle<LoadedUntypedAsset>:\r\n    .untyped()\r\n    .load()\r\n    // Or, to load an `A` directly:\r\n    .direct()\r\n    .load::<A>()\r\n    .await\r\n    // Or, to load an `ErasedLoadedAsset` directly:\r\n    .direct()\r\n    .untyped()\r\n    .load()\r\n
