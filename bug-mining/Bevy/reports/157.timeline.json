I'd like to tackle this issue.\r\n\r\nI've got a good idea of how to check if the assets are fully loaded in the asset server, but not sure about how to confirm that a spawned visual asset such as a model is fully rendered. I thought I could use the `SceneInstanceReady` event, but it seems to be broadcasted before the scene is actually rendered to the screen. Would this coincide with the completed compilation of the shader pipelines? Or is there other stuff going on between the `SceneInstanceReady` event and the actual rendering of the scene?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2027946459/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Remi-Godin","id":129818497,"node_id":"U_kgDOB7zfgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129818497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remi-Godin","html_url":"https://github.com/Remi-Godin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remi-Godin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remi-Godin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remi-Godin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remi-Godin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remi-Godin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remi-Godin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remi-Godin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remi-Godin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Remi-Godin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2028482801","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12654#issuecomment-2028482801","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12654","id":2028482801,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U8546DDx","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-30T22:21:57Z","updated_at":"2024-03-30T22:21:57Z","body":"I
