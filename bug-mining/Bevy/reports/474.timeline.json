Objective\r\n\r\n- Closes #15716\r\n- Closes #15718\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Replace `Handle<MeshletMesh>` with a new `MeshletMesh3d` component\r\n- As expected there were some random things that needed fixing:\r\n  - A couple tests were storing handles just to prevent them from being dropped I believe, which seems to have been unnecessary in some.\r\n  - The `SpriteBundle` still had a `Handle<Image>` field. I've removed this.\r\n  - Tests in `bevy_sprite` incorrectly added a `Handle<Image>` field outside of the `Sprite` component.\r\n  - A few examples were still inserting `Handle`s, switched those to their corresponding wrappers.\r\n  - 2 examples that were still querying for `Handle<Image>` were changed to query `Sprite`\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- I've verified that the changed examples work now\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n`Handle` can no longer be used as a `Component`. All existing Bevy types using this pattern have been wrapped in their own semantically meaningful type. You should do the same for any custom `Handle` components your project needs.\r\n\r\nThe `Handle<MeshletMesh>` component is now `MeshletMesh3d`.\r\n\r\nThe `WithMeshletMesh` type alias has been removed. Use `With<MeshletMesh3d>`

this is what happens when you blithely decide that, since you're gonna need `bevy_ecs_tilemap` again soon, you may as well try to upgrade it for 0.15.

Some of the rendering stuff is well over my head! :sweat_smile: \r\n\r\nThis is _not_ a working update, but I'm leaving it here in case you can cherry pick some of the simpler commits to save you some time.

I'm by no means completely convinced by the naming scheme, and would welcome alternatives.
