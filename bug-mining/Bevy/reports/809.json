It still feels kinda hacky though.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @SkiFire13 in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17768#discussion_r1950383782_\r\n\r\nWhen working with default query filters, it's reasonably common to want to be agnostic to the presence of a given disabling component.\r\n\r\nCurrently, users can stick a `Has` or `Option` query data term in there, and get the desired behavior, but they often don't want the information contained in that term.\r\n\r\nWe should provide them with a query filter equivalent, which I think should be called `Includes<C>`. This filter would be absolutely useless for normal components, as it includes entities with or without C. But if we set the access up correctly, this should trick DQF into showing us the entities we want, regardless of whether or not they have C.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17803/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17803/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
