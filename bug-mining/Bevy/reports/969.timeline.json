once peoples' Bundles get big enough.\n\nMost of the time Bundles will be small enough that it doesn't matter, and I guess there may be an unwanted performance cost to *always* allocating the Bundle to spawn.  If the `children!` macro put its results into a `Box` or `Vec` that would alleviate the problem (and fixes the feathers example) but there's always the possibility someone wants to spawn enough big components in one entity that it still crashes.\n\nDon't know how explicit we want the spawn API to be -- should there be separate functions/macros for keeping parts off the stack?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3194637553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ejrh","id":2296764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTY3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2296764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejrh","html_url":"https://github.com/ejrh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejrh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejrh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejrh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejrh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejrh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejrh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejrh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejrh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejrh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3194647880","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20571#issuecomment-3194647880","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20571","id":3194647880,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86-anVI","user":{"login":"viridia","id":1166135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia","html_url":"https://github.com/viridia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-17T20:59:01Z","updated_at":"2025-08-17T20:59:01Z","body":"> Most of the time Bundles will be small enough that it doesn't matter\n\nWhile that may be true most of the time, it's not at all uncommon in UI work to spawn panels that have complex nested hierarchies.

Rust's [`std::thread`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/index.html#stack-size) documentation, it states that the default when spinning up new threads on al Tier 1 platforms (Windows included) is 2MiB, but the stack size on the main thread is not determined by Rust.\n\nThis rules out just upping the default stack size Bevy uses in its thread pool, albeit that is probably still a good idea with efforts like Forte utilizing stack allocation more aggressively.\n\nIn the intermediate term, it may be best to split up the Feathers example to piecemeal spawn/insert the components necessary.

We've never had problems with stack overflows spawning bundles before this, and it's specifically the deep nesting of the children hierarchy that is blowing up the size so much.\n\nI worry that if we fundamentally change the way that bundles are spawned this late in the game, we'll either end up leaking some of that change into the user-level API, or we'll notice a difference in performance. While boxing the children tuple will also have some performance impact, it's going to be much less: for a tree with an average fan-out factor of N, the number of `Children` components is generally going to be (number_of_nodes / N).\n\nThe CPU cost of additional heap allocations is only paid during spawning, a process which is already heap-intensive, so it may get lost in the wash. Maybe.
