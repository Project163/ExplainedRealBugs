What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nWhen working with cylindrical color spaces (see #12617) for more context, the `Mix` trait should always follow the shortest path, moving from e.g. orange to purple through red, rather than looping through green.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nWe should add tests to each of our cylindrical color spaces to ensure that this is (and continues to be) the case.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThis may make sense to tackle in the same PR as
