Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #21089 \r\n\r\nThe migration guide for the `zstd` feature changes didn't explain how to migrate from the old `zstd` feature to the new split features.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdded migration instructions showing that the old `zstd` feature should be replaced with either `zstd_rust` (safe default) or `zstd_c` (faster but unsafe).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Documentation change only, no code to test\r\n- Verified the feature change in git history (PR #19793)\r\n\r\n##\r\nLink to the issue:
