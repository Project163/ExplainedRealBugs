(Excluding the release candidate.) This means that we still have a chance to rename them before they become introduced to other projects, avoiding breaking changes in the future.","closed_by":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16081/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16081/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
