What we really need to know is whether https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16773 is still an issue after reverting https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/16828. And if so, if we can fix that issue in a way that doesn't cause the regression documented in *this issue*. It seems like that old issue could potentially be platform specific, or a driver issue or
