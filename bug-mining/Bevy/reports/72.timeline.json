#8266, so copy-pasting the description from there:\r\n\r\n# Objective\r\n\r\nSupport the KHR_texture_transform extension for the glTF loader.\r\n\r\n- Fixes #6335\r\n- Fixes #11869 \r\n- Implements part of #11350\r\n- Implements the GLTF part of #399 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAs is, this only supports a single transform. Looking at Godot's source, they support one transform with an optional second one for detail, AO, and emission. glTF specifies one per texture. The public domain materials I looked at seem to share the same transform. So maybe having just one is acceptable for now. I tried to include a warning if multiple different transforms exist for the same material.\r\n\r\nNote the gltf crate doesn't expose the texture transform for the normal and occlusion textures, which it should, so I just ignored those for now. (note by @janhohenheim: this is still the case)\r\n\r\nVia `cargo run --release --example scene_viewer ~/src/clone/glTF-Sample-Models/2.0/TextureTransformTest/glTF/TextureTransformTest.gltf`:\r\n\r\n![texture_transform](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/283864/228938298-aa2ef524-555b-411d-9637-fd0dac226fb0.png)\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Support for the [KHR_texture_transform](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_transform) extension added. Texture UVs that were scaled, rotated, or offset in a GLTF are now properly handled.\n- Added a new method `affine2_to_square` to the WGSL API. An Affine2 can be efficiently packed for the GPU as a `mat3x2`. This new methods unpacks that into a `mat3x3` that can be used to transform coordinates.\n- For consistency with the new `affine2_to_square`, we renamed `affine_to_square` to `affine3_to_square`\n\n## Migration guide\n\nRename `affine_to_square` to `affine3_to_square`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11904/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11904/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1962308891","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12081#issuecomment-1962308891","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12081","id":1962308891,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U8509nUb","user":{"login":"janhohenheim","id":9047632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDc2MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9047632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim","html_url":"https://github.com/janhohenheim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-24T09:23:21Z","updated_at":"2024-02-24T09:23:41Z","body":"@superdump the error is  `drawElementsInstanced: Buffer for uniform block is smaller than UNIFORM_BLOCK_DATA_SIZE.`\r\nLooks like our cool packing for `Affine2` is the problem, since the issue is gone if I pass a `Mat3` instead.

how)","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1962308891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"janhohenheim","id":9047632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDc2MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9047632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim","html_url":"https://github.com/janhohenheim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11910419939,"node_id":"MEE_lADODf6-U86AR2iIzwAAAALF6pXj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11910419939","actor":{"login":"superdump","id":302146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump","html_url":"https://github.com/superdump","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-24T09:23:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11910419940,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86AR2iIzwAAAALF6pXk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11910419940","actor":{"login":"superdump","id":302146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump","html_url":"https://github.com/superdump","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-24T09:23:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1962313471","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12081#issuecomment-1962313471","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12081","id":1962313471,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U8509ob_","user":{"login":"janhohenheim","id":9047632,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDc2MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9047632?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim","html_url":"https://github.com/janhohenheim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janhohenheim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-0

Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #12081\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nPassing the `Affine2` as a neatly packed `mat3x2` breaks WebGL with `drawElementsInstanced: Buffer for uniform block is smaller than UNIFORM_BLOCK_DATA_SIZE.`\r\nI fixed this by using a `mat3x3` instead.\r\nAlternative solutions that come to mind:\r\n- Pass in a `mat3x2` on non-webgl targets and a `mat3x3` otherwise. I guess I could use `#ifdef SIXTEEN_BYTE_ALIGNMENT` for this, but it doesn't seem quite right? This would be more efficient, but decrease code quality.\r\n- Do something about `UNIFORM_BLOCK_DATA_SIZE`. I don't know how, so I'd need some guidance here.\r\n\r\n@superdump let me know if you'd like me to implement other variants. Otherwise, I vote for merging this as a quick fix for `main` and then improving the packing in subsequent PRs :)\r\n\r\n## Additional notes\r\n\r\nIdeally we should merge this before @JMS55 rebases #10164 so that they don't have to rebase everything a second
