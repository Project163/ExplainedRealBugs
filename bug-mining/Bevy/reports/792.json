I start by collecting the meshes with `meshes.remove(handle)`, update the meshes in a `par_splat_map_mut`, then reinsert the meshes with `meshes.insert(handle, mesh)`.\n\nSimplified code: https://gist.github.com/g-pascal/eeab0d104fe8f2725b36c3bfb2c034e2\n\n## What went wrong\n\nThe process crashed after a few minutes due to a failed memory allocation. Looking at the Windows task manager it is quite clear there is a leak somewhere:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c9961c8-901c-4063-a638-157236d921c8\" width=400/>\n\n## Additional information\n\nThis seems related to https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16586 which fixed leaks caused by simply using `meshes.get_mut(handle)`. I'm having the same issue but when inserting an already allocated mesh with an existing handle:\n\n```rs\n    let mesh = meshes.remove(&*mesh_handle).unwrap();\n    // update mesh...\n    meshes.insert(mesh_handle, mesh);\n```\n\nThe leak also happens when the mesh is not updated at all, simply removing it and reinserting it causes the same issue.\n\nMinimal reproduction: https://gist.github.com/g-pascal/08ad6f56ea4699ecefb25cb65945ee75\n","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18808/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18808/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
