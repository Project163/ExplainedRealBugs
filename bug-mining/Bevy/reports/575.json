Does it even make sense to retain audio-related components, if sound is no longer playing?\r\n\r\nAs well as this comment on `PlaybackMode`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/f67b17d80d410045f0fb0af668521e2f91569159/crates/bevy_audio/src/audio.rs#L76-L79\r\n\r\nMotivated by a recent Discord discussion about \"how to replay a sound.\"\r\n\r\n## What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\n`PlaybackSettings` currently defaults to [`PlaybackMode::Once`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/audio/enum.PlaybackMode.html#variant.Once), meaning the audio will play once, and then the audio entity and its components are left alone and not despawned or removed.\r\n\r\nThat sounds convenient at first. After the `AudioSink` is created, it can be re-used, saving you the CPU cycles of spawning, despawning, and creating the sink. Or archetype-moves adding/removing components.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it really can't be reused. Once the audio in the sink's queue is played, it is gone, and there is no way for a user to refill the sink and start playback again. The only way I know of to restart audio is to remove the `AudioSink` component from the entity -- `play_queued_audio_system` will create a new one. That trick doesn't work for playing a different sound with the same sink. See #11862.\r\n\r\nSo why does this mode exist, and why is the default behavior to leak audio entities into the world and never clean them up?\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nMake the default behavior `PlaybackMode::Remove`, and add an internal system that cleans up \"orphaned\" entities when audio components are removed and the entity is otherwise \"empty.\"\r\n\r\nLeave `PlaybackMode::Once` around in case it is useful to someone. Add docs explaining why it's sort of useless?\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\n1. Make the default behavior `PlaybackMode::Despawn`. This is might be what users want most often. Leave `Once` in case it's useful to someone.\r\n2. Same, but remove `PlaybackMode::Once`.\r\n4. Keep current default behavior, remove the `TODO` comment.\r\n4. Add some sort of machinery for reusing a sink by refilling it or filling it with different audio.\r\n    \r\n    I naively attempted to add `append` to the `AudioSinkPlayback` trait, but it required making the trait generic, and it seemed like a mess. It's probably possible, but that route would lead to a pretty inconvenient API that seems counter to the \"ecs-based audio.\" Using change detection on `Handle<Source>` seems like it would be pretty funky too.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12359/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
