This was also [backported and released as v0.19.3](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/5327).\r\n\r\nThis means that pinning `web-sys` is no longer required. The following can be done:\r\n* Update the `wgpu` requirement in `bevy_render` from `0.19.1` to `0.19.3`.\r\n* Remove the `web-sys` pin.\r\n\r\nDoing so will unlock the ability for unrelated projects that have `bevy_render` in their workspace to finally update their `web-sys`.\r\n\r\nAlso, an additional benefit of the aforementioned `wgpu` change is that `wgpu` no longer requires you to have `--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis` in your `RUSTFLAGS`.
