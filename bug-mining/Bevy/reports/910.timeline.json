Solution\r\n\r\n- Modified the `on_insert` hook in the `Relationship` trait to detect one-to-one relationships (where the target collection type is `Entity`) and automatically remove any existing relationship before establishing the new one.\r\n- Uses runtime type checking with `TypeId` to identify one-to-one vs one-to-many relationships.\r\n- Safely removes the existing source relationship using `try_remove()` to handle edge cases gracefully.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Removed panic assertions from `Entity::add()` and `Entity::extend_from_iter()` methods that would previously crash when attempting to establish overlapping one-to-one relationships\r\n- Modified existing test `one_to_one_relationship_shared_target` by removing `#[should_panic]` and adding assertions to verify:\r\n  - Original relationship is properly removed\r\n  - New relationship is correctly established\r\n  - Target entity points to the new

Objective\r\n\r\n- Remove the default implementation of `extend_from_iter` from the RelationshipSourceCollection trait to standardize collection types providing their own implementation.\r\n- Fixes #20253\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Removed the default implementation of `extend_from_iter`\r\n- Added `extend_from_iter` implementation for BTreeSet that uses its native .extend() method\r\n- All other collection types (Vec, SmallVec, EntityHashSet, IndexSet, EntityIndexSet, Entity) already had their own implementations\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20255/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18780274799,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U87B-NxpzwAAAARfZEBv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18780274799","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6d72258c3febd5d6256047f41ecac99da7c8d120","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/6d72258c3febd5d6256047f41ecac99da7c8d120","created_at":"2025-07-23T18:24:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18780631203,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U87B-NxpzwAAAARfabCj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18780631203","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-23T18:45:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
