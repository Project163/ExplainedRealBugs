I just wanted to create same issue today because I stumbled upon this in my app.\nSo, I will enhance this issue with info and proposal, and, if maintainers agree on my vision, \n**I am happy and ready to tackle on implementing the code, docs, test and release notes.** 🙂\n\n## Proposal\n\nI want to add an `Initialize` schedule that *actually* runs the first no matter what.\n\n## What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nIn my game, I have a `Tree` component (the usual, wooden one). In order to keep separation of concerns, I only specify general required components via attributes on `Tree` itself, and split other by registering them via `world.register_required_components_with` in submodules. I hade previously done it in `PreStartup` schedule, but it works only if the game starts not in the `State` that somehow touches `Tree`s, or else I get `called Result::unwrap() on an Err value: ArchetypeExists(ComponentId(...))`.\n\nAs a side note - maybe this error should be improved somehow? Is this possible? Can tackle this too.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nSomething in the lines of:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(ScheduleLabel, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]\npub struct Initialize;\n\n...\n\nlet mut main_schedule_order = app.world_mut().resource_mut::<MainScheduleOrder>();\nmain_schedule_order.insert_startup_before(StateTransition, Initialize);\n```\n\nEdit: this is how I do it in my app, for bevy it should be probably inserted in `bevy_ecs` as the first, while `bevy_state` will insert `StateTransition` after `Initialize`, not before `PreStartup`.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\n1. Leaving as is, I think it is not great because it can be misleading.\n2. Making `Initialize` being *always* the first, no matter what user code does with schedules by making it a specific case in ECS internals. I think this will not add much value, and deny users in making some very special stuff that must run *before* `Initialize` (I haven't come up with a use case for that, but unnecessary limitations are not good in general I think).\n\nWaiting for blessing, I think I need your opinion

On the one hand, I agree with you, but on the other - `StateTransition` manages state of, well, `State`, so if your system relies on the correct `State` it can be useful to have some `bevy`-native

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nThe current schedule-based approach to state transitions is messy.\nIt allows for system ordering ambiguities (#13947), and forces users to reason about a once-per-frame `StateTransition` schedule (which other crates may add more copies of).\n\nState transitions hold important global invariants: we should use our new tools to make it easier (and more consistent) to reason about them.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\n1. Remove the `StateTransition` schedule.\n2. Make `State<T>` immutable (blocked on #17485).\n3. Remove `NextState`, and make users change states via commands.\n4. Use hooks to call the `OnEnter`/`OnExit`/`OnTransition` schedules when the state changes.\n5. Remove `.init_state` in favor of simply calling `.init_resource` on states. (Use a deprecation notice to make this easier).\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\n#18562 discusses the possibility of adding another schedule before the initial state transition to allow for startup systems to run before states are entered.\n\nI feel strongly that we shouldn't do this: it should be impossible to be in a state without its on-enter systems to be called (and similarly for on-exit). Instead, we should enforce this invariant as strongly as possible, and ensure that users have the tools needed to delay entering into states until any requisite setup is complete.\n\n## Additional context\n\nNote that this conflicts with the desire to run something *before* states are entered stated in #18562. However, users could simply initialize their starting states in a system during `Startup`, rather than calling `.init_state`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18583/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18583/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17024362897,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86v3ripzwAAAAP2uymR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17024362897","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d20f8553bfcad64f9c476567c786ffb4959c3953","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/d20f8553bfcad64f9c476567c786ffb4959c3953","created_at":"2025-03-28T01:33:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17024363227,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86v3ripzwAAAAP2uyrb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17024363227","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-28T01:33:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17039973373,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86v3ripzwAAAAP3qVv9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17039973373","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"11b35250651d2b42a0795fcde9d73222d1fd48ae","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/11b35250651d2b42a0795fcde9d73222d1fd48ae","created_at":"2025-03-28T22:33:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
