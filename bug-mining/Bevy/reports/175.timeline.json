Objective\r\n\r\nCloses #13017.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Make `AppExit` a enum with a `Success` and `Error` variant.\r\n- Make `App::run()` return a `AppExit` if it ever returns.\r\n- Make app runners return a `AppExit` to signal if they encountered a error.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- [`App::should_exit`](https://example.org/)\r\n- [`AppExit`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/app/struct.AppExit.html) to the `bevy` and `bevy_app` preludes,\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- [`AppExit`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/app/struct.AppExit.html) is now a enum with 2 variants (`Success` and `Error`).\r\n- The app's [runner function](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/app/struct.App.html#method.set_runner) now has to return a `AppExit`.\r\n- [`App::run()`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/app/struct.App.html#method.run) now also returns the `AppExit` produced by the runner function.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- Replace all usages of [`AppExit`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/app/struct.AppExit.html) with `AppExit::Success` or `AppExit::Failure`.\r\n- Any custom app runners now need to return a `AppExit`. We suggest you return a `AppExit::Error` if any `AppExit` raised was a Error. You can use the new [`App::should_exit`](https://example.org/) method.\r\n- If not exiting from `main` any other way. You should return the `AppExit` from `App::run()` so the app correctly returns a error code if anything fails e.g.\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() -> AppExit {\r\n    App::new()\r\n        //Your setup here...\r\n        .run()\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13022/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13022/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12563106920,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86GJAL4zwAAAALs0cxo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12563106920","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"de875fdc4ca06fa30440fd13c680f3d18f230987","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/de875fdc4ca06fa30440fd13c680f3d18f230987","created_at":"2024-04-22T17:02:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12563107250,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86GJAL4zwAAAALs0c2y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12563107250","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-22T17:02:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14911766325,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86GJAL4zwAAAAN4z381","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14911766325","actor":{"login":"teohhanhui","id":548843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODg0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/548843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui","html_url":"https://github.com/teohhanhui","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teohhanhui/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-26T19:59:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
