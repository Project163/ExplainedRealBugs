`transmission` example\n\n## What went wrong\n\nMaterials seem to get shuffled periodically\n\n## Additional information\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54ec41b7-fc8a-4274-92e2-58c99442355b\n\nTesting if it was tied to the rotation speed of the camera, i increased it's value, but no change on the frequency, it seems to be more tied to time, but commenting out the systems on `Update` stops the shuffling.\n\nThis might be a different issue but with the camera frozen (not rotating), the spheres with transmission on have a wavy behavior\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63052f27-c029-4d13-8596-ff765db6c824","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18102/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18102/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
