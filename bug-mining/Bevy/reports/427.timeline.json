Objective\r\n\r\nWorking with `World` is painful due to lifetime issues and a lack of ergonomics, so you may want to delegate to the system API. Your current options are:\r\n\r\n- `world.run_system_once`, which initializes the system each time it's called (performance cost) and doesn't support `Local`. The docs recommend users not use this method outside of diagnostic use cases like unit tests.\r\n- `world.run_system`, which requires you to register the system and store the `SystemId` somewhere (made easier by implementing `FromWorld` for a newtyped `Local`, unless you're in e.g. a custom `Command` impl).\r\n\r\nThese options work, but you're choosing between a performance cost and an ergonomic challenge.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nProvide a cached `run_system` API that accepts an `S: IntoSystem` and checks for a `CachedSystemId<S::System>(SystemId)` resource. If it doesn't exist, it will register the system and save its `SystemId` in that resource.\r\n\r\nIn other words, it hides the \"save the `SystemId` in a `Local` or `Resource`\" pattern as an implementation detail.\r\n\r\nPrior work: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10469.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThis approach worked in a proof-of-concept: https://github.com/benfrankel/bevy_jam_template/blob/b34ee29531e3ceae287a9cc44ec6c520e83a4cdd/src/util/patch/run_system_cached.rs#L35.\r\n\r\nA new unit test was added and it passes in

Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #15373\r\n- Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/14920#issuecomment-2370428013\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Make `IntoSystem::pipe` and `IntoSystem::map` return two new (possibly-ZST) types that implement `IntoSystem` and whose `into_system` method return the systems that were previously being returned by `IntoSystem::pipe` and `IntoSystem::map`\r\n- Don't eagerly call `IntoSystem::into_system` on the argument given to `RunSystemCachedWith::new` to avoid losing its ZST-ness\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Added a regression test for each issue\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- `IntoSystem::pipe` and `IntoSystem::map` now return `IntoPipeSystem` and `IntoAdapterSystem` instead of `PipeSystem` and `AdapterSystem`. Most notably these types don't implement `System` but rather only `IntoSystem`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15410/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14385781869,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86XeDDHzwAAAANZdZxt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14385781869","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fb9aaa152729e6e491ad27cbe5e91d9c7c103e2d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/fb9aaa152729e6e491ad27cbe5e91d9c7c103e2d","created_at":"2024-09-24T17:54:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14385782108,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86XeDDHzwAAAANZdZ1c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14385782108","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-24T17:54:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
