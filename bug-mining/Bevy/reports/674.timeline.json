we *sweep*, or remove entities from bins when those entities became invisible or changed phases, during `queue_material_meshes` and similar phases. This, however, is wrong, because `queue_material_meshes` executes once per material type, not once per phase. This could result in sweeping bins multiple times per phase, which can corrupt the bins. This commit fixes the issue by moving sweeping to a separate system that runs after queuing.\r\n\r\nThis manifested itself as entities appearing and disappearing seemingly at random.\r\n\r\nCloses #17759.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17787/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16256595529,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86pUg7ZzwAAAAPI9_ZJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16256595529","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"69db29efb99b3115777be6816e83f55805594096","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/69db29efb99b3115777be6816e83f55805594096","created_at":"2025-02-10T23:32:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16256595613,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86pUg7ZzwAAAAPI9_ad","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16256595613","actor":{"login":"superdump","id":302146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump","html_url":"https://github.com/superdump","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-10T23:32:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
