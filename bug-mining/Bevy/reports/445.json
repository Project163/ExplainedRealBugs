But on the check whether the key `A` was just pressed, I then spawn a window.\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nfn spawn_debug_window(input: Res<ButtonInput<KeyCode>>, mut commands: Commands) {\r\n    if input.just_pressed(KeyCode::F1) {\r\n        info!(\"just pressed\");\r\n        commands.spawn(Window {\r\n            title: \"Debug\".to_owned(),\r\n            ..Default::default()\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\nIt spams opening new windows, the `just_pressed` is held for multiple frames.\r\nI think this happens because it opens a new window, thus the focus is on the new window and the press counts as a new press?\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-03-03T11:54:46.916247Z  INFO my_project::debug: just pressed\r\n2024-03-03T11:54:46.930608Z  INFO bevy_winit::system: Creating new window \"Debug\" (25v4)\r\n2024-03-03T11:54:46.967434Z  INFO my_project::debug: just pressed\r\n2024-03-03T11:54:46.974474Z  INFO bevy_winit::system: Creating new window \"Debug\" (27v1)\r\n2024-03-03T11:54:47.014095Z  INFO my_project::debug: just pressed\r\n2024-03-03T11:54:47.036982Z  INFO bevy_winit::system: Creating new window \"Debug\" (29v1)\r\n2024-03-03T11:54:47.078519Z  INFO my_project::debug: just pressed\r\n2024-03-03T11:54:47.119463Z  INFO bevy_winit::system: Creating new window \"Debug\" (31v1)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
