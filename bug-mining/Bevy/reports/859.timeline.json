What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nCurrently, you cannot use `SpawnOneRelated` with `#[derive(Bundle)]` because this trait is not implemented.   Implementing, `BundleFromComponents` would allow for declarative `SpawnOneRelated` bundles. Here's an example from a project I was working on:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Bundle)]\npub struct TaskBundle {\n\tpub task: Task,\n\tpub render_state: RenderState,\n\tpub transform: Transform,\n\tpub visibility: Visibility,\n\tpub anchored_ui: SpawnOneRelated<\n\t\tAnchorUiNode,\n\t\t(\n\t\t\tAnchorUiConfig,\n\t\t\tbevy::prelude::Node,\n\t\t\tBackgroundColor,\n\t\t\tBorderColor,\n\t\t\tBorderRadius,\n\t\t\tbevy::prelude::TextColor,\n\t\t\tSpawnOneRelated<ChildOf, bevy::prelude::Text>,\n\t\t),\n\t>,\n}\n```\n\nWhich errors with...\n\n```\nthe trait bound `SpawnOneRelated<AnchorUiNode, (AnchorUiConfig, bevy::prelude::Node, BackgroundColor, BorderColor, BorderRadius, bevy::prelude::TextColor, SpawnOneRelated<bevy::prelude::ChildOf, bevy::prelude::Text>)>: BundleFromComponents` is not satisfied\n```\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nIt seems there are three options:\n\n1. I would imagine you can use the same [`unsafe impl`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/8b36cca28c4ea00425e1414fd88c8b82297e2b96/crates/bevy_ecs/src/bundle/impls.rs#L29-L40) as is used for `Component`. \n2. You could implement `BundleFromComponents` for [`Bundle`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/8b36cca28c4ea00425e1414fd88c8b82297e2b96/crates/bevy_ecs/src/spawn.rs#L404-L418) as this is implemented for `SpawnOneRelated`. I would imagine this many have many unintended side-effects, however.\n3. If something's amiss with 2, perhaps you can implement `Component` for `SpawnOneRelated`.\n\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nI can obviously just spawn imperatively. But, I like working towards type-safe programming. \n\n## Additional context\n\nI'm relatively new to Bevy, particularly more advanced uses of `bevy::ui`. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
