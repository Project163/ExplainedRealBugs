You can test by spawning a sprite and then resizing the window:\n\n```rust\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() -> AppExit {\n    App::new()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins.set(ImagePlugin::default_nearest()))\n        .add_systems(Startup, setup)\n        .run()\n}\n\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands, asset_server: Res<AssetServer>) {\n    commands.spawn(Camera2d);\n\n    commands.spawn(Sprite::from_image(asset_server.load(\"grid_480x270.png\")));\n}\n```\n\nThe notable exception is that it doesn't happen to sprites with dimensions that is the power of two (`512x256`, etc.).\n\nYou can test a more elaborate, interactive reproduction here: https://github.com/musjj/nearest_filter_bug. Slowly and gradually resize the window and you should be able to see the artifacts popping in and out.\n\n\n## What went wrong\n\nVisual tearing occurs.\n\n## Additional information\n\nAn example of **no** tearing:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e710f492-ae55-45f7-be54-8a0efa1ad830)\n\nAn example of tearing:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07b73db3-03f3-4c45-89a3-6be8ca004463)\n\n\nA closeup of the tearing (the lines are supposed to be perfectly straight):\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3482fa54-c955-4367-9843-f84aa70c2490)\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16773/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
