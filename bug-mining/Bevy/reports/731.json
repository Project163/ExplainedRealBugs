I've upgraded Tiny Glade's Bevy deps to `0.16.0-dev` to play around with auto-registration of reflection info, and I've noticed Rust Analyzer being sluggish. The Rust Analyzer slowdown is also reflected in running build/check/clippy. I've bisected it down to https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17330\n\nThe test I'm doing is touching/modifying a single .rs file in our chonkiest crate The numbers are best out of a few runs.\n\n### Using bevy at commit 669d139c13f6b44652f38131a5c9d20ca54e024d:\n* Rust Analyzer build (running `clippy`) after a ctrl+s: 6.53s\n* `cargo clippy`: 5.36s\n* `cargo check`: 1.98s\n* `cargo build` (touch one .rs file, no change): 3.03s\n* `cargo build`: (modify one function) 4.39s\n\n### Using bevy at commit 1b7db895b7ee71a2c2cfb8bd14eeb37c56ff9b44:\n* Rust Analyzer build (running `clippy`) after a ctrl+s: 12.40s\n* `cargo clippy`: 11.19s\n* `cargo check`: 7.83s\n* `cargo build` (touch one .rs file, no change): 8.78s\n* `cargo build` (modify one function): 10.18s\n\n## Before and After Traces\n\nTraces for touching a single .rs file and running `cargo build --timings`\n\n* Before: https://jsfiddle.net/fgyhduwn/\n* After: https://jsfiddle.net/Lv5sb6hr/\n\n\n## Additional information\n\nHere's our Bevy dependencies:\n\n```\nbevy_app = \"0.16.0-dev\"\nbevy_ecs = { version = \"0.16.0-dev\", features = [\"multi_threaded\", \"serialize\"] }\nbevy_input = { version = \"0.16.0-dev\", features = [\"serialize\"] }\nbevy_log = \"0.16.0-dev\"\nbevy_reflect = { version = \"0.16.0-dev\" }\nbevy_state = { version = \"0.16.0-dev\", default-features = false, features = [\"bevy_app\", \"bevy_reflect\"] }\nbevy_tasks = \"0.16.0-dev\"\nbevy_time = { version = \"0.16.0-dev\", default-features = false }\n```","closed_by":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18103/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18103/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
