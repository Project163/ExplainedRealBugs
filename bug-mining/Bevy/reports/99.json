Previously, the gizmo would simply fail to render. Fixing the issue, the gizmo still fails to render, so the crash is not actually protecting against some avoidable behavior.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nI'm hitting a \r\n```\r\nthread 'main' panicked at bevy_math-0.13.0/src/primitives/dim3.rs:40:9:\r\nassertion failed: value.is_normalized()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen trying to update `big_space` to 0.13. This happens when drawing the very large sphere gizmos. It turns out the issue is the rotation produced by `GlobalTransform::to_scale_rotation_translation()` is invalid, and is then panicking when the gizmo  creates an unchecked direction.\r\n\r\nMinimal repro:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nfn main() {\r\n    App::new()\r\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\r\n        .add_systems(Update, |mut gizmos: Gizmos| {\r\n            let rot = Quat::from_array([5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]); //.normalize();\r\n            gizmos\r\n                .sphere(Vec3::ZERO, rot, 1.0, Color::RED)\r\n                .circle_segments(128);\r\n        })\r\n        .run()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUncommenting the `normalize` will prevent the crash. Note that in my case, the bad `Quat` is being produced by `GlobalTransform::to_scale_rotation_translation`.","closed_by":{"login":"james7132","id":3137680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzc2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132","html_url":"https://github.com/james7132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
