This currently can only be done if a given component/resource has already been initialized (with `Components::get_id` and `Components::get_resource_id`).\r\n\r\nA specific example: a scripting language that wants to check for existance of a resource/component (on an entity) where the resource resource/component is defined in rust.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nFor `ReflectComponent`:\r\n- add a new function that takes `&mut World` and calls `world.init_component::<T>()`\r\n\r\nFor `ReflectResource`:\r\n- would require adding a new method to `World` that initializes a resource without inserting \r\n  - NOTE: based on current naming convention this should be called `init_resource` which is already used. #15451 proposes a rename of this group of methods. This would mean the new method would be called `register_resource<T>`\r\n  - NOTE: this is _different_ than #15448 as this method should return the same `ComponentId` for the same type if called multiple times\r\n- add a new function that takes `&mut World` and calls this new function\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\n- Require users to manually register all resources/components they are planning to use first (this is what I'm currently doing)\r\n- Somehow initialize all registered types that `#[reflect(Component, Resource)]` automatically when registering a type inside of the type registry.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15453/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15453/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
