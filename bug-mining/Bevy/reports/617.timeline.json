Objective\r\n\r\n- As stated in the linked issue, if a Mesh2D is drawn with elements with a positive Z value, resulting gizmos get drawn behind instead of in front of them. \r\n- Fixes #17053\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Similar to the change done for the `SpritePipeline` in the relevant commit (5abc32ceda1a440271c9f9ef71279bd9f7f9ff5c), this PR changes both line gizmos to avoid writing to the depth buffer and always pass the depth test to ensure they are not filtered out.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Tested with the provided snippet in #17053 \r\n- I looked over the `2d_gizmos` example, but it seemed like adding more elements there to demonstrate this might not be the best idea? Looking for guidance here on if that should be updated or if a new gizmo example needs to be made.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17085/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15816547791,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86kvFg4zwAAAAOuvV3P","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15816547791","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c87ec09674cf0ec32a37dea9ab03882f5b804b1e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/c87ec09674cf0ec32a37dea9ab03882f5b804b1e","created_at":"2025-01-05T02:20:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15816547799,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86kvFg4zwAAAAOuvV3X","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15816547799","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-05T02:20:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16172012853,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86kvFg4zwAAAAPD7VU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16172012853","actor":{"login":"twe4ked","id":71970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twe4ked","html_url":"https://github.com/twe4ked","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twe4ked/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twe4ked/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twe4ked/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twe4ked/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twe4ked/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twe4ked/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twe4ked/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twe4ked/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twe4ked/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-04T04:14:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16177165866,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86kvFg4zwAAAAPEO_Yq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16177165866","actor":{"login":"mrchantey","id":25616826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE2ODI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25616826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey","html_url":"https://github.com/mrchantey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/gists{/gist_id}","star
