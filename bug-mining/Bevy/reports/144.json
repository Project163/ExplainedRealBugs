Bevy version\r\n\r\nbevy = \"0.13.0\"\r\n\r\n## \\[Optional\\] Relevant system information\r\n\r\n- cargo 1.78.0-nightly (7065f0ef4 2024-03-12)\r\n- MacOS 14.4 (23E214)\r\n- Apple M1 CPU\r\n-  `AdapterInfo { name: \"Apple M1\", vendor: 0, device: 0, device_type: IntegratedGpu, driver: \"\", driver_info: \"\", backend: Metal }`\r\n- Also tested on Wasm in Firefox with the same result.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What you did\r\n\r\nI have been having a problem with a memory leak in my app. Here is a minimal example that reproduces the bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n\r\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    App::new()\r\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\r\n        .insert_resource(Objects::default())\r\n        .add_systems(Startup, setup)\r\n        .add_systems(Update, update)\r\n        .run();\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Resource, Default)]\r\nstruct Objects {\r\n    mesh: Handle<Mesh>,\r\n    material: Handle<StandardMaterial>,\r\n    scene: Handle<Scene>,\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Component)]\r\nstruct Piece;\r\n\r\nfn setup(\r\n    mut commands: Commands,\r\n    mut objects: ResMut<Objects>,\r\n    mut meshes: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>,\r\n    mut materials: ResMut<Assets<StandardMaterial>>,\r\n    asset_server: Res<AssetServer>,\r\n) {\r\n    commands.spawn(Camera3dBundle {\r\n        transform: Transform::from_xyz(7., 15., -9.5).looking_at(Vec3::ZERO, Vec3::Y),\r\n        camera: Camera {\r\n            clear_color: ClearColorConfig::Custom(Color::rgb(0., 0.7, 0.89)),\r\n            ..default()\r\n        },\r\n        ..default()\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    objects.mesh = meshes.add(Cuboid::new(1.0, 1.0, 1.0));\r\n    objects.material = materials.add(Color::rgb_u8(124, 144, 255));\r\n    objects.scene = asset_server.load(format!(\"tree_1.glb#Scene0\"));\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn update(mut commands: Commands, objects: Res<Objects>, delete_query: Query<Entity, With<Piece>>) {\r\n    for entity in delete_query.iter() {\r\n        commands.entity(entity).despawn_recursive();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    for i in 1..1000 {\r\n        commands\r\n            .spawn(PbrBundle {\r\n                mesh: objects.mesh.clone(),\r\n                material: objects.material.clone(),\r\n                transform: Transform::from_xyz(0.0, 0.0, i as f32),\r\n                ..default()\r\n            })\r\n            .insert(Piece);\r\n\r\n        // The previous expression doesn't seem to have an effect\r\n        // but the memory steadily increases when the following expression is included.\r\n        commands\r\n            .spawn(SceneBundle {\r\n                scene: objects.scene.clone(),\r\n                transform: Transform::from_xyz(0.0, 1., i as f32).with_scale(Vec3::splat(0.05)),\r\n                ..Default::default()\r\n            })\r\n            .insert(Piece);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, entities are cleared and then added again, repeatedly. The problem still happens if there is some time between runs (e.g. once every second) but it just happens a bit slower.\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\nThe app memory usage steadily increases.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nIt may be that some part of the loaded scene is not being properly deleted. I am not sure.\r\n\r\nPotentially related to #9035 but it seems to not be an exclusively MacOS issue, given that I tried it on Wasm as well.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12746/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
