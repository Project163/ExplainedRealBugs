catch!\n\nThis became visible in #17687 because that fixed the \"duplicate entities on spawn\" bug introduced in #17398. But the reordering was actually introduced in #17398.\n\nThe problem is that we're spawning a flat (arbitrarily ordered) list of entities in the SceneSpawner (ex: iter archetypes, spawn each entity in the archetype). We ignore the `Children` component, meaning we are spawning entities, some of which have ChildOf, and letting the arbitrary spawn order determine the final order of the Children. Definitely not shippable behavior.\n\nThe original RelationshipTarget is the only thing holding the order information. We cannot discard it.\n\nSome options:\n\n1. Spawn hierarchically, which would ensure the order is preserved (ex: spawn starting from a list of roots, and then trigger spawns for all relationshiptarget components with LINKED_SPAWN). This would _largely_ fix the problem. But for any non-LINKED_SPAWN relationships, their order would still be lost (and therefore this isn't a compelling option). And spawning in archetype order also has better memory access patterns in theory (although its hard to say if we're actually getting benefits from that cache friendliness here).\n2. We could do a final \"fixup pass\" where we replace all relationship target entities with a mapped version of their original collection. This has the downside of doing all of the \"setup code\" with the wrong order, then doing additional work to fix it up retroactively. This overhead puts it in the \"last-resort-hack\" category for me. \n3. We could spawn the mapped version of the collection, and then somehow suppress the Relationship (ex: ChildOf) insert hook logic to avoid inserting the out-of-order duplicates. This could be accomplished efficiently with a flag on `World` or something, which we set when spawning / cloning and reset when finished.\n4. We could \"reverse\" the process: spawn a mapped version of the RelationshipTarget collection, fully ignore the Relationship component (to avoid inserting duplicates), and then drive the inserts of the Relationship component _via_ the RelationshipTarget collection. This has the downside of forcing archetype moves unnecessarily (spawning without ChildOf and then inserting later is an archetype move). The approach on `main` does not (theoretically) suffer from unnecessary archetype moves, as we can spawn the empty Children (preallocated with the space necessary for each child) and the children are each spawned directly with ChildOf. In practice `main` still has archetype moves because we're spawning each component one-by-one, but that will change once we switch to using the EntityCloner to spawn.\n\nI _was_ leaning toward (3), as it seemed like our \"least bad\" option. It preserves order across all relationship types, doesn't introduce overhead (just one more branch ... and in fact it is actually faster because we're skipping the insert code), and it allows us to spawn/clone in arbitrary orders (including cache-efficient orders like iterating archetypes or tables). We can trust that the contents of the RelationshipTarget collections are valid, as they were generated via the normal hooks flows.\n\nSadly it has a fatal flaw: cloning can trigger hooks/observers, which can trigger arbitrary spawns. In those cases, with a global flag the triggered spawns wouldn't properly maintain their relationships. This means we need this configuration to be properly scoped to the call (ex: add a new set of spawn / insert methods that pass the relevant information to the hook so it can skip only where relevant).\n\nSo thats what I'm leaning toward now.

#17720\r\n\r\n## Objective\r\n\r\nSpawning RelationshipTargets from scenes currently fails to preserve RelationshipTarget ordering (ex: `Children` has an arbitrary order). This is because it uses the normal hook flow to set up the collection, which means we are pushing onto the collection in _spawn order_ (which is currently in archetype order, which will often produce mismatched orderings).\r\n\r\nWe need to preserve the ordering in the original RelationshipTarget collection. Ideally without expensive checking / fixups.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to spawn in hierarchy-order. However this gets complicated as there can be multiple hierarchies, and it also means we can't spawn in more cache-friendly orders (ex: the current per-archetype spawning, or future even-smarter per-table spawning). Additionally, same-world cloning has _slightly_ more nuanced needs (ex: recursively clone linked relationships, while maintaining _original_ relationships outside of the tree via normal hooks).\r\n\r\nThe preferred approach is to directly spawn the remapped RelationshipTarget collection, as this trivially preserves the ordering. Unfortunately we can't _just_ do that, as when we spawn the children with their Relationships (ex: `ChildOf`), that will insert a duplicate.\r\n\r\nWe could \"fixup\" the collection retroactively by just removing the back half of duplicates, but this requires another pass / more lookups / allocating twice as much space. Additionally, it becomes complicated because observers could insert additional children, making it harder (aka more expensive) to determine which children are dupes and which are not.\r\n\r\nThe path I chose is to support \"opting out\" of the relationship target hook in the contexts that need that, as this allows us to just cheaply clone the mapped collection. The relationship hook can look for this configuration when it runs and skip its logic when that happens. A \"simple\" / small-amount-of-code way to do this would be to add a \"skip relationship spawn\" flag to World. Sadly, any hook / observer that runs _as the result of an insert_ would also read this flag. We really need a way to scope this setting to a _specific_ insert.\r\n\r\nTherefore I opted to add a new `RelationshipInsertHookMode` enum and an `entity.insert_with_relationship_insert_hook_mode` variant. Obviously this is verbose and ugly. And nobody wants _more_ insert variants. But sadly this was the best I could come up with from a performance and capability perspective. If you have alternatives let me know!\r\n\r\nThere are three variants:\r\n\r\n1. `RelationshipInsertHookMode::Run`: always run relationship insert hooks (this is the default)\r\n2. `RelationshipInsertHookMode::Skip`: do not run any relationship insert hooks for this insert (this is used by spawner code)\r\n3. `RelationshipInsertHookMode::RunIfNotLinked`: only run hooks for _unlinked_ relationships (this is used in same-world recursive entity cloning to preserve relationships outside of the deep-cloned tree)\r\n\r\nNote that I have intentionally only added \"insert with relationship hook mode\" variants to the cases we absolutely need (everything else uses the default `Run` mode), just to keep the code size in check. I do not think we should add more without real _very necessary_ use cases.\r\n\r\nI also made some other minor tweaks:\r\n\r\n1. I split out `SourceComponent` from `ComponentCloneCtx`. Reading the source component no longer needlessly blocks mutable access to `ComponentCloneCtx`.\r\n2. Thanks to (1), I've removed the `RefCell` wrapper over the cloned component queue.\r\n3. (1) also allowed me to write to the EntityMapper while queuing up clones, meaning we can reserve entities during the component clone and write them to the mapper _before_ inserting the component, meaning cloned collections can be mapped on insert.\r\n4. I've removed the closure from `write_target_component_ptr` to simplify the API / make it compatible with the split `SourceComponent` approach.\r\n5. I've renamed `EntityCloner::recursive` to `EntityCloner::linked_cloning` to connect that feature more directly with `RelationshipTarget::LINKED_SPAWN`\r\n6. I've removed `EntityCloneBehavior::RelationshipTarget`. This was always intended to be temporary, and this new behavior removes the need for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17858/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"rparrett","id":200550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett","html_url":"https://github.com/rparrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-25T13:47:17Z","updated_at":"2025-02-25T13:47:17Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18029","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18029/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18029/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18029/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18029","id":2878437542,"node_id":"I_kwDODf6-U86rkXim","number":18029,"title":"runtime
