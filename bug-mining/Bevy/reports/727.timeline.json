The problem is that applying a command queue requires exclusive access to it (both because running commands consumes them and to clear the queue), and a system's command queue is stored in the system itself.\n\nTo fix this, I think need to move the command queue out of the system and then double buffer them. Iirc flecs uses a thread-local queue?\n\n> Apparently i can just go with observers since i was told they can recursivly call themself, which i tried to avoid since in my use case it's mean 500 entities, one for each effect), but in the end it's probably nothing and have 0 perf issue.\n\nShould be fine, as entities shouldn't hurt performance just by existing.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2684648928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SpecificProtagonist","id":30270112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjcwMTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30270112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist","html_url":"https://github.com/SpecificProtagonist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2686720970","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18030#issuecomment-2686720970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18030","id":2686720970,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86gJBvK","user":{"login":"grind086","id":6655984,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTU5ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6655984?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086","html_url":"https://github.com/grind086","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grind086/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-27T02:50:45Z","updated_at":"2025-02-27T02:50:45Z","body":"There's a note about this on [`World::run_system`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/prelude/struct.World.html#method.run_system).\n\nAfter some testing it looks like you *can* make it work with a custom `System` implementation that unconditionally uses `System::queue_deferred` instead of `System::apply_deferred`.
