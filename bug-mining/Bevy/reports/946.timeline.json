What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nThe current version of the atmosphere pipeline does not support space views or affect PBR directional lights. I want to have a realistic physically based lighting model instead of just a composited post processing effect.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\n- Switch to using a spherical coordinate system should be supported with a custom origin point\n- Add ray-marched rendering to the atmosphere to support space-views\n- Directional lights should be affected by sampling the transmittance texture, for instance objects lit with directional lights should turn orange at sunset.\n- Add environment map reflections dynamically generated by the atmosphere renderer, plug it into the environment filtering pipeline to get the diffuse environment map lighting information and specular reflections mip chain at different roughness levels. \n- Expose control to the user for the angular size of the sun.\n\n## Additional context\n\nWe landed the environment map filtering in this pull request: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19076\n\nTherefore the Atmosphere PBR integration PR became unblocked: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19037\n\nWe saw overall positive feedback for this pull request (13 ❤️ ! ) and it makes me think that it's an important feature to land in Bevy. \n\nI continued work in another PR in my branch of Bevy and got some useful feedback: https://github.com/mate-h/bevy/pull/10\n\nThe overall longer term goal is outlined in this issue: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18151\n\n## Conclusion \n\nThis is a tracking issue in the Bevy repo and will try a different approach this time to merge this. I will be posting a series of smaller PRs that reduces the burden on maintainers to review large changes. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20374/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20374/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"JMS55","id":47158642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTU4NjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47158642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55","html_url":"https://github.com/JMS55","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JMS55/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-26T17:07:59Z","updated_at":"2025-08-26T17:07:59Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20766","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20766/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20766/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20766/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/20766","id":3356443089,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86ldCXH","number":20766,"title":"Raymarched rendering for atmosphere and spherical coordinates","user":{"login":"mate-h","id":14351670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzUxNjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14351670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h","html_url":"https://github.com/mate-h","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Feature","name":"C-Feature","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A new feature, making something new possible"},{"id":2045383863,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQ1MzgzODYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-Rendering","name":"A-Rendering","color":"C6A751","default":false,"description":"Drawing game state to the screen"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.
