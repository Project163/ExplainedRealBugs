Stack trace attached, **updated** for latest commit d95313bdb8 and to remove my printlns so the line numbers are more accurate,\n\n[stacktrace.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21767515/stacktrace.txt)\n\nI don't think the color slider code added in this commit causes the problem, except insofar as the \"impl Bundle\" returned by `demo_root` has grown larger.\n\nThe problem does not occur in release mode, nor if I remove some of the nodes added in `demo_root`.  Removing either all the newly-added color sliders, or all the pre-existing widgets and leaving the color sliders intact seems to work.\n\nMy theory would be either endless function recursion, or an excessive frame size in a function call.  I am not an expert on Windows or Rust compilation, so I have mostly made progress by adding \"println!\" macros at various places.  The `setup` system completes but another system set to run straight afterwards never gets to run:\n\n    ...\n    app.add_systems(Startup, print_stuff.after(setup));\n    ...\n\n    fn print_stuff() {\n        println!(\"stuff!\");     // this isn't printed\n    }\n\nAdding more printing, it seems that all the individual commands are applied in `apply_or_drop_queued`, but then it's not clear if control ever returns to the caller.  Maybe some Drop code runs and that's where it all goes wrong.\n","closed_by":{"login":"james7132","id":3137680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzc2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132","html_url":"https://github.com/james7132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20571/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
