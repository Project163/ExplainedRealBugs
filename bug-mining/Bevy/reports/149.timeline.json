Objective\r\n\r\nOn a real iOS device, buttons are sometimes unresponsive when tapped for the first time.\r\n\r\n`ui_focus_system` needs to obtain the touch position through `Touches`'s `pressed`, but `pressed` is sometimes cleared because both `TouchPhase::Started` and `TouchPhase::Ended` are triggered in the same frame.
