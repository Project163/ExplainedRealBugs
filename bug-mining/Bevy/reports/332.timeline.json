Objective\r\n\r\n- Upgrade winit to v0.30\r\n- Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13331\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis is a rewrite/adaptation of the new trait system described and implemented in `winit` v0.30.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThe custom UserEvent is now renamed as WakeUp, used to wake up the loop if anything happens outside the app (a new [custom_user_event](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/13366/files#diff-2de8c0a8d3028d0059a3d80ae31b2bbc1cde2595ce2d317ea378fe3e0cf6ef2d) shows this behavior.\r\n\r\nThe internal `UpdateState` has been removed and replaced internally by the AppLifecycle. When changed, the AppLifecycle is sent as an event.\r\n\r\nThe `UpdateMode` now accepts only two values: `Continuous` and `Reactive`, but the latter exposes 3 new properties to enable reactive to device, user or window events. The previous `UpdateMode::Reactive` is now equivalent to `UpdateMode::reactive()`, while `UpdateMode::ReactiveLowPower` to `UpdateMode::reactive_low_power()`.\r\n\r\nThe `ApplicationLifecycle` has been renamed as `AppLifecycle`, and now contains the possible values of the application state inside the event loop: \r\n* `Idle`: the loop has not started yet\r\n* `Running` (previously called `Started`): the loop is running\r\n* `WillSuspend`: the loop is going to be suspended\r\n* `Suspended`: the loop is suspended\r\n* `WillResume`: the loop is going to be resumed\r\n\r\nNote: the `Resumed` state has been removed since the resumed app is just running.\r\n\r\nFinally, now that `winit` enables this, it extends the `WinitPlugin` to support custom events.\r\n\r\n## Test platforms\r\n\r\n- [x] Windows\r\n- [x] MacOs\r\n- [x] Linux (x11)\r\n- [x] Linux (Wayland)\r\n- [x] Android\r\n- [x] iOS\r\n- [x] WASM/WebGPU\r\n- [x] WASM/WebGL2\r\n\r\n## Outstanding issues / regressions\r\n\r\n- [ ] iOS: build failed in CI\r\n   - blocking, but may just be flakiness\r\n- [x] Cross-platform: when the window is maximised, changes in the scale factor don't apply, to make them apply one has to make the window smaller again.

Objective\r\n\r\nAdds a new `Monitor` component representing a winit `MonitorHandle` that can be used to spawn new windows and check for system monitor information.\r\n\r\nCloses #12955.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nFor every winit event, check available monitors and spawn them into the world as components.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Test plugging in and unplugging monitor during app runtime\r\n- [x] Test spawning a window on a second monitor by entity id\r\n- [ ] Since this touches winit, test all platforms\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Adds a new `Monitor` component that can be queried for information about available system monitors.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- `WindowMode` variants now take a `MonitorSelection`, which can be set to `MonitorSelection::Primary` to mirror the old
