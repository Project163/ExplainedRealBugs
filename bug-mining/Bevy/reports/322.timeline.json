believe the issues is either in\r\n\r\n1. `TextureAtlas::from_grid` not calculating size as expected.\r\n2. `extract_atlas_uinodes` using `TextureAtlas::size` instead of the size of the actual texture.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure what a \"correct\" fix would be.\r\n\r\n`1` seems slightly problematic if `TextureAtlas::size` is supposed to be exactly the texture size, because the `offset` param is ambiguous about whether the texture has the \"offset area\" on its right and bottom sides as well. In practice, I would expect that it's far more common for users to have atlases with the \"offset\" on all sides. It would probably be worth investigating whether `from_grid` can be used to load a \"sub-sheet\" from a larger atlas, and how that behaves in a non-ui `TextureAtlasSprite`. If that needs to work, then fixing `1` feels pointless.\r\n\r\n`2` seems problematic, because after #10520, we can no longer access the actual texture size where it is needed.\r\n\r\nSo I think the right call is probably to fix `1` by adding `2. * offset` to size in `TextureAtlas::from_grid`. But I am very unfamiliar with UI rendering so there may be some better solution.\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround for end users, which is to set the `TextureAtlas`'s size to the correct value after it is created:\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut atlas = TextureAtlasLayout::from_grid(\r\n    UVec2::new(12, 12),\r\n    103,\r\n    50,\r\n    Some(UVec2::splat(1)),\r\n    Some(UVec2::splat(1)),\r\n);\r\n//

Is there anything specific they need to know?\r\n\r\nExample in #11219\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nlet ui_node = ExtractedUiNode {\r\n                    stack_index,\r\n                    transform,\r\n                    color,\r\n                    rect,\r\n                    image,\r\n-                   atlas_size: Some(atlas_size * scale_factor),      \r\n+                   atlas_scaling: Some(Vec2::splat(scale_factor)),\r\n                    clip,\r\n                    flip_x,\r\n                    flip_y,\r\n                    camera_entity,\r\n                    border,\r\n                    border_radius,\r\n                    node_type,\r\n                },\r\n```\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nlet computed_slices = ComputedTextureSlices {\r\n    slices,\r\n-    image_size,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13620/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13698111865,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U857KdNSzwAAAAMweJl5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13698111865","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ba09f354745b1c4420e6e316d80ac97c9eb37f56","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/ba09f354745b1c4420e6e316d80ac97c9eb37f56","created_at":"2024-07-30T15:49:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13698112077,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U857KdNSzwAAAAMweJpN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13698112077","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-30T15:49:34Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
