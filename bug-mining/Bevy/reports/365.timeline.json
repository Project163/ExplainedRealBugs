Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #14883\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nPretty simple update to `EntityCommands` methods to consume `self` and return it rather than taking `&mut self`. The things probably worth noting:\r\n\r\n* I added `#[allow(clippy::should_implement_trait)]` to the `add` method because it causes a linting conflict with `std::ops::Add`.\r\n* `despawn` and `log_components` now return `Self`. I'm not sure if that's exactly the desired behavior so I'm happy to adjust if that seems wrong.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTested with `cargo run -p ci`. I think that should be sufficient to call things good.\r\n\r\n## ~~Migration (REVERTED) Guide~~\r\n\r\nThe most likely migration needed is changing code from this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        let mut entity = commands.get_or_spawn(entity);\r\n\r\n        if depth_prepass {\r\n            entity.insert(DepthPrepass);\r\n        }\r\n        if normal_prepass {\r\n            entity.insert(NormalPrepass);\r\n        }\r\n        if motion_vector_prepass {\r\n            entity.insert(MotionVectorPrepass);\r\n        }\r\n        if deferred_prepass {\r\n            entity.insert(DeferredPrepass);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nto this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        let mut entity = commands.get_or_spawn(entity);\r\n\r\n        if depth_prepass {\r\n            entity = entity.insert(DepthPrepass);\r\n        }\r\n        if normal_prepass {\r\n            entity = entity.insert(NormalPrepass);\r\n        }\r\n        if motion_vector_prepass {\r\n            entity = entity.insert(MotionVectorPrepass);\r\n        }\r\n        if deferred_prepass {\r\n            entity.insert(DeferredPrepass);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nas can be seen in several of the example code updates here. There will probably also be instances where mutable `EntityCommands` vars no longer need to be mutable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14897/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14017301985,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86T7wO5zwAAAANDfw3h","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14017301985","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"484721be80aa15db3fbea547396c9d9fe36a5d8a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/484721be80aa15db3fbea547396c9d9fe36a5d8a","created_at":"2024-08-26T18:25:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14017489777,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86T7wO5zwAAAANDgetx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14017489777","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-26T18:41:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2359665443","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14883#issuecomment-2359665443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14883","id":2359665443,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86MpaMj","user":{"login":"crvarner","id":10468631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDY4NjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10468631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner","html_url":"https://github.com/crvarner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crvarner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-19T00:21:15Z","updated_at":"2024-09-19T00:22:05Z","body":"@alice-i-cecile just ran into this breaking avian3d (easy to fix), but thought it was worth pointing out it definitely does break some things.

             The addition of `insert_if` is indeed nice. I was commenting purely on methods now consuming `self`. I realize now that I wasn't clear about that in my earlier comments, sorry about that\r\n\r\nWithin the changes in this PR I counted 6 cases where the change to consuming `self` enabled chaining.\r\nOn the other hand I counted 15 instances where doing re-assignment (`entity_commands = entity_commands.XXX()`) was now necessary.\r\n\r\nIMO, that's not looking great.\r\n\r\n> I'd like to keep the API in place for the RC, see how the ecosystem at large reacts to it\r\n\r\nRight, we do have release candidates now.
