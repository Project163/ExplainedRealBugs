This is good! \n\nCurrently it queues a new background task on a more or less fixed interval, and gates the total number of tasks to be half the number of workers in the pool. This approach has several flaws:\n+ It relies on information about the workers in the thread pool, which may not be available or consistent on all platforms.\n+ It adds redundant load to the pool.\n+ It can theoretically result in diagnostics being polled too frequently, resulting in garbage output.\n+ It can theoretically deliver polling results out of order.\n\nTo avoid these issues, `bevy_diagnostic` should spawn a *single task* which:\n1. Waits for the min-update period to pass.\n2. Polls cpu the diagnostics.\n3. Reschedules itself.\n\nThis can be easily implemented as a custom `Future` that always returns `Poll::Pending`, and which transmits results intermittently using an async-channel. The future can re-schedule itself eagerly, and read the CPU data only when enough time has passed since the previous update.\n\nHere is a rough sketch:\n\n```rust\nstruct DiagnosticJob {\n    last_refresh: Option<Instant>,\n    data_rx: Sender<SysinfoRefreshData>\n}\n\nimpl Future for DiagnosticJob {\n    type Output = ();\n\n    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<()> {\n        // Reschedule this task\n        cx.waker().wake_by_ref()\n        // Determine if it's time to run diagnostics\n        let run_diagnotsic = self\n            .last_refresh.map(|t| t.elapsed() > MINIMUM_CPU_UPDATE_INTERVAL)\n            .unwrap_or(true);\n        // Run the diagnostics\n        if run_diagnostic {\n            let data = get_diagnostic_data();\n            self.data_rc.send(data);\n            self.last_refresh = Some(Instant::now());\n        }\n        // Yeild to the executor\n        Poll::Pending\n    }\n```","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
