The way it works today, you can't do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfn create_button<'a>(parent: &'a mut ChildBuilder) -> EntityCommands<'a> {\r\n    parent\r\n        .spawn(ButtonBundle::default())\r\n        .with_children(|parent| {\r\n            parent.spawn(TextBundle::default());\r\n        })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause `spawn` creates a temporary that can't be returned from here. A key to this is that the method is taking in a `ChildBuilder`, not a `Commands`, implying that it's being used from within a call to `with_children`. Normally a method like this might return the `Entity` instead and then the caller would use `Commands` to further modify it, but that isn't possible here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    commands\r\n        .spawn(ButtonBundle::default())\r\n        // this fails to build because commands is being held mutably in the outer call to spawn\r\n        // and can't be accessed within the closure\r\n        .with_children(|parent| {\r\n            let ent = parent.spawn(TextBundle::default()).id();\r\n            commands.entity(ent).insert(TextBundle::default());\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot being able to do this makes composing more complex, reusable UI structures somewhat difficult I think and I believe making the change to have those `EntityCommands` methods consume and return self would fix that without breaking anything else?\r\n\r\nI've also tried resolving this by returning from `create_button` with [reborrow](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.14.1/bevy/ecs/system/struct.EntityCommands.html#method.reborrow) but it appears to still be referencing the temporary created by the call to `parent.spawn()` and so fails the same as the original version","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14883/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
