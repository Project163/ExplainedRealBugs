Objective\r\n\r\n- This PR adds a new stress test called `many_materials` to benchmark the rendering performance of many animated materials.\r\n- Fixes #11588 \r\n- This PR continues the work started in the previous PR #11592, which was closed due to inactivity.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Created a new example (`examples/stress_tests/many_materials.rs`) that renders a grid of cubes with animated materials.\r\n- The size of the grid can be configured using the `-n` command-line argument (or `--grid-size`). The default grid size is 10x10.\r\n- The materials animate by cycling through colors in the HSL color space.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- I have tested these changes locally on my Linux machine.\r\n- Reviewers can test the changes by running the example with different grid sizes and observing the performance (FPS, frame time).\r\n- I have not tested on other platforms (macOS, Windows, wasm), but I expect it to work as the code uses standard Bevy features.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Click to view
