Objective\r\nAddresses #21037\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nexplain how `ManualTextureViews` can be used.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI think the handles should be atomically increasing ids like other internal ids so that users don't have to pick a random offset into `u32` to avoid colliding with other `ManualTextureView`s (I'm not sure if there ever are multiple systems/libraries using this functionality in the same world, but it's not forbidden).\r\nA quick search through github shows most people just start at 0.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping these docs might make it into 0.17 though, so unless someone disagrees with me or that change would prevent some use-case I'm not aware of, I plan on creating a PR for that in in 0.18.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21087/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19759065279,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U87Lk8KdzwAAAASZu2i_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19759065279","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4f81cf84a4318fddbdb2a22912e876543f4d5c94","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/4f81cf84a4318fddbdb2a22912e876543f4d5c94","created_at":"2025-09-17T20:17:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3312573947","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21037#issuecomment-3312573947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21037","id":3312573947,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U87Fcd37","user":{"login":"FizzWizZleDazzle","id":126825095,"node_id":"U_kgDOB48yhw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/126825095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FizzWizZleDazzle","html_url":"https://github.com/FizzWizZleDazzle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FizzWizZleDazzle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FizzWizZleDazzle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FizzWizZleDazzle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FizzWizZleDazzle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FizzWizZleDazzle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FizzWizZleDazzle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FizzWizZleDazzle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FizzWizZleDazzle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FizzWizZleDazzle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-19T15:08:00Z","updated_at":"2025-09-19T15:08:00Z","body":"Thanks
