I'm stupid I was worried this was going to be terrible but I hadn't realised required components were transitive until now 😅 \n\nI think though that `Style` might be better a choice instead of `Node`

I've been thinking of a few constructions where it might be useful to have unstyled `Node`s. We might want to support alternative layout algorithms as well and it'd be easier if they could output `Node`s and use the existing UI extraction

Required components is meant to make it unnecessary to explicitly spawn essential nonconfigurable components but since it's relatively uncommon to spawn completely unstyled UI nodes VitalyAnkh's migration PR is full of code like:\n```rust\ncommands\n.spawn((\n    Node::default(),\n    Style {\n        width: Val::Percent(100.),\n        height: Val::Percent(100.),\n        ..default()\n    }\n))\n```\n\nwhich seems obviously wrong to me.

It isn't `Node` -> `Style`, it's `NodeBundle` to `Style` + required components. Bevy users are much more familiar with `Style` than `Node` which is normally only used internally. For the 0.16 transition `Style` gets removed and the fields are moved to `Node` which would just mean a change from:\n```\ncommands.spawn(\n    Style {\n        width: Val::Percent(100.),\n        height: Val::Percent(100.),\n        ..default()\n    }\n);\n```\nto\n```\ncommands.spawn(\n    Node {\n        width: Val::Percent(100.),\n        height: Val::Percent(100.),\n        ..default()\n    }\n);\n```\nI guess?
