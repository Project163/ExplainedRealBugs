bevy_input_focus\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a924255-0cd6-44a5-9bb7-b2c400a22d7e)\r\n\r\n## To do: this PR\r\n\r\n- [x] figure out why \"enter\" isn't doing anything\r\n- [x] change button color on interaction rather than printing\r\n- [x] add on-screen directions\r\n- [x] move to an asymmetric grid to catch bugs\r\n- [x] ~~fix colors not resetting on button press~~ lol this is mostly just a problem with hacking `Interaction` for this\r\n- [x] swap to using observers + bubbling, rather than `Interaction`\r\n\r\n## To do: future work\r\n\r\n- when I increase the button size, such that there is no line break, the text on the buttons is no longer centered :( EDIT: this is https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16783\r\n- add gamepad stick navigation\r\n- add tools to find the nearest populated quadrant to make diagonal inputs work\r\n- add a `add_edges` method to `DirectionalNavigationMap`\r\n- add a `add_grid` method to `DirectionalNavigationMap`\r\n- make the example's layout more complex and realistic\r\n- add tools to automatically generate this list\r\n- add button shake on failed navigation rather than printing an error\r\n- make Pressed events easier to mock: default fields, PointerId::Focus\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n`cargo run --example

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #16783\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nWorks around a `cosmic-text` bug or limitation by triggering a re-layout with the calculated width from the first layout run. See linked issue.\r\n\r\nCredit to @ickshonpe for the clever solution.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\nThis has a significant performance impact only on unbounded text that are not `JustifyText::Left`, which is still a bit of a bummer because text2d performance in 0.15.1 is already not great. But this seems better than alignment not working.\r\n\r\n||many_text2d nfc re|many_text2d nfc re center|\r\n|-|-|-|\r\n|unbounded-layout-no-fix|3.06|3.10|\r\n|unbounded-layout-fix|3.05 ⬜ -0.2%|2.71 🟥 -12.5%|\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI added a centered text to the `text2d` example.\r\n\r\n`cargo run --example text2d`\r\n\r\nWe should look at other text examples and stress tests.
