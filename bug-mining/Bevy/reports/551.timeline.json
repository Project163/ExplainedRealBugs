my project I want to disable the `bevy_sprite_picking_backend` feature and write my own (I want to fork #16388). However adding the following to my Cargo.toml does not work:\n\n```toml\nbevy = { version = \"0.15.0-rc.3\", default-features = false, features = [\n  # Default features\n  \"android-game-activity\",\n  \"android-game-activity\",\n  \"android_shared_stdcxx\",\n  \"animation\",\n  \"bevy_asset\",\n  \"bevy_audio\",\n  \"bevy_color\",\n  \"bevy_core_pipeline\",\n  \"bevy_gilrs\",\n  \"bevy_gizmos\",\n  \"bevy_gltf\",\n  # \"bevy_mesh_picking_backend\",\n  \"bevy_pbr\",\n  \"bevy_picking\",\n  \"bevy_remote\",\n  \"bevy_render\",\n  \"bevy_scene\",\n  \"bevy_sprite\",\n  # \"bevy_sprite_picking_backend\",\n  \"bevy_state\",\n  \"bevy_text\",\n  \"bevy_ui\",\n  # \"bevy_ui_picking_backend\",\n  \"bevy_winit\",\n  \"custom_cursor\",\n  \"default_font\",\n  \"hdr\",\n  \"multi_threaded\",\n  \"png\",\n  \"smaa_luts\",\n  \"sysinfo_plugin\",\n  \"tonemapping_luts\",\n  \"vorbis\",\n  \"webgl2\",\n  \"x11\",\n] }\n```\n\nMy PreUpdate graph still includes the sprite and ui backends. The mesh backend isn't present, but that's just because the `MeshPickingPlugin` is intentionally not added by default.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13fbe464-b99d-4388-ac03-875bb9e504b0)\n\nIt looks like the default features for `bevy_sprite` sets `bevy_sprite_picking_backend`. `bevy` then has a feature `bevy_sprite` that enables that crate which by default uses the picking backend. The `bevy_sprite_picking_backend` feature in `bevy` then does nothing since `bevy_sprite` itself sets this feature.\n\nA similar story exists for `bevy_ui_picking_backend` and `bevy_mesh_picking_backend`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15397067260,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86f3tIWzwAAAAOVvJn8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15397067260","actor":{"login":"BenjaminBrienen","id":42162869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTYyODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42162869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminBrienen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-22T12:48:33Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Triage","color":"D876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15397067267,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86f3tIWzwAAAAOVvJoD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15397067267","actor":{"login":"BenjaminBrienen","id":42162869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTYyODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42162869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminBrienen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-22T12:48:33Z","label":{"name":"S-Ready-For-Implementation","color":"D876E3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15397067275,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86f3tIWzwAAAAOVvJoL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15397067275","actor":{"login":"BenjaminBrienen","id":42162869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTYyODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42162869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminBrienen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-22T12:48:33Z","label":{"name":"D-Straightforward","color":"008672"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15397067281,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86f3tIWzwAAAAOVvJoR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15397067281","actor":{"login":"BenjaminBrienen","id":42162869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTYyODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42162869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminBrienen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/following{/other_user}","gists
