We intend to improve this with the addition of a panorbit camera, per #19741.\n\nHowever, neither of these are well-suited to 2D games, whether they are top-down or side-view. We should have a controller for these applications as well: allowing users to add a quick-and-dirty debug camera, and laying the foundation for support in the editor.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nAdd a simple RTS-style panning camera, probably called `PanCamera`. Control it with WASD, add QE rotation, zoom with mousewheel or +/-.\n\nLike the freecam, this should have its own module, feature flag and dedicated example.\n\nEdge panning should be omited: it's not very useful and can lead to frustrations when trying to manipulate objects at the edge of a deliberately chosen view or when moving the mouse off the viewport to access tools.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21468/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
