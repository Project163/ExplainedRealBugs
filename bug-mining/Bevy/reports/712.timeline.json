Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #18027 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nRun `redraw_requested` logic in `about_to_wait` on Windows during initial application startup and when in headless mode\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Ran `cargo run --example window_settings` to demonstrate invisible window creation worked again and fixes #18027\r\n- Ran `cargo run --example eased_motion` to demonstrate no regression with the fix for #17488 \r\n\r\nRan all additional `window` examples. \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- The `transparent_window` was not transparent but this appears to have been broken prior to #18004.

Bevy version\n\nCurrent `main` (8777dd414470284cd9653f94f405118f5576bf07).\n\n##  Relevant system information\n\nWindows 11\n\n## What you did\n\nRan a Bevy project and resized the window.\n\n\n## What went wrong\n\nWhile resizing the application window, the program freezes up completely and crashes.  This problem occurs on every run but may take repeated resizing before it shows up.  This is occurring in my application along with the basic Bevy 3d Scene example.\n\n## Additional information\n\nI bisected this and found the problem is introduced in 8122b35.\n\nIt seems like the issue is within `WinitAppRunnerState::about_to_wait()` where `self.redraw_requested(event_loop)` is always called for non-Windows platforms (where I assume the freezing does not occur), but there is unique, problematic logic for Windows that is causing `self.redraw_requested(event_loop)` to NOT be called enough.\n\nThe code causing this resize crash is also causing at least one related problem (and possibly others).  See #19030 and my related PR #19772 where there is a freeze occurring during drag-and-drop events—the PR fix just ensures that `self.redraw_requested(event_loop)` runs during a drag-and-drop event.\n\n\nThis issue (along with #19030) can be fixed with the following code changes.  That said, **I'm not familiar with the reasons for the current code, and this may cause other problems that the existing Windows-specific code was meant to fix.**\n\nOther related issues per code comments: #17488 and #18027.\n\n\n`bevy_winit/src/state.rs` lines 457-469\n - Just comment out the Windows block\n```rust\nWindowEvent::RedrawRequested => {\n    self.ran_update_since_last_redraw = false;\n\n    // // https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17488\n    // #[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\n    // {\n    //     // Have the startup behavior run in about_to_wait, which prevents issues with\n    //     // invisible window creation. https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18027\n    //     if self.startup_forced_updates == 0 {\n    //         manual_run_redraw_requested = true;\n    //     }\n    // }\n}\n```\n\n`bevy_winit/src/state.rs` lines 519-539\n- Comment out the Windows block and replace it with just calling `self.redraw_requested(event_loop)` like occurs on non-Windows platforms\n```rust\n// // Have the startup behavior run in about_to_wait, which prevents issues with\n// // invisible window creation. https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18027\n// #[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]\n// {\n//     WINIT_WINDOWS.with_borrow(|winit_windows| {\n//         let headless = winit_windows.windows.is_empty();\n//         let exiting = self.app_exit.is_some();\n//         let reactive = matches!(self.update_mode, UpdateMode::Reactive { .. });\n//         let all_invisible = winit_windows\n//             .windows\n//             .iter()\n//             .all(|(_, w)| !w.is_visible().unwrap_or(false));\n//         if !exiting\n//             && (self.startup_forced_updates > 0 || headless || all_invisible || reactive)\n//         {\n//             self.redraw_requested(event_loop);\n//         }\n//     });\n// }\nself.redraw_requested(event_loop);\n```\n\n\n# Example of Crash\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aef8397b-3f10-4fc1-82c4-37a029d6a5b8\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20141/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20141/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
