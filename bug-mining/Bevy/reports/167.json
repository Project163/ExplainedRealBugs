I'll go with rect3d for this post since it is the most intuitive to me.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no primitive buildin to express a rect in 3d space.\r\nThere are however usecases, such as:\r\n* Using the rect3d to for raycasting/collision detection (imagine looking through a portal)\r\n* Using the rect3d to describe a surface, such as a water surface\r\n* Using the rect3d to create meshes.\r\n\r\nThe current alternative would be the [`Plane3d`](https://docs.rs/bevy/0.13.0/bevy/math/prelude/struct.Plane3d.html) which is describes a unbounded plane. Not quite what we need her but close.\r\nI also believe that separating the abstraction of a infinite and finite plane is necessary to avoid confusion and unwanted sideeffects down the line. \r\nThis topic has already been raised by @alice-i-cecile in this issue https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12243\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\nA struct `Rect3d` \r\nimplementing `Meshable` and being a Bounding volume\r\n\r\nThe actual name of the struct is open to debate\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12388/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12388/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
