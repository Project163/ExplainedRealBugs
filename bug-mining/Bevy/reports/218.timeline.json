@cart. I know you pushed back on this in #3893 in the past.\r\n\r\n> This is the result of a reasonable amount of design thinking. It is currently our best (and only) solution to the problem that doesn't require massive internal reworks and/or compromised UX. We are still free to design new things and I don't think keeping this in meaningfully limits that conversation. And I doubt we will see anything better that doesn't:\r\n\r\nI think the landscape has meaningfully changed here on the editor side, between the existence of `dextrous_developer` and @coreh's remote protocol experiments. That said, I still don't have a good answer to the DLC use case you mentioned:\r\n\r\n> I would argue that this is helpful, for the exact scenario mentioned above (loading features compiled separately from each other at the start up of a pre-compiled app). That isn't particularly niche. In addition to making editor experiences better for minimal additional effort, this would also enable things like \"loading a dlc downloaded from the internet / distributed separately from the main game\". I consider that to be very attractive and very helpful.\r\n\r\nOverall while I share these concerns I'd be fine to leave this around until we have a good sense of the architecture of the editor, and how editor extensions in particular will work.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1951547386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11842879197,"node_id":"MEE_lADODf6-U85_oX9yzwAAAALB4_7d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11842879197","actor":{"login":"coreh","id":418473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/418473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh","html_url":"https://github.com/coreh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-19T01:35:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11842879206,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U85_oX9yzwAAAALB4_7m","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11842879206","actor":{"login":"coreh","id":418473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/418473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh","html_url":"https://github.com/coreh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coreh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-19T01:35:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11842879219,"node_id":"MEE_lADODf6-U85_oX9yzwAAAALB4_7z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11842879219","actor":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2694663?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart","html_url":"https://github.com/cart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-19T01:35:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11842879229,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U85_oX9yzwAAAALB4_79","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11842879229","actor":{"login":"cart","id":2694663,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTQ2N

should note that I am biased here - as the maintainer of `dexterous_developer` - but I think the current version of this crate is worth revoking.\r\n\r\nI also think that the solutions for dynamic loading in a development context should be different than the ones used for things like DLC and mods - the constraints around them are very different:\r\n\r\n- During development, things like rust version, nightly, and features are unlikely to change. And if they do - rebuild and you're good! So having some amount of instability there is more acceptable. In a released project, you really want a solid ABI for dynamic libraries, or to use IPC.\r\n- In addition, in development you might be OK with using some less optimized/performant build processes - which could open up some additional avenues. In a released project, those optimizations (whether around size or performance) become much more important.\r\n- Lastly, for development, the priority is being able to \"hot-reload\" a library for fast iteration. In a released project, you would often be turning these features on and off in a menu or even through a loader, and so they don't need to have the same state retention capacity - and might be able to handle full restarts.\r\n\r\nI do think it might be worth looking at adding [stabby](https://docs.rs/stabby/latest/stabby/) to Bevy as an optional feature for ABI stability, and then we can use that as a basis for both the bevy plugin in dexterous developer (or for integrating that plugin into bevy) and for a separate approach for handling release-capable dynamic libraries for mods and DLC.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1951561500/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lee-orr","id":10376144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzc2MTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10376144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-orr","html_url":"https://github.com/lee-orr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-orr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-orr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-orr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-orr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-orr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-orr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-orr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-orr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lee-orr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1957665553","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11969#issuecomment-1957665553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11969","id":1957665553,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U850r5sR","user":{"login":"BD103","id":59022059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDIyMDU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59022059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103","html_url":"https://github.com/BD103","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BD103/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-21T18:37:51Z","updated_at":"2024-02-21T18:37:51Z","body":"I just opened #12029.

Bevy version\r\n\r\n0.13.2\r\n\r\n## \\[Optional\\] Relevant system information\r\nOS: Windows 11 Pro for Workstations - 23H2 - 22631.3447\r\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 4800H with Radeon Graphics 2.90 GHz\r\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650Ti for Laptop\r\nRAM: 64GB\r\nRust Version: rustc 1.77.2 (25ef9e3d8 2024-04-09)\r\nCargo Version: cargo 1.77.2 (e52e36006 2024-03-26)\r\n\r\n## What you did\r\n\r\nI am tring to test whether Bevy can share component type throuth different dynamic plugins(i.e. System in one dylib can detect component spawned by System in another dylib).\r\nSo I create three crates inside the main project. One defines Components, Others depend this static lib and run Systems. In main.rs of this project, I enable bevy's \"bevy_dynamic_plugin\" feature then invoke load_plugin()\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\nWhether test success or fail, dynamic_plugin should built successfully, but I encountered `Exception: Exception 0xc0000005 encountered at address 0x000000: User-mode data execution prevention (DEP) violation at location 0x00000000` and then bevy crashed.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nI debug the application several times. I'm sure that dlls are successfully loaded.\r\nThe last step before exception is as follows:\r\n![a9b4a057e0373f86602bab2a9a00ff3e](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/24354434/41765e2a-38d4-425e-84d7-835386b9ea8a)\r\nthen, it crashes:\r\n![afcc0b6bf2ef46794b42fc215e007d81](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/24354434/76c2c35b-5b76-454c-8a75-9c12749e5463)\r\nThe top of trace stack is:\r\n![725f8d3a50268044c9ed7cc6876356af](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/24354434/8c114ccb-6119-4642-a2c0-29df1c799d6a)\r\n\r\nIt appears that the address of `self` is 0x0 or 0x4 or many other address nearby 0x0, but actually `self` has its own address. What happend when app calls `plugin.build(self)`?\r\nI switched lib type to cdylib, but it makes nonsense.\r\nThe content of dll is quite simple(This problem exists whether these lines are commented or not ):\r\n```rust\r\nuse bevy::app::DynamicPlugin;\r\nuse bevy::prelude::{App, Commands, Component, Plugin, Query, Startup, Update};\r\nuse xk_python::Test1;\r\n\r\n#[derive(DynamicPlugin)]\r\npub struct XkUiplugin;\r\n\r\nimpl Plugin for XkUiplugin {\r\n    fn build(&self, app: &mut App) {\r\n        // println!(\"build ui\");\r\n        // app.add_systems(Update, test_ui);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nsame to main.rs\r\n```rust\r\npub mod prelude;\r\n\r\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\r\nuse std::env;\r\n\r\npub fn main() {\r\n    unsafe {\r\n        println!(\"{}\", String::from(env::current_dir().unwrap().to_str().unwrap()) + \"\\\\xk_ui.dll\");\r\n        App::new()\r\n            .load_plugin( \"D:\\\\WorkSpace\\\\Project\\\\FormalProject\\\\XKGIS\\\\XKGIS-Core\\\\target\\\\debug\\\\xk_ui.dll\")\r\n            .load_plugin(\"D:\\\\WorkSpace\\\\Project\\\\FormalProject\\\\XKGIS\\\\XKGIS-Core\\\\target\\\\debug\\\\xk_show_screen.dll\")\r\n            .add_plugins(MinimalPlugins)\r\n            .run();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nMy friend helped me checked dll content with IDA, he says the dll files I used are completely normal.\r\nDebugger of RustRover gives me assembly code, I don't know whether it can help.\r\n```asm\r\nbevy_dynamic_plugin::loader::impl$0::load_plugin<ref$<str$> >(*mut bevy_app::app::App,ref$<str$>):\r\n\tpushq  %rbp                     \r\n\tsubq   $0xe0, %rsp              \r\n\tleaq   0x80(%rsp), %rbp         \r\n\tmovq   $-0x2, 0x58(%rbp)        \r\n\tmovq   %rcx, -0x50(%rbp)        \r\n\tmovq   %rcx, 0x18(%rbp)         \r\n\tmovq   %rdx, 0x20(%rbp)         \r\n\tmovq   %r8, 0x28(%rbp)          \r\n\tmovb   $0x0, 0x17(%rbp)         \r\n\tleaq   -0x18(%rbp), %rcx        \r\n\tcallq  0x140002cb0                ;

Objective\r\n\r\n- The current implementation for dynamic plugins is unsound. Please see #11969 for background and justification.\r\n- Closes #11969 and closes #13073 and closes #4843.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Deprecate all dynamic plugin items for Bevy 0.14, with plans to remove them for Bevy 0.15.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nOne thing I want to make clear is that I'm not opposed to dynamic plugins _in general_. I think they can be handy, especially for DLC and modding, but I think the current system is the wrong approach. It's too much of a footgun for the meager benefit is provides.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Deprecated the current dynamic plugin system.\r\n  - Dynamic plugins will be removed in Bevy 0.15. For now you can continue using them by marking your code with `#[allow(deprecated)]`.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nIf possible, remove all usage of dynamic plugins.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Old\r\n#[derive(DynamicPlugin)]\r\npub struct MyPlugin;\r\n\r\nApp::new()\r\n    .load_plugin(\"path/to/plugin\")\r\n    .run();\r\n\r\n// New\r\npub struct MyPlugin;\r\n\r\nApp::new()\r\n    .add_plugins(MyPlugin)\r\n    .run();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to do that, you may temporarily silence the deprecation warnings.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[allow(deprecated)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that the current dynamic plugin system will be removed by the next major Bevy release, so you will have to migrate eventually.
