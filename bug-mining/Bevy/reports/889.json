For most situations, this doesn't matter. As per #19887, our goal is to migrate ~all of our resource inits to `RenderStartup`. However, in some situations, render resources are needed to extract data from the main world.\n\nFor a concrete case, there is `LightmapPlugin`. When extracting `Lightmap` components from the main world, it tries to allocate lightmap \"slabs\". Based on whether \"bindless\" is supported by the renderer, this determines how many lightmaps we can have per slab.\n\nWhile this particular case has a few potential solutions, the broader concern is that `RenderStartup` running after `ExtractSchedule` leads to this surprising behavior.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19910/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19910/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
