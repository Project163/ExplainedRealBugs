Bevy version\n\nBevy 0.15.0-rc.3\n\n## What you did\n\nI have a component, let's say `A`, that requires another component `B` using `#[require(B)]`. `B` then requires another component `C`, but the requirement is registered in a plugin using `app.register_required_components::<B, C>()`.\n\n## What went wrong\n\nWhen I spawn an entity with `A`, `C` is not added!\n\nHere's a simple test that fails:\n\n```rust\n#[test]\nfn runtime_required_components() {\n    // `A` requires `B` directly.\n    #[derive(Component)]\n    #[require(B)]\n    struct A;\n\n    #[derive(Component, Default)]\n    struct B;\n\n    #[derive(Component, Default)]\n    struct C;\n\n    let mut world = World::new();\n\n    // `B` requires `C` with runtime registration.\n    // This *fails*, but not when using `#[require(C)]` for `B`.\n    world.register_required_components::<B, C>();\n\n    // Adding runtime registration for `A -> B` also doesn't help if done after `B -> C`,\n    // but it *does* work if done before.\n    let _ = world.try_register_required_components::<A, B>();\n\n    let entity = world.spawn(A).id();\n    assert!(world.entity(entity).get::<C>().is_some());\n}\n```\n\nIf the entity is spawned with `B` directly, it *does* work:\n\n```rust\n#[test]\nfn runtime_required_components_2() {\n    #[derive(Component)]\n    #[require(B)]\n    struct A;\n\n    #[derive(Component, Default)]\n    struct B;\n\n    #[derive(Component, Default)]\n    struct C;\n\n    let mut world = World::new();\n\n    world.register_required_components::<B, C>();\n\n    let _ = world.try_register_required_components::<A, B>();\n\n    let id = world.spawn(B).id();\n    assert!(world.entity(id).get::<C>().is_some());\n}\n```\n\nThis implies that the problem is related to runtime requirements not being properly propagated up the inheritance tree if the higher levels use `#[require(...)]`, or if the higher level requirement is added after the lower level requirement.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16406/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
