It should almost never be called by end users as they're called internally when setting up queries.\r\n\r\n`App::init_resource` initializes a resource with default values in the world, and is a common API.\r\n\r\nThis false parallel is confusing!\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nRename `init_component` and `init_component_with_desciptor` to be called `register_*`, wherever they are defined (both App and World have methods at least).\r\n\r\nConsider improving the docs for these methods while you're there, but you don't have to.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nWe could call these `initalize_component`, but that's still unclear and confusing. We could instead call these `get_component_id`, but that's also a bit misleading: these methods do actually initialize things and need to be called even if the result is discarded.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\n#15448 recommends adding another parallel method for resources. This should be renamed as well.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15451/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15451/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
