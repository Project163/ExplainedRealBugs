a `HeadlessPlugins` plugin group, that adds more default functionality (like logging) than the `MinimumPlugins`. Fixes #15203\r\nChanged the headless example to use the new plugin group.\r\n\r\nI am not entirely sure if the list of plugins is correct. Are there ones that should be added / removed?\r\n\r\n----\r\nThe `TerminalCtrlCHandlerPlugin` has interesting effects in the headless example: Installing it a second time it will give a log message about skipping installation, because it is already installed. Ctrl+C will terminate the application in that case. However, _not_ installing it the second time (so only on the app that runs once) has the effect that the app that runs continuously cannot be stopped using Ctrl+C.\r\nThis implies that, even though the second app did not install the Ctrl+C handler, it did _something_ because it was keeping the one from the first app alive.\r\nNot sure if this is a problem or issue, or can be labeled a wierd quirk of having multiple Apps in one executable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15260/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15260/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14289221196,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86WmRHQzwAAAANTtDZM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14289221196","actor":{"login":"Wcubed","id":7442115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NDIxMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7442115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wcubed","html_url":"https://github.com/Wcubed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wcubed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wcubed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wcubed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wcubed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wcubed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wcubed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wcubed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wcubed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wcubed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"49e6b0fc9d34a97dfbe22a4807f8e47c38265ffa","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Wcubed/bevy/commits/49e6b0fc9d34a97dfbe22a4807f8e47c38265ffa","created_at":"2024-09-17T10:46:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14327731313,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86WmRHQzwAAAANV_9Rx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14327731313","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"55c84cc7226aac4fab3310b8e8281167f5c7c03b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/55c84cc7226aac4fab3310b8e8281167f5c7c03b","created_at":"2024-09-19T17:00:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14327731503,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86WmRHQzwAAAANV_9Uv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14327731503","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-19T17:00:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
