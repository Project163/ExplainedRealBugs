Objective\r\n\r\n- Currently adding observers spawns an entity which implicitly flushes the command queue, which can cause undefined behaviour if the `WorldEntityMut` is used after this\r\n- The reason `WorldEntityMut` attempted to (unsuccessfully) avoid flushing commands until finished was that such commands may move or despawn the entity being referenced, invalidating the cached location.\r\n- With the introduction of hooks and observers, this isn't sensible anymore as running the commands generated by hooks immediately is required to maintain correct ordering of operations and to not expose the world in an inconsistent state\r\n- Objective is to make command flushing deterministic and fix the related issues\r\n- Fixes #16212\r\n- Fixes #14621 \r\n- Fixes #16034\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Allow `WorldEntityMut` to exist even when it refers to a despawned entity by allowing `EntityLocation` to be marked invalid\r\n- Add checks to all methods to panic if trying to access a despawned entity\r\n- Flush command queue after every operation that might trigger hooks or observers\r\n- Update entity location always after flushing command queue\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Added test cases for currently broken behaviour\r\n- Added test cases that flushes happen in all operations\r\n- Added test cases to ensure hooks and commands are run exactly in correct order when nested\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n\r\n- [x] Write migration guide\r\n- [x] Add tests that using `EntityWorldMut` on a despawned entity panics\r\n- [x] Add tests that commands are flushed after every operation that is supposed to flush them\r\n- [x] Add tests that hooks, observers and their spawned commands are run in the correct order when nested\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nPreviously `EntityWorldMut` triggered command queue flushes in unpredictable places, which could interfere with hooks and observers. Now the command queue is flushed always immediately after any call in `EntityWorldMut` that spawns or despawns an entity, or adds, removes or replaces a component. This means hooks and observers will run their commands in the correct order.\r\n\r\nAs a side effect, there is a possibility that a hook or observer could despawn the entity that is being referred to by `EntityWorldMut`. This could already currently happen if an observer was added while keeping an `EntityWorldMut` referece and would cause unsound behaviour. If the entity has been despawned, calling any methods which require the entity location will panic. This matches the behaviour that `Commands` will panic if called on an already despawned entity. In the extremely rare case where taking a new `EntityWorldMut` reference or otherwise restructuring the code so that this case does not happen is not possible, there's a new `is_despawned` method that can be used to check if the referred entity has been despawned.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16219/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15550049407,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86czWeZzwAAAAOe2ux_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15550049407","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"76d610d465db9ec99cfcae33a18e23b78da6f8db","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/76d610d465db9ec99cfcae33a18e23b78da6f8db","created_at":"2024-12-05T20:47:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15550049583,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86czWeZzwAAAAOe2u0v","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15550049583","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-05T20:47:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15830458095,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86czWeZzwAAAAOvkZ7v","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15830458095","actor":{"login":"ecoskey","id":56370779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MzcwNzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56370779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey","html_url":"https://github.com/ecoskey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8e911a2d50e73a1a5b6e5873b290c0eaeecff476","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ecoskey/bevy/commits/8e911a2d50e73a1a5b6e5873b290c0eaeecff476","created_at":"2025-01-06T20:11:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
