Objective\r\n\r\n- When writing \"in game\" debugging tools, quite often you need the name of an entity (for example an entity tree). DebugName is the usual way of doing that.\r\n- A recent change to Entity's Debug implementation meant it was no longer a minimal {index}v{generation} but instead a more verbose auto generated Debug.\r\n- This made DebugName's Debug implementation also verbose\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- I changed DebugName to derive Debug automatically and added a new (preferred) Display implementation for it which is the preferred name for an entity. If the entity has a Name component its the contents of that, otherwise it is {index}v{generation} (though this does not use Display of the Entity as that is more verbose than this).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- I've added a new test in name.rs which tests the Display implementation for DebugName by using to_string.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- In code which uses DebugName you should now use the Display implementation rather than the Debug implementation (ie {} instead of {:?} if you were printing it out).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2184166484","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13980#issuecomment-2184166484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13980","id":2184166484,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86CL7xU","user":{"login":"eidloi","id":20684057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjg0MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20684057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi","html_url":"https://github.com/eidloi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-22T19:40:10Z","updated_at":"2024-06-22T19:40:10Z","body":"> Would you be okay with a `short_id` method?

The number after the pipe is also generally useless for most use cases, unless you specifically need to track that number. \r\n\r\nBut now that you have suggested, it does make sense to have a version that is like the current `Display` with the number after it as a function.

Objective\r\n\r\n#12469 changed the `Debug` impl for `Entity`, making sure it's actually accurate for debugging. To ensure that its can still be readily logged in error messages and inspectors, this PR added a more concise and human-friendly `Display` impl.\r\n\r\nHowever, users found this form too verbose: the `to_bits` information was unhelpful and too long. Fixes #13980. \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Don't include `Entity::to_bits` in the `Display` implementation for `Entity`. This information can readily be accessed and logged for users who need it.\r\n- Also clean up the implementation of `Display` for `DebugName`, introduced in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/13760, to simply use the new `Display` impl (since this was the desired format there).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI've updated an existing test to verify the output of `Entity::display`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14011/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13285193610,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86NJKTjzwAAAAMX2_eK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13285193610","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-25T17:23:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13285264893,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86NJKTjzwAAAAMX3Q39","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13285264893","actor":{"login":"Luracasmus","id":77991691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3OTkxNjkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77991691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luracasmus","html_url":"https://github.com/Luracasmus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luracasmus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luracasmus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luracasmus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luracasmus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luracasmus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luracasmus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luracasmus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luracasmus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luracasmus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"52e5ad5da7b59b2771cdec7b3637caa8a5c8a97e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Luracasmus/bevy/commits/52e5ad5da7b59b2771cdec7b3637caa8a5c8a97e","created_at":"2024-06-25T17:28:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13288514427,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86NJKTjzwAAAAMYDqN7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13288514427","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9eb547ec1ff5d44643266f2bbc7d872255458c26","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/9eb547ec1ff5d44643266f2bbc7d872255458c26","created_at":"2024-06-25T22:16:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
