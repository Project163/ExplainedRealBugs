For example, here is what it says about [Cuboid](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/prelude/struct.Cuboid.html):\r\n> A cuboid primitive, more commonly known as a box.\r\n\r\nOkay, neat. Well, that leaves a lot to be desired, especially in light of the fact that a `Cuboid` is not just something that exists in the ether: it has representations through meshes, gizmos, and random sampling. In fact, all of those use the same shared understanding of how this cuboid is actually situated in space: it is a rectangular prism centered at the origin, with its sides aligned to the standard coordinate axes. \r\n\r\nThis is true for basically all of our mathematical primitives: there's basically always a more precise shared understanding of what the values of the primitive actually represent. If I were to codify it, it would be something like this: geometric primitive types parametrize all primitives of one particular shape situated in one particular way in space. \r\n\r\nFor example, `Sphere`, which currently says\r\n> A sphere primitive\r\n\r\nis perhaps more honestly described as the type consisting of all spheres centered at the origin. This is how it appears in mesh coordinates, in gizmos, and in random sampling. \r\n\r\nI understand that there may have been some good intentions that led to the current state of affairs: after all, more precise descriptions like the ones I've given may invite some unwarranted assumptions. As such, I think solving this is kind of a delicate matter, since I'd like for these descriptions to both convey that the data encoded in the type *essentially* just encodes all primitives of one particular shape, while still documenting how they are assumed to be situated in space for geometric purposes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps something like this would suffice:\r\n> A sphere of some given radius.\r\n>\r\n> With its default positioning, it is situated at the origin.\r\n\r\nAnd then for something like `Capsule3d`:\r\n> A capsule primitive consisting of a cylinder capped by spherical domes at each end. Its surface consists of all points lying at some fixed distance from a line segment.\r\n>\r\n> With its default positioning, it is situated at the origin with its cylindrical part extending along the Y-axis.\r\n\r\nIt's probably possible to do better than this, since I just came up with these on the spot.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13725/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13725/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
