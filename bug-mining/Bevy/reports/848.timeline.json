Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #19219 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nInstead of calling `world.commands().trigger` and `world.commands().trigger_targets` whenever each scene is spawned, save the `instance_id` and optional parent entity to perform all such calls at the end. This prevents the potential flush of the world command queue that can happen if `add_child` is called from causing the crash.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Did you test these changes? If so, how?\r\n  - Verified that I can no longer reproduce the bug with the instructions at #19219.\r\n  - Ran `bevy_scene` tests\r\n  - Visually verified that the following examples still run as expected `many_foxes`, `scene` . (should I test any more?)\r\n- Are there any parts that need more testing?\r\n  - Pending to run `cargo test` at the root to test that all examples still build; I will update the PR when that's done\r\n- How can other people (reviewers) test your changes? Is there anything specific they need to know?\r\n  - Run bevy as usual\r\n- If relevant, what platforms did you test these changes on, and are there any important ones you can't test?\r\n  - N/a (tested on Linux/wayland but it shouldn't be relevant)\r\n\r\n---","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17685151046,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U8621FLIzwAAAAQeHf1G","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17685151046","actor":{"login":"greeble-dev","id":166992735,"node_id":"U_kgDOCfQbXw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166992735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/greeble-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-16T08:43:38Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Triage","color":"D876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17685151062,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U8621FLIzwAAAAQeHf1W","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17685151062","actor":{"login":"greeble-dev","id":166992735,"node_id":"U_kgDOCfQbXw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166992735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/greeble-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-16T08:43:38Z","label":{"name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17685151072,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U8621FLIzwAAAAQeHf1g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17685151072","actor":{"login":"greeble-dev","id":166992735,"node_id":"U_kgDOCfQbXw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166992735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/greeble-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-16T08:43:38Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Review","color":"D876E3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17685276086,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U8621FLIzwAAAAQeH-W2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17685276086","actor":{"login":"greeble-dev","id":166992735,"node_id":"U_kgDOCfQbXw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166992735?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/greeble-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greeble-dev/subscriptions","orga

am attempting to customize BSP loading by adding more physics components on brushes which have `Collider`s generated.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis of trying to perform a task, where I eventually found a solution, which may help others coming along, but I wonder if there's a better way.\n\nThe first attempt seemed like it would be straightforward:\n```\n#[solid_class(\n\thooks(SpawnHooks::new().convex_collider().push(Self::add_sensors())),\n)]\nstruct FuncMyClass;\nimpl FuncMyClass {\n   fn add_sensors(view: &mut QuakeClassSpawnView) {\n     view.world.entity_mut(view.entity).insert((\n\t(\n\t\tSensor,\n\t\tCollisionEventsEnabled,\n\t)\n     ))\n  }\n}\n```\n\n(Of course, using `#[require]` would be even shorter....)\n\nBut I found that using this approach, my new components are inserted on the *parent* of the child entity that is created to contain the `Collider`, so these components aren't effective (using Avian and Bevy 0.16.1, btw).\n\nSo I attempted to convert the logic to post-process the scene after loading, as in:\n\n```\n    commands.spawn(\n        SceneRoot(asset_server.load(bsp_path))\n    )\n\t.observe(|\n\t\ttrigger: Trigger<SceneInstanceReady>,\n\t\tmut commands: Commands,\n\t\tclass_q: Query<&FuncMyClass>,\n                collider_q: Query<&Collider>,\n\t| {\n\t\tlet collider_bundle = (\n\t\t\tSensor,\n\t\t\tCollisionEventsEnabled,\n\t\t);\n\n\t\tfor entity in child_q.iter_descendants(trigger.target()) {\n\t\t\tif class_q.contains(entity) {\n\t\t\t\tfor child_ent in child_q.iter_descendants(entity) {\n\t\t\t\t\tif collider_q.contains(child_ent) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommands.entity(child_ent).insert(collider_bundle.clone());\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t});\n```\n\nBut this doesn't work either: there are no `Collider`s at this point (apparently th `Collider`s are added some time after `SceneInstanceReady`).\n\nSo the solution that finally worked for me is to find the `Mesh3d` in the child(ren):\n\n```\n    commands.spawn(\n        SceneRoot(asset_server.load(bsp_path))\n    )\n\t.observe(|\n\t\ttrigger: Trigger<SceneInstanceReady>,\n\t\tmut commands: Commands,\n\t\tclass_q: Query<&FuncMyClass>,\n                mesh_q: Query<&Mesh3d>,\n\t| {\n\t\tlet collider_bundle = (\n\t\t\tSensor,\n\t\t\tCollisionEventsEnabled,\n\t\t);\n\n\t\tfor entity in child_q.iter_descendants(trigger.target()) {\n\t\t\tif class_q.contains(entity) {\n\t\t\t\tfor child_ent in child_q.iter_descendants(entity) {\n\t\t\t\t\tif mesh_q.contains(child_ent) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcommands.entity(child_ent).insert(collider_bundle.clone());\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t// ... other classes and observers and such\n\t\t}\n\t});\n```\n\n(Also, this only works for visible brushes. For invisible sensor brushes, I needed to make an indexed `{blank` texture of all pixel = 255 to both convince qbsp to retain the faces and for bevy_trenchbroom to generate a child Mesh3d I could collide with.)\n\nIs there a better way to do this that I'm not finding? This works, but feels a bit too much boilerplate (and I have to add logic for all the classes in one place, or have multiple passes through the scene), not to mention it adds a dependency on how this crate creates the entity tree. \n\nAll this said, it's still quite a pleasurable experience using this crate! Everything else seems to just work.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Noxmore/bevy_trenchbroom/issues/126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Noxmore/bevy_trenchbroom/issues/126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
