These methods have no error-returning variants, and there is currently no way to check from the outside if a `PluginGroupBuilder` has a given plugin, even though internally it would just be a simple `contains_key` call to the plugin hash map.\n\nThis can be problematic for APIs that take or produce a `PluginGroupBuilder` and want to perform some operations on it, or otherwise just need to check if a plugin exists.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nAdd a `contains` or `has` method to `PluginGroupBuilder`.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\n- Add non-panicking variants for all of the panicking methods (not exclusive with a `contains` method, both could exist)\n- Make the panicking methods non-panicking (doesn't necessarily solve just wanting to know if a plugin exists)\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17001/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17001/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
