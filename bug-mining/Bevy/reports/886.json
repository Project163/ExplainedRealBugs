However, this sprite steals all picking interactions --- mouse press no longer registers on the other sprite.\n\nIf you change the size of the first sprite to (0.01, 0.01) instead, then things work as expected even without any visible pixels from the tiny sprite.\n\nWhile uncommon, I ran into this issue while making my sprite size determined by some value that starts at zero, e.g.:\n\n```rust\npub fn sprite_size(sprites: Query<&mut Sprite>, my_val: Res<MyVal>) {\n    for mut sprite in sprites {\n        sprite.custom_size = Some(Vec2::new(my_val.0, my_val.0));\n    }\n}\n```\nThis was surprising behaviour that took some debugging to resolve.","closed_by":{"login":"AtheMathmo","id":10150986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTUwOTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10150986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo","html_url":"https://github.com/AtheMathmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AtheMathmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19880/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
