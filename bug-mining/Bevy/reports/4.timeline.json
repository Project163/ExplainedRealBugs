always, but skip it if the new length is smaller.\r\n\r\nFor context, `path_cache` is a `Vec<Vec<Option<Entity>>>`.\r\n\r\n# Objective\r\n\r\nPreviously, when setting a new length to the `path_cache`, we would:\r\n\r\n1. Deallocate all existing `Vec<Option<Entity>>`\r\n2. Deallocate the `path_cache`\r\n3. Allocate a new `Vec<Vec<Option<Entity>>>`, where each item is an empty `Vec`, and would have to be allocated when pushed to.\r\n\r\nThis is a lot of allocations!\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nUse [`Vec::resize_with`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.resize_with).\r\n\r\nWith this change, what occurs is:\r\n\r\n1. We `clear` each `Vec<Option<Entity>>`, keeping the allocation, but making the memory of each `Vec` re-usable\r\n2. We only append new `Vec` to `path_cache` when it is too small.\r\n\r\n* Fixes #11328 \r\n\r\n### Note on performance\r\n\r\nI didn't benchmark it, I just ran a diff on the generated assembly (ran with `--profile stress-test` and `--native`). I found this PR has 20 less instructions in `apply_animation` (out of 2504).\r\n\r\nThough on a purely abstract level, I can deduce this leads to less allocation.\r\n\r\nMore information on profiling allocations in rust: https://nnethercote.github.io/perf-book/heap-allocations.html\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n\r\nI think a [jagged vec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_array) would be much more pertinent. Because it allocates everything in a single contiguous buffer.\r\n\r\nThis would avoid dancing around allocations, and reduces the overhead of one `*mut T` and two `usize` per row, also removes indirection, improving cache efficiency. I think it would both improve code quality and performance.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11330/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11478744740,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U857_tm5zwAAAAKsL76k","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11478744740","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"78b5f323f87500bfd20eb5eb45a599d06324ba7b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/78b5f323f87500bfd20eb5eb45a599d06324ba7b","created_at":"2024-01-13T19:46:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11478744770,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U857_tm5zwAAAAKsL77C","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11478744770","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-13T19:46:34Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
