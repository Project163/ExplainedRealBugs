To achieve this it is no longer a `ReflectKind::Value` but rather a `ReflectKind::Enum` and as such carries these changes with it:\r\n\r\nFor `Result<T, E>`\r\n- Both `T` and `E` no longer require to be `Clone` and now require to be `FromReflect`\r\n- `<Result<T, E> as Reflect>::reflect_*` now returns a `ReflectKind::Enum`, so any code that previously relied on it being a `Value` kind will have to be adapted.\r\n- `Result<T, E>` now implements `Enum`\r\n\r\nSince the migration is highly dependent on the previous usage, no automatic upgrade path can be given.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2090658658","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13178#issuecomment-2090658658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13178","id":2090658658,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U858nOti","user":{"login":"TheNeikos","id":1631166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzExNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1631166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos","html_url":"https://github.com/TheNeikos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-02T14:37:14Z","updated_at":"2024-05-02T14:37:14Z","body":"I
