When adding the tower-placement systems, I was placing lots of `Cylinder`s on a plane. \n\n## What went wrong\n\nExpected:\nI expected to see lots and lots of cylinders, maybe seeing the FPS drop as the number gets very large\n\nActual:\nAfter a few 10s or 100s of cylinders, the geometry \"turns inside out\"  (see videos)\n\n## Additional information\n- I'm very new to Bevy, I could be using some bad memory-access pattern, and only getting lucky with ordering/optimization on older commits.\n- No errors or warning in logs\n- Maybe something to do with memory getting stomped?\n- Occurs in both release and debug build profiles\n\n## Videos\n###  Bad\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cfbab52-6eee-4aa9-b142-197122691ddf\n\n### Good\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fc9d181-a375-4124-80ea-3f71e0fe674f","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17766/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17766/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
