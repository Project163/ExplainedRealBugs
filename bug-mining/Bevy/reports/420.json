If a Res<Foo> doesn't exist the system just doesn't run. Similar to how iterating over a Query<Bar> that matches nothing loops over nothing. If users want a more explicit panicky behavior they can use Option<Res<Foo>> & unwrap.\r\n\r\nI do think we should do this, and if we can get this behavior in place I'd prefer to encourage the use of the `Single` system param from #15264. This would go a long way to addressing the problem and ensuring non-panicking behavior by default without an ergonomics hit.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @iiYese and @alice-i-cecile in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14275#issuecomment-2356344841_\r\n            ","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15265/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15265/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
