Further, there is no system set (like most other bevy internals have) to allow users to order their systems before/after BRP.\n\nGiven that the whole point of BRP is to allow monitoring and messing with ECS data, the impact of this is quite severe. As is, BRP always runs with ambiguous/undefined/racy ordering with respect to all user systems in `Update`. Every frame, it may or may not see changes to component values made by various user systems.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nHonestly, BRP should probably not be in `Update` in the first place.\n\nRegardless of which schedule it runs in, there should be a system set, to allow people to order systems around it.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nThere aren't any afaik?\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16042/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16042/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
