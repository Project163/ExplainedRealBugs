Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #11479\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Remove `collide_aabb.rs`\r\n- Re-implement the example-specific collision code in the example, taking advantage of the new `IntersectsVolume` trait.\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Removed `sprite::collide_aabb::collide` and `sprite::collide_aabb::Collision`.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n`sprite::collide_aabb::collide` and `sprite::collide_aabb::Collision` were removed.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Before\r\nlet collision = bevy::sprite::collide_aabb::collide(a_pos, a_size, b_pos, b_size);\r\nif collision.is_some() {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// After\r\nlet collision = Aabb2d::new(a_pos.truncate(), a_size / 2.)\r\n    .intersects(&Aabb2d::new(b_pos.truncate(), b_size / 2.));\r\nif collision {\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you were making use `collide_aabb::Collision`, see the new `collide_with_side` function in the [`breakout` example](https://bevyengine.org/examples/Games/breakout/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nAs discussed in the linked issue, maybe we want to wait on `bevy_sprite` generally making use of `Aabb2b` so users don't need to construct it manually. But since they **do** need to construct the bounding circle for the ball manually, this doesn't seem like a big deal to me.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11631483016,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U85819CqzwAAAAK1SliI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11631483016","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1bc293f33ab42628e74fb7d054e3b07c754e6a0e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/1bc293f33ab42628e74fb7d054e3b07c754e6a0e","created_at":"2024-01-29T18:06:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11631483231,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U85819CqzwAAAAK1Sllf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11631483231","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-29T18:06:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11711619825,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U85819CqzwAAAAK6ESLx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11711619825","actor":{"login":"tjamaan","id":22967219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTY3MjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22967219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan","html_url":"https://github.com/tjamaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjamaan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bcd6b350dba6a4408b579f886dd4610d40910cb8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tjamaan/bevy/commits/bcd6b350dba6a4408b579f886dd4610d40910cb8","created_at":"2024-02-06T00:52:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
