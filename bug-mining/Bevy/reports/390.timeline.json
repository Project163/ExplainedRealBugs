This would make observers difficult to handle in type-erased/dynamic environments i.e. would I be able to create multiple observers on an entity for an event with a dynamic id? Or even just two observers with the same signature? Probably not since the states would still conflict, we would still have a footgun, just a more arbitrary one. Scripting scenarios may face trouble with this.\n\nThe alternative would be to add complexity to the existing state so it can act as multiple, which I think would be overkill for a feature that is used in the minority of cases.\n\nThis limitation should be well documented, but even ignoring the above complications I think it's idiomatic to have a 1-to-1 id to observer mapping.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2338524756/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"james-j-obrien","id":30707409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzA3NDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30707409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-j-obrien","html_url":"https://github.com/james-j-obrien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-j-obrien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-j-obrien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-j-obrien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-j-obrien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-j-obrien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-j-obrien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-j-obrien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-j-obrien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james-j-obrien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-10T23:09:16Z","updated_at":"2024-09-10T23:09:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15151","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15151/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15151/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15151/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15151","id":2518133656,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U857E1qS","number":15151,"title":"Removed

Objective\r\n\r\n- Remove any ambiguity around how multiple `Observer` components work on a single `Entity` by completely removing the concept.\r\n- Fixes #15122\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Removed type parameters from `Observer`, relying on a function pointer to provide type information into the relevant aspects of running an observer.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Ran CI locally.\r\n- Checked `observers.rs` example continued to function as expected.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nThis communicates to users of observers that only a single `Observer` can be inserted onto an entity at a time within the established type system. This has been achieved by erasing the type information from the stored `ObserverSystem` and retrieving it again using a function pointer. This has the downside of increasing the size of the `Observer` component and increases the complexity of the observer runner. However, this complexity was already present, and is in my opinion a worthwhile tradeoff for the clearer user experience.\r\n\r\nThe other notable benefit is users no longer need to use the `ObserverState` component to filter for `Observer` entities, and can instead use `Observer` directly.\r\n\r\nTechnically this is a breaking change, since the type signature for `Observer` has changed. However, it was so cumbersome to use that I don't believe there are any instances in the wild of users directly naming `Observer` types, instead relying on `ObserverState`, and the methods provided by `App` and `World`. As can be seen in the diff, this change had very little knock-on effects across Bevy.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nIf you filtered for observers using `Observer<A, B>`, instead filter for an `Observer`. \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15151/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14208193895,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86V3Vm_zwAAAANO39Vn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14208193895","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"be35cba801ab8f4aab7b1263c797a81bcd21f05e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/be35cba801ab8f4aab7b1263c797a81bcd21f05e","created_at":"2024-09-11T01:31:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14208194006,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86V3Vm_zwAAAANO39XW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14208194006","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-11T01:31:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
