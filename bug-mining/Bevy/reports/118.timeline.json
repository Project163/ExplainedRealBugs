Objective\r\n\r\n- Allow configuring of platform-specific panic handlers.\r\n- Remove the silent overwrite of the WASM panic handler\r\n- Closes #12546\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Separates the panic handler to a new plugin, `PanicHandlerPlugin`.\r\n- `PanicHandlerPlugin` was added to `DefaultPlugins`.\r\n- Can be disabled on `DefaultPlugins`, in the case someone needs to configure custom panic handlers.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- A `PanicHandlerPlugin` was added to the `DefaultPlugins`, which now sets sensible target-specific panic handlers.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n- On WASM, the panic stack trace was output to the console through the `BevyLogPlugin`. Since this was separated out into `PanicHandlerPlugin`, you may need to add the new `PanicHandlerPlugin` (included in `DefaultPlugins`).\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- If you used `MinimalPlugins` with `LogPlugin` for a WASM-target build, you will need to add the new `PanicHandlerPlugin` to set the panic behavior to output to the console. Otherwise, you will see the default panic handler (opaque, `unreachable` errors in the console).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12557/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2004427435","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12546#issuecomment-2004427435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12546","id":2004427435,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U853eSKr","user":{"login":"simbleau","id":48108917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MTA4OTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48108917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simbleau","html_url":"https://github.com/simbleau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simbleau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simbleau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simbleau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simbleau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simbleau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simbleau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simbleau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simbleau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simbleau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-18T16:45:56Z","updated_at":"2024-03-18T16:46:05Z","body":"> Thanks for the detective work!
