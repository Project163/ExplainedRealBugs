Objective\r\n\r\n- `MeshPickingBackend` and `SpritePickingBackend` do not have the `Plugin` suffix\r\n- `DefaultPickingPlugins` is masquerading as a `Plugin` when in reality it should be a `PluginGroup`\r\n- Fixes #16081.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Rename some structures:\r\n\r\n|Original Name|New Name|\r\n|-|-|\r\n|`MeshPickingBackend`|`MeshPickingPlugin`|\r\n|`MeshPickingBackendSettings`|`MeshPickingSettings`|\r\n|`SpritePickingBackend`|`SpritePickingPlugin`|\r\n|`UiPickingBackendPlugin`|`UiPickingPlugin`|\r\n\r\n- Make `DefaultPickingPlugins` a `PluginGroup`.\r\n- Because `DefaultPickingPlugins` is within the `DefaultPlugins` plugin group, I also added support for nested plugin groups to the `plugin_group!` macro.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- I used ripgrep to ensure all references were properly renamed.\r\n- For the `plugin_group!` macro, I used `cargo expand` to manually inspect the expansion of `DefaultPlugins`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n>\r\n> All 3 of the changed structures were added after 0.14, so this does not need to be included in the 0.14 to 0.15 migration guide.\r\n\r\n- `MeshPickingBackend` is now named `MeshPickingPlugin`.\r\n- `MeshPickingBackendSettings` is now named `MeshPickingSettings`.\r\n- `SpritePickingBackend` is now named `SpritePickingPlugin`.\r\n- `UiPickingBackendPlugin` is now named `UiPickingPlugin`.\r\n- `DefaultPickingPlugins` is now a a `PluginGroup` instead of a
