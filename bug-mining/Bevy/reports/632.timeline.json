sorry if this is the wrong place, and I'm mostly addressing what you quoted from the discord conversation.\nHaving all UI nodes pickable by default has, in my opinion at least, some drawbacks:\n* Nodes used to layout only will block all things \"below\" it\n* Buttons are annoying since you need to litter all children with `PickingBehavior::IGNORE` or litter all children with observe...\n* It's counter-intuitive to have picking enabled for entities without any picking related component. For example, if you were to add another picking backend for an existing component, you would suddenly most likely break picking for many projects.

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\n\nCurrently `sprite_picking` is relatively expensive, I did some light testing with tracy and 200k sprites with like only 2k of them being in camera view can result in the `sprite_picking` taking 500µs. Which is not much but frame time was 2.66ms so it took \"only\" almost 20% of frame time.\n\nI don't need picking for my sprites and in `debug` mode - without any bevy optimizations - the performace penalty is so big that you can reach single digit fps.\n\nMy specific use-case aside I can imagine that some people would want picking only for some sprites and they might want to turn off picking for the rest.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nFor `sprite_picking` a simple component: \n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, Component)]\npub struct NoSpritePicking;\n```\nthen in the `sprite_picking` system sprite query could be modified from: \n```rust\nsprite_query: Query<(\n        Entity,\n        &Sprite,\n        &GlobalTransform,\n        Option<&PickingBehavior>,\n        &ViewVisibility,\n    )>,\n```\nto\n```rust\nsprite_query: Query<(\n        Entity,\n        &Sprite,\n        &GlobalTransform,\n        Option<&PickingBehavior>,\n        &ViewVisibility,\n    ), Without<NoSpritePicking>>,\n```\n\nThen users if they don't want picking for their sprites they can just add `NoSpritePicking` component to sprite entity.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nI tried adding `PickingBehavior::IGNORE` to my sprites but that did not bring any speed-up.\n\nMaybe it could result in some weird behavior with `PickingBehavior` ? idk\n\nI think it would be nice to have similar marking ignore components for other backends.\nMaybe even global `NoPicking` component or something ?\n\nFaster and better `sprite_picking` system ?- It's currently doing filtering, sorting and filtering on all sprites...\n\nPicking being opt-in ?\n\n## Additional context\n\nRed - current default system with/out `PickingBehavior`\nYellow - my proposed feature with `NoSpritePicking` on my sprites and modified system\n200k sprites (2k on camera, rest off-camera), release mode\n\n**(This is  for my use-case, ofc different apps won't probably see similar

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #16903.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Make sprite picking opt-in by requiring a new `SpritePickingCamera` component for cameras and usage of a new `Pickable` component for entities.\r\n- Update the `sprite_picking` example to reflect these changes.\r\n- Some reflection cleanup (I hope that's ok).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nRan the `sprite_picking` example\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\n<del>\r\n   <ul>\r\n    <li>Is the name `SpritePickable` appropriate?</li>\r\n    <li>Should `SpritePickable` be in `bevy_sprite::prelude?</li>\r\n  </ul> \r\n</del>\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThe sprite picking backend is now strictly opt-in using the `SpritePickingCamera` and `Pickable` components. You should add the `Pickable` component any entities that you want sprite picking to be enabled for, and mark their respective cameras with `SpritePickingCamera`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17225/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15871944419,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86j8WSPzwAAAAOyCqbj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15871944419","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0a9740c18f9ae5338e29e4fbf49c55c34ffdf429","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/0a9740c18f9ae5338e29e4fbf49c55c34ffdf429","created_at":"2025-01-09T18:28:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15871944625,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86j8WSPzwAAAAOyCqex","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15871944625","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-09T18:28:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16177168480,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86j8WSPzwAAAAPEPABg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16177168480","actor":{"login":"mrchantey","id":25616826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE2ODI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25616826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey","html_url":"https://github.com/mrchantey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6f5b59520c548f5a971a7990adfae9e95f0481e0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrchantey/bevy/commits/6f5b59520c548f5a971a7990adfae9e95f0481e0","created_at":"2025-02-04T11:44:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
