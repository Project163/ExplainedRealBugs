In #12243, it is said that we currently have plane as a finite plane, which is true, in our 3d primitives, the plane is defined with a size of vec2.\r\n\r\n_Unless I missunderstood something_, we do miss a finite math primitive but not an actual mesh, because that one is derived from our current infinite 2d plane math primitive, so if I add a rect3d mesh and math primitive, we will end up having two finite ended plane primitive meshes. (plane3d and rect3d)\r\n\r\nSo I guess this work is a precursor to making plane3d to be an infinite plane primitive mesh, which would come later down the line? Want to make sure our intention is to end up with 2 finite primitive plane meshes at the end of this

do think that we need to make it easier/clearer how people can make bounded plane meshes, but:\r\n\r\n- I don't love the name `Rect3d`. It's confusing considering we already have `Rect`, `URect` and `IRect` which are *not* primitives, and it's also inconsistent with the 2D primitive `Rectangle`. It should at *least* be `Rectangle3d` if we want to call it a rectangle, but then we'd need to rename the existing primitive to `Rectangle2d`.\r\n- A rectangle is a 2D shape. One defining factor of the primitives is that they should have no inherent configurable position or orientation outside of what is needed to represent the shape (like triangle points or a plane normal), or using `Transform` or separately allowing transformations for e.g. meshes. Otherwise, they wouldn't really be primitives. A normal is *not* something that mathematically defines a rectangle, so I wouldn't really consider `Rectangle3d` to be a geometric primitive, at least with that name.\r\n- If it is a `Rectangle3d`, which direction is it facing by default? Up, like the default plane, which is probably what the main use case would be? This would be inconsistent with the 2D rectangle which should be facing +Z. I would expect the two rectangles to be the same by default.\r\n- Having a 3D `Plane` mesh that is bounded *is very common*. For example, Godot, [Three.js](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/PlaneGeometry), and even [Blender](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/primitives.html#plane) all have it, and call it a plane. I would personally be very surprised to see it being called something else, as it is quite standard to be looking for \"a ground plane\" (often bounded), and not... a flat surface? A 3D rectangle pointing up? I consider calling the shape a plane (mesh) to be pretty standard in 3D game dev and modelling.\r\n- While planes may technically be unbounded, I don't think there is anything mathematically wrong with applying bounds to them (e.g. restricting X/Y to a certain range, for example). I think of the `size` method for the mesh as doing this, applying bounds to an otherwise unbounded primitive (and the default size is also bounded for rendering and practicality reasons).\r\n\r\nEssentially, I personally don't think it is *wrong* to treat plane meshes as bounded, and I would consider it the standard in the 3D game development and modelling space. I'm also not a fan of the name `Rect3d`, because it is inconsistent, somewhat confusing, and not even really a primitive by our own definitions.\r\n\r\nAgain, I do think it should be clearer how plane meshes work, at least through better documentation and/or nicer helpers and constructors. But calling it something other than a plane would deviate from my expectations considering prior art and what I consider to be a plane in game development. I'd personally just keep it as a `Plane3d`, but improve the documentation, use it in examples (we already do), and maybe add some nicer helpers.\r\n\r\nIf we do insist on a new primitive, I'd at least like a different name than `Rect3d`. `Quad` would be one option (it was the old `Rectangle`), but giving it a normal and making it face up by default would also deviate from what quads typically are in engines, so I don't think it's a great option either.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1989612544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Jondolf","id":57632562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjMyNTYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57632562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jondolf","html_url":"https://github.com/Jondolf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jondolf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jondolf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jondolf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jondolf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jondolf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jondolf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jondolf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jondolf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jondolf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1994375841","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12388#issuecomment-1994375841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12388","id":1994375841,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U85238Kh","user":{"login":"andristarr","id":25829992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODI5OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25829992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andristarr","html_url":"https://github.com/andristarr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andristarr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andristarr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andristarr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andristarr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andristarr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andristarr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andristarr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andristarr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andristarr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-13T13:11:50Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T14:31:22Z","body":"Is there a concensus what we aim for the name?\r\n\r\nIf not I would agree that `Plane3d` is a fitting name enough.
