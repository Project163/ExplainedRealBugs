There's no mesh involved (except from a single quad shared by all particles, which could even be removed). After migrating, I noted that `AlphaMask3d` uses `BinnedRenderPhase`, unlike all other phases Hanabi uses which go through `SortedRenderPhase`. The design of the 2 is quite different, and it seems `BinnedRenderPhase` is coupled with mesh asset rendering.\r\n\r\n**This makes it impossible to ugprade Hanabi.**\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\nRender phase items `AlphaMask3d` are silently discarded, because (I think) `GetFullBatchData::get_binned_index()` returns `None`, since the phase item enqueued doesn't have a mesh.\r\n- I've confirmed with a debugger the phase items get enqueued\r\n- I've confirmed with a debugger that `gpu_processing::batch_and_prepare_binned_render_phase()` gets called (I _think_, because it's all generic code and I can't see the concrete types)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14004/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14004/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
