worked was because it failed the conditional and did not clip the lines in some cases where the original bug was exhibited. the condition was correct before, it turns out, but the clipping logic is wrong: an epsilon is added, with a comment saying it is to avoid falsely culling the vertex due to floating point imprecision leaving it just barely in front of the near plane. However, i do not see why an epsilon should be needed here, or why this should be avoided: triangle primitives are regularly intersecting the clipping plane, that is standard order of business. The entire primitive is not discarded if only part of it is clipped, instead only the visible pixels are rasterized.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- original bug test case by Antony looks right\r\n- both grid test cases look right\r\n- gizmos examples look right","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21503/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20253883942,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U862dQi8zwAAAAS3Ob4m","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20253883942","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e02319fc864ec6cee9ce6060f42da06cb639ece0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/e02319fc864ec6cee9ce6060f42da06cb639ece0","created_at":"2025-10-13T19:09:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20442201831,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U862dQi8zwAAAATCcz7n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20442201831","actor":{"login":"mate-h","id":14351670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzUxNjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14351670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h","html_url":"https://github.com/mate-h","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mate-h/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ea1a73979bd6e0a988315296c02fb03604668260","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mate-h/bevy/commits/ea1a73979bd6e0a988315296c02fb03604668260","created_at":"2025-10-22T23:42:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
