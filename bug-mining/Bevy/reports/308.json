Maybe briefly something on:\r\n\r\n- What is an isometry?\r\n- Why and how is this useful?\r\n- A small code example (creating an isometry and applying a transformation or two with it)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how mathematical we want to be, but I think it could be good to briefly mention that these isometries specifically represent (I think) rigid motion / Euclidean motion (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_transformation)), and are essentially transformations that preserve Euclidean distance (shape and size remains the same), excluding reflections. More formally, these handedness-preserving rigid motions belong to the Special Euclidean group SE(n) where n denotes the dimension, but I'm not sure if we want to be *that* technical here.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @Jondolf in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/14269#discussion_r1672809364_\r\n            ","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14308/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
