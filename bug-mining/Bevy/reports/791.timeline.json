Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #18781\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Moved `LogPlugin` into its own file gated behind a new `tracing` feature.\r\n- Used `log` instead of `tracing` where possible.\r\n- Exposed a new `tracing` feature in `bevy` which enables `bevy_log/tracing`.\r\n- Gated `LogPlugin` from `DefaultPlugins` on `tracing` feature.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- CI\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- If you were previously using `bevy_log` with default features disabled, enable the new `std` and `tracing` features.\r\n- If you were using `bevy` with the default features disabled, enable the new `tracing` feature.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the diffs in this PR come from moving `LogPlugin` into its own file. This just makes the PR less noisy, since the alternative is excessive `#[cfg(feature = \"tracing\")]` directives all over the
