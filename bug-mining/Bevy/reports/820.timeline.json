Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #18945\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nEntities that are not visible in any view (camera or light), get their render meshes removed. When they become visible somewhere again, the meshes get recreated and assigned possibly different ids.\r\n\r\nPoint/spot light visible entities weren't cleared when the lights themseves went out of view, which caused them to try to queue these fake visible entities for rendering every frame.  The shadow phase cache usually flushes non visible entites, but because of this bug it never flushed them and continued to queue meshes with outdated ids.\r\n\r\nThe simple solution is to every frame clear all visible entities for all point/spot lights that may or may not be visible. The visible entities get repopulated directly afterwards. I also renamed the `global_point_lights` to `global_visible_clusterable` to make it clear that it includes only visible things.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Tested with the code from the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19265/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17702118353,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U860GaBmzwAAAAQfIOPR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17702118353","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4d1b045855ff10fe5cd10775f7a3e9158085f191","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/4d1b045855ff10fe5cd10775f7a3e9158085f191","created_at":"2025-05-18T06:42:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17702118399,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U860GaBmzwAAAAQfIOP_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17702118399","actor":{"login":"superdump","id":302146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump","html_url":"https://github.com/superdump","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-18T06:42:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17702920287,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U860GaBmzwAAAAQfLSBf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17702920287","actor":{"login":"eero-lehtinen","id":7013023,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMTMwMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7013023?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eero-lehtinen","html_url":"https://github.com/eero-lehtinen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eero-lehtinen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eero-lehtinen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eero-lehtinen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eero-lehtinen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eero-lehtinen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eero-lehtinen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eero-lehtinen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eero-lehtinen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eero-lehtinen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8a40e26e190ec59f4cd37c10cd020bf47432dfa8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eero-lehtinen/bevy/commits/8a40e26e190ec59f4cd37c10cd020bf47432dfa8","created_at":"2025-05-18T10:58:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17891984221,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U860GaBmzwAAAAQqcgNd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17891984221","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","follow

pull request includes updates to dependencies, color handling, and rendering logic for the `svo-rs` project. The changes improve compatibility with newer versions of Bevy, enhance color representation using sRGB, and simplify rendering code by adopting newer APIs.\r\n\r\n### Dependency Updates:\r\n* Updated Bevy dependencies and related libraries to newer versions (`Cargo.toml`). This includes moving from `0.12.0` to `0.16.1` for Bevy and adding `bevy-inspector-egui` for debugging and visualization purposes.\r\n\r\n### Rendering and Color Handling:\r\n* Replaced `bevy_render::Color` with `bevy_color::Color` and updated color definitions to use sRGB for more accurate color representation across multiple files (`src/sparse_voxel_octree.rs`, `src/voxelized_mesh.rs`).
