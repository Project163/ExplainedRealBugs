[bevy_smooth_pixel_camera](https://github.com/doonv/bevy_smooth_pixel_camera)  to https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/44424391fe217d9b0b4b0be2649b44a994983a59 (I know that it's caused by this exact commit)\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\nThe viewport texture is no longer updated unless I move my cursor or resized the window.\r\n\r\nThis means **the viewport texture is not getting updated by the world camera** (Which is supposed to render to that texture via `RenderTarget::Image`). It updates when I move my cursor because of my `update_viewport_size` system, which only runs when the `Window` is changed. This system, among other things, resizes the viewport texture with `Image::resize`. And that appears to make the texture update for some reason.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\n[Here is the source code that reproduces this issue](https://github.com/doonv/bevy_smooth_pixel_camera/blob/temp-debug-update/src/systems.rs#L134).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11343/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1891012650","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11240#issuecomment-1891012650","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11240","id":1891012650,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U85wtpAq","user":{"login":"doonv","id":58695417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4Njk1NDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58695417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doonv","html_url":"https://github.com/doonv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doonv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doonv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doonv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doonv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doonv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doonv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doonv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doonv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doonv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-14T17:29:22Z","updated_at":"2024-01-14T17:29:22Z","body":"> In both case, triggering change detection on the material / the sprite updates it\r\n\r\nCould you elaborate on that?

Objective\r\n\r\nAfter #10520, I was experiencing seriously degraded performance that ended up being due to never-drained `AssetEvent` events causing havoc inside `extract_render_asset::<A>`. The same events being read over and over again meant the same assets were being prepared every frame for eternity. For what it's worth, I was noticing this on a static scene about every 3rd or so time running my project.\r\n\r\n* References #10520\r\n* Fixes #11240\r\n\r\nWhy these events aren't sometimes drained between frames is beyond me and perhaps worthy of another investigation, but the approach in this PR effectively restores the original cached `EventReader` behavior (which fixes it).\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nI followed the [`CachedSystemState` example](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/3a666cab23eab5e83552ae074f47d8663221311e/crates/bevy_ecs/src/system/function_system.rs#L155) to make sure that the `EventReader` state is cached between frames like it used to be when it was an argument of
