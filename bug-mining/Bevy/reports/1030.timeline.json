I could also reproduce it partially with just 2 simple rgb `StandardMaterial`.\n\nPartially because, I now simply get some runs with both shapes rendering properly, and some runs with just the sphere rendering and not the cube. The color swap does not seem to appear with this setup.\n\nMinimal repro:\n\n```rust\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::new()\n    .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n    .add_systems(Startup,

have created a repo to test this issue, added bevy-inspector-egui to check entities. It seems that the mesh shows up when I checks the mesh3d component(keep this unfolded also works) in inspector ui, so probably it didn't get updated or something(or lazy loading)?\n\nA screenshot shows the sphere shows up after I click the mesh3d component.\n\n![20250428_19h19m12s_grim.png](https://s2.loli.net/2025/04/28/2QTxuHbEJD1ihGw.png)\n\nMy repo:

has also been an issue for me while trying to update to Bevy 0.16 from 0.15.  I'm using an Intel integrated GPU and need to be able to support users with that setup.  The problem is fixed for me by adding `NoIndirectDrawing` to the camera.\n\nFor reference, my use case has lots of custom 3d meshes, and the problem was that some of them would just not be visible at various times.  I was also seeing occasional rendering artifacts like huge triangles between different meshes.  It seems like all of that is fixed with `NoIndirectDrawing`.\n\nThe meshes would tend to disappear (or show up) with camera movement, but there didn't seem to be any particular predictability to the behavior.  One thing I did notice is that if the cursor went over an invisible mesh, sometimes that would cause it to become visible again.  So a picking hover event may have reset the rendering for that mesh or something?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3087171932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zachbateman","id":39414345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDE0MzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39414345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachbateman","html_url":"https://github.com/zachbateman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachbateman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachbateman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachbateman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachbateman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachbateman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachbateman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachbateman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachbateman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zachbateman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19192908628,"node_id":"DEME_lADODf6-U86zoK8YzwAAAAR3_ItU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19192908628","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-17T22:26:06Z","milestone":{"title":"0.16.2"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
