Use all of the constructors (including default constructors) directly defined in the spawned component’s require list\n> 2. In the order the requires are defined in #[require()], recursively visit the require list of each of the components in the list (this is a Depth First Search). When a constructor is found, it will only be used if one has not already been found.\n\nHowever, this is not what actually happens. For example, consider this case:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Component)]\n#[require(B)]\nstruct A;\n\n#[derive(Component, Default)]\n#[require(C, D(|| D(1)))]\nstruct B;\n\n#[derive(Component, Default)]\n#[require(D(|| D(2)))]\nstruct C;\n\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct D(u8);\n```\n\nNow suppose we spawn `A`. Following the steps described in the docs to determine which constructor will be used for `D`:\n\n1. The \"spawned component\" is `A`, which does not have a constructor for `D`, so go to step 2.\n2. A DFS will visit the components in the order `A B C D(2) D(1)`. So when `D(2)` is visited, it will be used because `D` hasn't been found yet; and when `D(1)` is visited, it will not be used because `D` has been found already.\n\nThis suggests that `D(2)` will be used as the constructor. But that's incorrect: `D(1)` is actually used.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16494/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
