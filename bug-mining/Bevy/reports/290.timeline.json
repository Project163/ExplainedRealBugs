started updating to the 0.14 rc release. Each commit has a link to a PR that enacted the change.\r\n\r\n* [12997](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12997): rename `multi-threaded` feature to `multi_threaded`\r\n* [12827](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12827) `RenderAssets<Image>` is now `RenderAssets<GpuImage>`\r\n* [12732](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12732) `FloatOrd` is now in `bevy_math`\r\n* [12889](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12889) Gpu Frustum Culling removed the `dynamic_offset` of `Transparent2d`\r\n* [12453](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12453) Render Phases are now binned and sorted.\r\n* [9202](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/9202) SubApp access has changed from Result to Option\r\n* [11698](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11698) `GpuImage` now uses UVec2s\r\n* [12791](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12791) the primitive_topology field on GpuMesh was removed.\r\n* [12216](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12216) introduced an argument `&mut MeshVertexBufferLayouts` to `get_mesh_vertex_buffer_layout`, which bevy_ecs_tilemap calls in `RenderChunk2d::prepare`\r\n- [12163](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12163) bevy_color was created and Color handling has changed. Specifically `Color::as_linear_rgba_f32` has been removed and we have to go through `LinearRgb` using `.linear()`.\r\n- [12582](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12582) divided `VisibleEntities` into separate lists. Specify the entity type we want\r\n- [9202](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/9202) changed world access to functions. [relevent line](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/9202/files#diff-b2fba3a0c86e496085ce7f0e3f1de5960cb754c7d215ed0f087aa556e529f97fR640)\r\n  - This also surfaced [12655](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12655) which removed `Into<AssetId<T>>` for `Handle<T>`. using a reference or .id() is the solution here.\r\n -  [12551](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12551) Removed `World::cell()`... but we don't need it or the replacement anyway.\r\n- [12582](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12582) `check_visibility` must be implemented for the \"renderable\" tilemap entities\r\n- [13289](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/13489) introduced matrix naming changes for `view.view_proj`\r\n\r\n## Current Status\r\n\r\nCode compiles.

LUTs generation on fly if ktx2 is not enabled\r\n\r\n# Objective\r\n\r\n- Partially addresses #13728  .\r\n- If default features are disabled some subcrates has implicit but not explicit dependencies.\r\nFor example `bevy_core_pipeline` adds `SmaaPlugin` which wants `ktx2` textures, `ktx2` uses `zstd` for supercompression\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Added feature `smaa_luts`. If enabled SMAA uses LUTs from ktx2 files, if disabled SMAA uses LUTs generated on fly. Generators are based on on Jorge Jimenez code for [AreaTex](https://github.com/iryoku/smaa/blob/master/Scripts/AreaTex.py) and [SearchTex](https://github.com/iryoku/smaa/blob/master/Scripts/SearchTex.py)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- I ran reproducing example from #13728 with enabled bevy_pbr and got no panics\r\n- I made

PR to match the Bevy 0.14.0-rc.2 release. Most of the change seem straightforward, although I'm not as familiar with the internals here as I'd like.
