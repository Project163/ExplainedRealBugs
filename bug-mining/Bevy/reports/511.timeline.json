Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #16006\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nWe currently re-export `cosmic_text`, which is seemingly motivated by the desire to use `cosmic_text::FontSystem` in `bevy_text` public APIs instead of our `CosmicFontSystem` resource wrapper type.\r\n\r\nThis change makes `bevy_text` a \"true\" abstraction over `cosmic_text` (it in fact, was already built to be that way generally and has this one \"leak\").\r\n\r\nThis allows us to remove the `cosmic_text` re-export, which helps clean up the Rust Analyzer imports and generally makes this a \"cleaner\" API.
