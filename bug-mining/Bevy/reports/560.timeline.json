me if I'm wrong but I think one use case for this is when you have rounded button images/sprites? For those, at least in my case, I don't want to trigger the interaction on the transparent pixels, i.e. only trigger interactions on clicks inside the round parts of the image. In that case, I'd agree I expected this behavior by default.\r\n\r\nThis issue is for the sprite picking backend, but is there any overlap with doing this for existing bevy UI buttons with images? I have some UI buttons with a `UiImage` as its child, and I've wanted a way to avoid triggering interactions when clicking on the non-rounded parts. The [sprite picking backend operates on `Sprite`s only], so I don't expect this new picking backend to work for `UiImage`s. It's fine if the answer is \"that's a new issue\", but I did wonder if they were somehow covered by the same approach.\r\n\r\n[sprite picking backend operates on `Sprite`s only]: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/e320fa0738e3f4582b0d61db85a00d7a70b676eb/crates/bevy_sprite/src/picking_backend.rs#L32-L43","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2311520524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mgi388","id":135186256,"node_id":"U_kgDOCA7HUA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135186256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388","html_url":"https://github.com/mgi388","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgi388/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2312461944","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14929#issuecomment-2312461944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14929","id":2312461944,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86J1V54","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-27T12:43:53Z","updated_at":"2024-08-27T12:43:53Z","body":"For the case of rounded buttons specifically, we should be able to do a faster test.

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nIn Bevy 0.14, areas removed from buttons via rounded corners still count as hits, changing the value of `Interaction` components incorrectly.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nThe picking backend should exclude these by default, by getting information about the actual shape of the button.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nWe could use alpha testing, but that's likely slower and generally not desirable in the context of UI.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nRelated to but distinct from https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14929, which is for sprites and uses a slower but more general

```\r\n>               > Not sure what you mean by \"test against alpha\".

I think most users would expect fully transparent pixels to not be hittable. Might be something where the backend/component specifies a threshold, so any alpha below that value will be ignored. Doesn't need to be added right now, but would be nice to mention in the plugin docs.\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> _Originally posted by @aevyrie in [#14757 (comment)](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/14757#issuecomment-2297442070)_\r\n> \r\n> We can either add a whole new backend for this, or add a configuration option to the existing backend. Checking the alpha value of each pixel is more expensive but more intuitive and should be enabled by default with a way to toggle it off.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeconding this, it'd be very useful in the project

Objective\r\n\r\n- Allow bevy_sprite_picking backend to pass through transparent sections of the sprite.\r\n- Fixes #14929\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- After sprite picking detects the cursor is within a sprites rect, check the pixel at that location on the texture and check that it meets an optional transparency cutoff. Change originally created for mod_picking on bevy 0.14 (https://github.com/aevyrie/bevy_mod_picking/pull/373)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Ran Sprite Picking example to check it was working both with transparency enabled and disabled\r\n- ModPicking version is currently in use in my own isometric game where this has been an extremely noticeable issue\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n![Sprite Picking Text](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76568c0d-c359-422b-942d-17c84d3d3009)\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nSprite picking now ignores transparent regions (with an alpha value less than or equal to 0.1). To configure this, modify the `SpriteBackendSettings`
