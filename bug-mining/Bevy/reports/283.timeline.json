Can you double check / and or test against the PR if you are still seeing the crash?\r\n\r\nhave you tried commenting out the line mentioned? Otherwise the issue doesn't show up.\r\nIn any case, I checked out your branch and it did not fix the issue. \r\n\r\nHOWEVER. I literally had a fever dream where I figured out the source of the problem, so I tracked that down and voila!\r\n\r\nThis line: \r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/03f63e72cfdb1d8a305bd034b0088e850ed3f064/crates/bevy_ui/src/layout/mod.rs#L194 \r\nNeeds to move to L219. I _think_ the issue is with the queries, sometimes we remove the nodes from the slotmap before we try to remove / update their children. (`RemovedComponent<Children>` will contain all entities form `RemovedComponents<Node>` as it is a subset of it.) Or maybe the `is_changed` children will contain entries we removed earlier due to caching? \r\n\r\nEdit: I now realize that the line I mentioned (removal of the `Node`) is what trips the panic. However I already debugged that the erroneous state occurs _before_ we try to remove the node and syncing the children solved it before.\r\n\r\nSomeone who better understands the whole UI update process needs to validate this claim tho. But moving the line resolved the issue I had and I didn't see any adverse effect.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2184912312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eidloi","id":20684057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjg0MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20684057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi","html_url":"https://github.com/eidloi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"eidloi","id":20684057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjg0MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20684057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi","html_url":"https://github.com/eidloi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-23T14:03:20Z","updated_at":"2024-06-23T14:03:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13990","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13990/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13990/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13990/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/13990","id":2368578740,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U85zSMjV","number":13990,"title":"fix panic: invalid SlotMap key used","user":{"login":"eidloi","id":20684057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjg0MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20684057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi","html_url":"https://github.com/eidloi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619323,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Bug","name":"C-Bug","color":"d73a4a","default":false,"description":"An unexpected or incorrect behavior"},{"id":2045383863,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQ1MzgzODYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-Rendering","name":"A-Rendering","color":"C6A751","default":false,"description":"Drawing game state to the screen"},{"id":2276469463,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjc2NDY5NDYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-UI","name":"A-UI","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Graphical user interfaces, styles, layouts, and widgets"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.
