Objective\r\n\r\n- `bevy_render` should not depend on `bevy_winit`\r\n- Fixes #15565\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- `bevy_render` no longer depends on `bevy_winit`\r\n- The following is behind the `custom_cursor` feature\r\n  - Move custom cursor code from `bevy_render` to `bevy_winit` behind the `custom_cursor` feature\r\n  - `bevy_winit` now depends on `bevy_render` (for `Image` and `TextureFormat`)\r\n  - `bevy_winit` now depends on `bevy_asset` (for `Assets`, `Handle` and `AssetId`)\r\n  - `bevy_winit` now depends on `bytemuck` (already in tree)\r\n- Custom cursor code in `bevy_winit` reworked to use `AssetId` (other than that it is taken over 1:1)\r\n- Rework `bevy_winit` custom cursor interface visibility now that the logic is all contained in `bevy_winit`\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- I ran the screenshot and window_settings examples\r\n- Tested on linux wayland so far\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n`CursorIcon` and `CustomCursor`  previously provided by `bevy::render::view::cursor` is now available from `bevy::winit`.\r\nA new feature `custom_cursor` enables this functionality (default feature).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2394286344","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15565#issuecomment-2394286344","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15565","id":2394286344,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86OtekI","user":{"login":"KirmesBude","id":8339817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzk4MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8339817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirmesBude","html_url":"https://github.com/KirmesBude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirmesBude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirmesBude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirmesBude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirmesBude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirmesBude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirmesBude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirmesBude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirmesBude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirmesBude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-04T17:58:09Z","updated_at":"2024-10-04T17:58:09Z","body":"Seems
