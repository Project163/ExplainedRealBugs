then.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2149081690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Magnitus-","id":6245073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDUwNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6245073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnitus-","html_url":"https://github.com/Magnitus-","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnitus-/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnitus-/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnitus-/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnitus-/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnitus-/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnitus-/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnitus-/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnitus-/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Magnitus-/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15374836570,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86BhQUYzwAAAAOUaWNa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15374836570","actor":{"login":"marijanp","id":13599169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTk5MTY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13599169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijanp","html_url":"https://github.com/marijanp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijanp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijanp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijanp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijanp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijanp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijanp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijanp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijanp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marijanp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-21T02:03:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"rparrett","id":200550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett","html_url":"https://github.com/rparrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-02T05:07:35Z","updated_at":"2024-12-02T05:07:35Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16598","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16598/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16598/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16598/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/16598","id":2710478481,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86DsXTV","number":16598,"title":"Moving

Objective\r\nFix: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12359\r\n\r\nWanted to make it clear what happens when audio is being played, and the source is related to the `PlaybackMode`.\r\nYou're either playing sound effects that are temporary in lifetime, or constant repeated music.\r\nSome sound effects related to existing entity while others are children of said entities. \r\nI wanted the API to actually reflect that, instead of being split over two components. \r\nIt requires explicit input about `PlaybackMode `\r\n\r\nThis break existing code in two places: \r\n* When `AudioPlayer::new()` is used it changes default mode to `Remove`, current default is `Once`.\r\n* Tuple struct syntax requires as second argument. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n* Changing the default `PlaybackMode` to `PlaybackMode::Remove`\r\n* Adding `PlaybackMode` to `AudioPlayer`\r\n* Adding convenience methods to `AudioPlayer` to create with different `PlaybackMode`s\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n> - Did you test these changes? If so, how?\r\n\r\n* Ran each audio example. \r\n* Ran tests\r\n\r\n> - Are there any parts that need more testing?\r\n\r\nPerformance? Since `AudioPlayer` now holds `PlaybackMode` there can have been a difference in internal optimizations that I might have missed. \r\n\r\n> - How can other people (reviewers) test your changes? Is there anything specific they need to know?\r\n\r\nRun audio examples. \r\n\r\n> - If relevant, what platforms did you test these changes on, and are there any important ones you can't test?\r\n\r\nTested only on `macOS`, I don't think it's relevant for other platforms unless there are performance implications with the new default `remove` for `PlaybackMode`. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n### Changed the default behaviour to be `remove`\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n    pub fn new(source: Handle<AudioSource>) -> Self {\r\n        Self(source, PlaybackMode::default())\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Introducing new functions to create `AudioPlayer`\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n    /// Creates a new [`AudioPlayer`] that plays the sound once.\r\n    pub fn with_once(source: Handle<AudioSource>) -> Self {\r\n        Self(source, PlaybackMode::Once)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /// Creates a new [`AudioPlayer`] that loops the sound forever.\r\n    pub fn with_loop(source: Handle<AudioSource>) -> Self {\r\n        Self(source, PlaybackMode::Loop)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /// Creates a new [`AudioPlayer`] that despawns the entity when the sound finishes playing.\r\n    pub fn with_despawn(source: Handle<AudioSource>) -> Self {\r\n        Self(source, PlaybackMode::Despawn)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /// Creates a new [`AudioPlayer`] that removes the audio component from the entity when the sound finishes playing.\r\n    pub fn with_remove(source: Handle<AudioSource>) -> Self {\r\n        Self(source, PlaybackMode::Remove)\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Examples: \r\n\r\nOld\r\n```rust\r\n    commands.spawn(AudioPlayer(\r\n        asset_server.load(\"sounds/Windless Slopes.ogg\"),\r\n    ));\r\n```\r\nNew\r\n```rust\r\n    commands.spawn(AudioPlayer::with_once(\r\n        asset_server.load(\"sounds/Windless Slopes.ogg\"),\r\n    ));\r\n```\r\n\r\nOld\r\n```rust\r\n        commands.spawn((\r\n            AudioPlayer(pitch_assets.add(Pitch::new(frequency.0, Duration::new(1, 0)))),\r\n            PlaybackSettings::DESPAWN,\r\n        ));\r\n```\r\nNew\r\n```rust\r\n        commands.spawn(AudioPlayer(\r\n            pitch_assets.add(Pitch::new(frequency.0, Duration::new(1, 0))),\r\n            PlaybackMode::Despawn,\r\n        ));\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16598/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2536422301","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12359#issuecomment-2536422301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12359","id":2536422301,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86XLrud","user":{"login":"rparrett","id":200550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett","html_url":"https://github.com/rparrett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rparrett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-11T16:08:13Z","updated_at":"2024-12-11T16:08:35Z","body":"I don't think that I agree with the premise of this issue anymore.
