This worked without flicker before.\n\n## What went wrong\n\nI wrote a clustered terrain generator for a strategy game (WIP). The terrain can be changed during gameplay. \nAfter a cluster has been updated, I retrieve the meshes of the adjacent terrain clusters to average the normals at the borders between the clusters. \n\nStarting with 0.16 just retrieving the mesh (independent if I change the mesh or not) to modify it by \n`if let Some(other_mesh) = meshes.get_mut(other_mesh_handle) {[....]}`\ncreates a flickering mesh. It looks like that another mesh is displayed for a single frame, before the correct mesh is displayed again.\n\n## Additional information\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/236a0603-b7af-4879-9e14-341849524fe1\n\nIn this example I am **not** altering the adjacent meshes. I am just retrieving a mutable borrow from the AssetServer.\nIf I only retrieve an immutable borrow the flicker disappears.\n","closed_by":{"login":"james7132","id":3137680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzc2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132","html_url":"https://github.com/james7132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19409/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
