This is the default behaviour of most applications because relying on a static list of root certificates puts the onus on the application developer to regularly keep the certificates up to date otherwise the app can become insecure and incompatible with the internet. See [here](https://github.com/rustls/rustls-platform-verifier/tree/main/rustls-platform-verifier#deployment-considerations) for more info on `rustls-platform-verifier` vs `webpki-roots`.\n\nImplementing this would be very straightforward but making it customisable would require more design (if its enabled by default then how would someone exclude rustls-platform-verifier as a feature and how would this fit in with exposing more of ureq's options in a cross-platform compatible way).\n\n## Additional context\n\nThis only applies to ureq so this issue doesn't affect wasm.","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20803/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
