It should probably cause bevy_math itself to use the libm versions of functions as well. \r\n\r\n## What should be done?\r\n\r\nWe should follow in glam's footsteps here and have a `math` module (or whatever) inside bevy_math which is compiled to either the platform defaults (e.g. `f32::sqrt`) or the libm versions (`libm::sqrtf`) depending on the feature flag. Then our internals would be refactored to use (for example) `math::sqrt` instead of `f32::sqrt` directly. \r\n\r\nThis is a fairly substantial undertaking, even if it is basically a trivial matter of finding things and replacing them.\r\n\r\nAnother concern that I have about this is that it's unlikely that literally all relevant math in bevy is actually self-contained in the bevy_math module (e.g. bevy_transform and bevy_color also do some math), so it seems like this is bound to be \"leaky\" regardless. On the other hand, this could be useful for library authors depending on bevy_math to get access to additional determinacy guarantees.
