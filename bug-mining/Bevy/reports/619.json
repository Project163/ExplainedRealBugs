Adapted from code in the official [UI example](https://bevyengine.org/examples/ui-user-interface/ui/).\n```rust\n#[derive(Component, Default)]\n#[require(Camera2d, IsDefaultUiCamera)] // <- error here\nstruct MenuCamera;\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\nIsDefaultUiCamera doesnt implement default. This is something bevy should always do when components can be \"required\" in my opinion. The IsDefaultUiCamera component is a unit-like struct, so there is no data to attach either.\n\n## Additional information\n\nThis is mostly a reminder/todo for myself. It's a small thing to fix, but I'm sure there are other components that need the same sort of attention. I'm also fairly sure this may be a dupe, but with 2k+ issues I don't want to spend the time to find it.\n\nFeel free to link a dupe if you know one, this feels like something that could be an overarching issue and the more components that can be fixed in a single commit the better imo.\n\nIf someone wants to fix this, thanks in advance!","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17052/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17052/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
