Having the fragment shader disables some really important hardware optimizations that exist for depth-only vertex-only passes.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nFor non-alpha masked draws, on supported platforms, use https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/struct.PrimitiveState.html#structfield.unclipped_depth instead of setting the DEPTH_CLAMP_ORTHO shader def.\n\nAdditionally when we do use DEPTH_CLAMP_ORTHO, we should not pass the entire `clip_position_unclamped: vec4<f32>` from the vertex shader to the fragment shader, we only need to pass the `z` value.\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nWe could remove DEPTH_CLAMP_ORTHO entirely, and instead expand the shadow view frustum either by some fixed amount, or based on the AABB's of entities in the scene.\n\n## Additional context\n\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8877\nhttps://therealmjp.github.io/posts/shadow-maps/#disabling-z-clipping\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16078/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
