We don't currently *have* a good example to test that though: lemme make an issue.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @alice-i-cecile in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/10610#issuecomment-1909037889_\r\n            \r\nChanging material properties (rather than just handles to a new material) is a powerful and flexible tool for creating visual effects. However, we don't clearly demonstrate this to new users, and *also* don't have a good tool to detect performance changes here.\r\n\r\nWe should make an example that demonstrates this in a semi-realistic and appealing way. If it doesn't stress performance adequately, we should also make a stress test.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
