Objective\r\n\r\nThe `ui_layout_system` relies on change detection to sync parent-child relation to taffy. The children need to by synced before node removal to avoid trying to set deleted nodes as children (due to how the different queries collect entities). This however may leave nodes that were removed set as children to other nodes in special cases.\r\n\r\nFixes #11385\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution is simply to re-sync the changed children after the nodes are removed.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTested with `sickle_ui` where docking zone highlights would end up glitched when docking was done in a certain manner:\r\n- run the `docking_zone_splits` example\r\n- pop out a tab from the top\r\n- dock the floating panel in the center right\r\n- grab another tab and try to hover the original static docking zone: the highlight is semi-stuck\r\n- (NOTE: sometimes it worked even without the fix due to scheduling order not producing the bugged query results)\r\n\r\nAfter the fix, the issue is no longer present.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The performance impact should be minimal, as the child sync relies on change detection. The change detection was also the reason the parent nodes remained \"stuck\" with the phantom children if no other update were done to them.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13688056618,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U858VpyhzwAAAAMv3ysq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13688056618","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"396153ae59b7c98bd9b12001135bf863aa33a0a7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/396153ae59b7c98bd9b12001135bf863aa33a0a7","created_at":"2024-07-30T00:04:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13688056712,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U858VpyhzwAAAAMv3yuI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13688056712","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-07-30T00:04:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13744822902,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U858VpyhzwAAAAMzQVp2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13744822902","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ebfe545f796a8d5073ad25d1832a6d983cb0e9e8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/ebfe545f796a8d5073ad25d1832a6d983cb0e9e8","created_at":"2024-08-02T17:26:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
