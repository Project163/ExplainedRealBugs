we re-used the `CursorIcon` component which was intended to be placed on the window, and expanded its use so that it could be placed on any hoverable entity.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we restore `CursorIcon`

custom cursors in BSN templates without having to add new trait impls in bevy_winit.\r\n\r\nBikeshedding on the name `EntityCursor` is welcome. Originally I had thought `NodeCursor`, but it's not just for Nodes, it can be placed on any hoverable entity.\r\n\r\nNote: this was discussed in Discord with

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #20182, #20381\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis requires moving the `CursorIcon` API  out from `bevy_winit`. The natural place to put `CursorIcon` is in `bevy_window` but `bevy_asset` depends on `bevy_window` so the custom cursor image asset creates a circular dependency. Went to move `CustomCursorImage`  into `bevy_image` instead but that just creates the same cycle with an extra step. I wasn't able to think of any other sensible alternative, so I went to the extremely silly lengths of adding an entire new `bevy_cursor_icon` crate.\r\n\r\nThe `bevy_window` and `bevy_winit` types that are used to control the cursor appearance: `SystemCursorIcon`,  `CursorIcon`, `CustomCursor`, and `CustomCursorImage` have all been moved into `bevy_cursor_icon`. \r\n\r\nThere's also a plugin `CursorIconPlugin` that just exists to init the `CustomIcon` resource.\r\n\r\nIt does completely decouple cursor icon customisation from windowing I suppose but whether that's useful, really doesn't seem like it 😅 .\r\n\r\nInitially called the crate `bevy_cursor` but seemed ambiguous (and is already in use apparently). Just saw that @mgi388 suggested `bevy_cursor_icon`, switched to it as more descriptive than `bevy_window_cursor`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20384/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20384/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3146539140","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20182#issuecomment-3146539140","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20182","id":3146539140,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U867jGCE","user":{"login":"ickshonpe","id":27962798,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTYyNzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27962798?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe","html_url":"https://github.com/ickshonpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ickshonpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-02T14:29:15Z","updated_at":"2025-08-02T14:29:15Z","body":"Didn't

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #20182\r\nFixes #20381\r\nAlternative to #20384\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the problems above is that `bevy_window` includes `bevy_window::ANDROID_APP`, which prevents it from behaving as a backend-agnostic window API. This forces `bevy_asset` to take a dependency on `bevy_window` just to provide android support, which is unnecessary. This in turn prevents `bevy_window` from owning the relevant CursorIcon / CustomCursor types, because it would need to depend on `bevy_asset`, which creates a circular dependency.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to move `ANDROID_APP` to a new `bevy_android` crate, which `bevy_asset` can then depend on. This allows the \"backend-agnostic\" cursor types to live in `bevy_window`, which then allows `bevy_feathers` to remove its dependency on `bevy_winit`. \r\n\r\nWhile I was touching this code I also chose to make `CustomCursor::Url` available on all platforms. This is up to the backends to implement (or not implement). It also means that users no longer need to know the magic `#[cfg]` block to make their code compile on all platforms. `bevy_winit` currently logs a `error_once` if it is ever used on a platform where it is not supported.
