Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #11679\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Added `IntoSystem::system_type_id` which returns the equivalent of `system.into_system().type_id()` without construction. This allows for getting the `TypeId` of functions (a function is an unnamed type and therefore you cannot call `TypeId::of::<apply_deferred::System>()`)\r\n- Added default implementation of `System::type_id` to ensure consistency between implementations. Some returned `Self`, while others were returning an inner value instead. This ensures consistency with `IntoSystem::system_type_id`.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nIf you use `System::type_id()` on function systems (exclusive or not), ensure you are comparing its value to other `System::type_id()` calls, or `IntoSystem::system_type_id()`.\r\n\r\nThis code wont require any changes, because `IntoSystem`'s are directly compared to each other.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn test_system() {}\r\n\r\nlet type_id = test_system.type_id();\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\n// No change required\r\nassert_eq!(test_system.type_id(), type_id);\r\n```\r\n\r\nLikewise, this code wont, because `System`'s are directly compared.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn test_system() {}\r\n\r\nlet type_id = IntoSystem::into_system(test_system).type_id();\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\n// No change required\r\nassert_eq!(IntoSystem::into_system(test_system).type_id(), type_id);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe below _does_ require a change, since you're comparing a `System` type to a `IntoSystem` type.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn test_system() {}\r\n\r\n// Before\r\nassert_eq!(test_system.type_id(), IntoSystem::into_system(test_system).type_id());\r\n\r\n// After\r\nassert_eq!(test_system.system_type_id(), IntoSystem::into_system(test_system).type_id());\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11728/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11719603568,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U85-KD39zwAAAAK6ivVw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11719603568","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"950bd2284dd3ac4c105d3ca21c3421859120928f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/950bd2284dd3ac4c105d3ca21c3421859120928f","created_at":"2024-02-06T15:00:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11719603878,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U85-KD39zwAAAAK6ivam","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11719603878","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-06T15:00:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
