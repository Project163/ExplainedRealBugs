However, there doesn't seem to be an API to initialize it with a specific value.\r\n\r\nThe only way that I found outside of scheduling a startup system (which I can't do in my case) is to do this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// In a plugin's build method\r\n\r\napp.init_gizmo_group::<PhysicsGizmos>();\r\n\r\nlet mut store = app.world.resource_mut::<GizmoConfigStore>();\r\nlet config = store.config_mut::<PhysicsGizmos>().0;\r\nconfig.line_width = 1.5;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is not ideal. I think it also has issues if the plugin is added before the `GizmoPlugin`.\r\n\r\nMy use case is that bevy_xpbd has a `PhysicsDebugConfig` resource and a `PhysicsDebugRenderer` system parameter that renders colliders, joints, contacts, and so on. With the new gizmo API, I'm combining these into a single `PhysicsGizmos` gizmo config group that stores the config that was previously stored in `PhysicsDebugConfig` and has some methods for e.g. rendering colliders.\r\n\r\nI need to (1) configure some properties of the `GizmoConfig` to non-default values, and (2) give people an easy API to configure `PhysicsGizmos` for e.g. disabling collider rendering. This should be doable during initialization, not just in a system. I can not make a `Startup` system for it as it could conflict with users' systems that use `GizmoConfigStore` in that schedule.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nAdd an `insert_gizmo_group` method to `App`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\napp.insert_gizmo_group(PhysicsGizmos {\r\n    // ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere must also be a way to set the `GizmoConfig` associated with the gizmo group. This could be an `insert_gizmo_config` or `configure_gizmo_config` method:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\napp.insert_gizmo_config::<PhysicsGizmos>(GizmoConfig {\r\n    // ...\r\n});\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11569/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
