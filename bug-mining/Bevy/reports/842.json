So I think we should rename `Timer::paused` to `Timer::is_paused`, leaving `Timer::paused` throughout 0.17, and removing it in 0.18.\n2. Similarly for `Timer::finished` -> `Timer::is_finished`.\n3. I note there is `Timer::just_finished`. I honestly don't know about that one. I think `Timer::is_just_finished` probably works and follows the rule, but I could also see `Timer::just_finished` continuing to make sense with `just_` being its own category of predicate naming similar to names like `has_` or `must_`.\n\nI've left the \"ready for implementation\" tag off until some bike shedding can happen on item 3.","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19110/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
