Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #14708\r\n\r\nAlso fixes some commands not updating tracked location.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n`ObserverTrigger` has a new `caller` field with the `track_change_detection` feature;\r\nhooks take an additional caller parameter (which is `Some(…)` or `None` depending on the feature).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nSee the new tests in `src/observer/mod.rs`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\nObservers now know from where they were triggered (if `track_change_detection` is enabled):\r\n```rust\r\nworld.observe(move |trigger: Trigger<OnAdd, Foo>| {\r\n    println!(\"Added Foo from {}\", trigger.caller());\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Migration\r\n\r\n- hooks now take an additional `Option<&'static Location>`
