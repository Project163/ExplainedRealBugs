Objective\r\n\r\n- ECS error handling is a lovely flagship feature for Bevy 0.16, all in the name of reducing panics and encouraging better error handling (#14275).\r\n- Currently though, command and system error handling are completely disjoint and use different mechanisms.\r\n- Additionally, there's a number of distinct ways to set the default/fallback/global error handler that have limited value. As far as I can tell, this will be cfg flagged to toggle between dev and production builds in 99.9% of cases, with no real value in more granular settings or helpers.\r\n- Fixes #17272\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Standardize error handling on the OnceLock global error mechanisms ironed out in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/17215\r\n   - As discussed there, there are serious performance concerns there, especially for commands\r\n   - I also think this is a better fit for the use cases, as it's truly global\r\n- Move from `SystemErrorContext` to a more general purpose `ErrorContext`, which can handle observers and commands more clearly\r\n- Cut the superfluous setter methods on `App` and `SubApp`\r\n- Rename the limited (and unhelpful) `fallible_systems` example to `error_handling`, and add an example of command error handling\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nRan the `error_handling` example.\r\n\r\n## Notes for reviewers\r\n\r\n- Do you see a clear way to allow commands to retain &mut World access in the per-command custom error handlers? IMO that's a key feature here (allowing the ad-hoc creation of custom commands), but I'm not sure how to get there without exploding complexity.\r\n- I've removed the feature gate on the default_error_handler: contrary to @cart's opinion in #17215 I think that virtually all apps will want to use this. Can you think of a category of app that a) is extremely performance sensitive b) is fine with shipping to production with the panic error handler? If so, I can try to gather performance numbers and/or reintroduce the feature flag. UPDATE: see benches at the end of this message.\r\n- ~~`OnceLock` is in `std`: @bushrat011899 what should we do here?~~\r\n- Do you have ideas for more automated tests for this collection of features?\r\n\r\n## Benchmarks\r\n\r\nI checked the impact of the feature flag introduced: benchmarks might show regressions. This bears more investigation. I'm still skeptical that there are users who are well-served by a fast always panicking approach, but I'm going to re-add the feature flag here to avoid stalling this out.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/237f644a-b36d-4332-9b45-76fd5cbff4d0)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18351/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16845278418,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86lo3qvzwAAAAPsDozS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16845278418","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5d0505a85e14d662a85dd4805cda3884318388bb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/5d0505a85e14d662a85dd4805cda3884318388bb","created_at":"2025-03-18T19:47:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16845278640,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86lo3qvzwAAAAPsDo2w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16845278640","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-18T19:47:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16847070406,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86lo3qvzwAAAAPsKeTG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16847070406","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"27d02de375cd4ccbdd43656bd21e6b2f060bd51d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/27d02de375cd4ccbdd43656bd21e6b2f060bd51d","created_at":"2025-03-18T20:18:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
