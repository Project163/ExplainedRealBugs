These latter two however hurt parallization when queried. If one does that only to get `EntityLocation`, that restriction is needless as the location alone does not require further access to the component data.\r\nIt would make sense to offer this type as a `QueryData` that can also be freely added to a query with `Query::transmute_lense`.\r\n\r\n## What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nI have no personal use case, I just noticed that when looking through the docs to answer someone's question, what else than components can be queried. If someone can come up with an actual use case, please share it in this issue.","closed_by":{"login":"james7132","id":3137680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzc2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132","html_url":"https://github.com/james7132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
