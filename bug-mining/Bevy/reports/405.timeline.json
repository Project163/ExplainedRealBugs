Objective\r\nCurrently the resource doesn't get dropped if thread panics. This is presumably to prevent !SEND resource from being dropped by wrong thread.\r\nBut, this logic is not needed for SEND resources. So we don't need this check for SEND resource.\r\n\r\nFixes #15144 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nWe check if resource is !SEND before, validating that correct thread is dropping the resource.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Did you test these changes? If so, how?\r\nI did run cargo test on bevy.\r\n- Are there any parts that need more testing?\r\nNo\r\n- How can other people (reviewers) test your changes? Is there anything specific they need to know?\r\nNothing special\r\n- If relevant, what platforms did you test these changes on, and are there any important ones you can't test?\r\nx86_64 desktop","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14282388399,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86WBi9RzwAAAANTS_Ov","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14282388399","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c2d54f5f0449858dc984f498444bf9afd017a786","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/c2d54f5f0449858dc984f498444bf9afd017a786","created_at":"2024-09-16T23:53:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14282388509,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86WBi9RzwAAAANTS_Qd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14282388509","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-16T23:53:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
