We now have the ability to set the watcher activity via a feature or override it. If we don't override it, there is currently no way for a plugin to read whether we are in hot-reloading mode or not. My plugin however would like to know this, since I modify some resources on disk. If hot reloading is *not* enabled, my plugin needs to sync the in-memory resources as well, since they will not be automatically reloaded.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nExpose a boolean somewhere that tells us whether hot reloading is on or off.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nJust don't. In my case, my plugin could just force the user to activate hot reloading on supported platforms.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThis came up while [updating Yarn Slinger to Bevy 0.12](https://github.com/yarn-slinger/yarn-slinger/pull/164)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
