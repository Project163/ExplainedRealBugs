Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #18397\r\n- Simplify feature-gating in `bevy`\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Update to Glam 0.30.1 which includes a new [`nostd-libm`](https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs/pull/617) feature\r\n- Expose and offer a similar feature in `bevy_math`\r\n- Enable `bevy_math/nostd-libm` in `bevy_internal`\r\n- Remove feature gates on `bevy_math`, `bevy_transform`, and `bevy_input` in `bevy_internal` (reverting to pre-0.16 behaviour)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- CI\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nThis causes `bevy` to always include `libm` as a dependency, but it is a very small and high quality one from the Rust language team themselves. Crucially, the `libm` and `std` features can both override the use of `nostd-libm`, still giving users total control over which implementation they wish to use in both Glam and `bevy_math`. I believe the singular forced dependency is worth it for the increased functionality that `default-features = false` Bevy can provide.\r\n\r\nFor users who cannot accept that dependency, you can depend directly on Bevy's sub-crates instead, which is generally recommended for enthusiast users anyway.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-31T02:47:04Z","updated_at":"2025-03-31T02:47:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18638","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18638/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18638/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18638/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18638","id":2959337081,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86Qt1Hh","number":18638,"title":"Upgrade to Glam 0.29.3 and Simplify Feature Gating","user":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2272067174,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjcyMDY3MTc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Dependencies","name":"C-Dependencies","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A change to the crates that Bevy depends on"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Considering `libm` is an official Rust crate, it's a very low-risk dependency to unconditionally include.\r\n- For users who do not want `libm` included, simply import Bevy's subcrates directly, since `bevy_math/nostd-libm` will not be enabled.\r\n- I know we are _very_ late in the RC cycle for 0.16, but this has a substantial impact on the usability of `bevy` that I consider worth including.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18638/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17062723091,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86ul6TrzwAAAAP5BH4T","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17062723091","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"45e2398b5114697f1592df954d20ecf96c625ee4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/45e2398b5114697f1592df954d20ecf96c625ee4","created_at":"2025-03-31T19:23:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17062723348,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86ul6TrzwAAAAP5BH8U","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17062723348","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-31T19:23:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17063637566,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86ul6TrzwAAAAP5EnI-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17063637566","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a2b14983f48cbfd82b5b44d7930014a9432fb2b3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/a2b14983f48cbfd82b5b44d7930014a9432fb2b3","created_at":"2025-03-31T20:36:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
