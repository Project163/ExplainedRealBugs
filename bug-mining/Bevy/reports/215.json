Bevy version\r\n\r\n0.13\r\n\r\n## Relevant system information\r\n\r\n```ignore\r\n`AdapterInfo { name: \"NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970\", vendor: 4318, device: 5058, device_type: DiscreteGpu, driver: \"NVIDIA\", driver_info: \"550.67\", backend: Vulkan }`\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What you did\r\n\r\nLoad a gltf (glb) scene using materials for bloom effect, and using KHR_materials_emissive_strength extension (supported since 0.12: #9553 )\r\nSpecifically the glb file used for this test: \r\nhttps://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/main/2.0/EmissiveStrengthTest\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\n- what were you expecting?\r\n**Bloom shall be displayed properly, as showed in the previous link**\r\n\r\n- what actually happened?\r\n**No bloom at all**\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nSeems to be a regression since 0.12 as it worked properly initially:\r\n\r\nFrom **v0.12.0**\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/31958866/d1dcef72-c222-46a7-8f28-b569424365a4)\r\n\r\n\r\n**From v0.13.0**\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/31958866/14b58a25-e91a-4367-933a-02e20bdb8ef0)\r\n\r\nEdit : if the background seems brighter for v0.13 it's because the code uses the default exposure, which changed for this version, but as far as I can tell, this as no direct relation with the bloom issue (I tested the different const exposure values from the API)\r\n\r\nEdit 2: minimal code to reproduce the issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse bevy::{core_pipeline::bloom::BloomSettings, prelude::*};\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    App::new()\r\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\r\n        .add_systems(Startup, setup)\r\n        .run();\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands, asset_server: Res<AssetServer>) {\r\n    commands.spawn((\r\n        Camera3dBundle {\r\n            camera: Camera {\r\n                hdr: true,\r\n                ..default()\r\n            },\r\n            transform: Transform::from_xyz(0.0, 6., 12.0)\r\n                .looking_at(Vec3::new(0., 1., 0.), Vec3::Y),\r\n            ..default()\r\n        },\r\n        BloomSettings::default(),\r\n    ));\r\n\r\n    commands.spawn((SceneBundle {\r\n        scene: asset_server.load(\"EmissiveStrengthTest.glb#Scene0\"),\r\n        ..default()\r\n    },));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
