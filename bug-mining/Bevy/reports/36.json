My use case is an SDF-based material, where the UVs are insufficient to build the SDF.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nAdd the node's size to vertex information being sent to the vertex shader, and propagate it in the default vertex shader and in `UiVertexOutput`.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\n- I have tried having a material per node and manually updating the size of each node in the materials each frame, but this is difficult to coordinate correctly and also leads to poor performance due to the number of materials.\r\n- To build an SDF shader, world-space position + UVs + node size is sufficient, and so is world-space position + UVs + world-space node center, but I think it makes the most sense to pass in the size of the node.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'd be willing to submit a PR if needed.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
