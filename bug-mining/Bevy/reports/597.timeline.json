about this, I think part of my answer is in my question 🤡 since I found the `entity_sync_system()` is called right before extract, so the sentence in the docs \"at the very beginning of the frame\" is misleading (should read \"of the _render_ frame\"), but indeed the entities are sync'ed once you start extraction and after the main world ticked.\n\nFor the requirements, I forgot to mention that several components on the render entity contain references to GPU resources, so I need a hook to read those _before_ the entity and its components are despawned. Otherwise I will have GPU memory leaks. I didn't look into the observers API; maybe there's a way to do that?\n\nAs for the minimal non-breaking solution, I think adding the ability to inject a custom pre-extract system via _e.g._
