These vulnerabilities correspond to four distinct safe APIs in the crate, each exposing unsound and vulnerable behavior due to incorrect usage of unsafe code internally.\n      \n      Unfortunately, the maintainer doesn't have much availability to resolve these issues so there's no concrete timeline for fixes. Community contributions towards fixing these vulnerabilities would be much appreciated.\n    ├ Announcement: https://github.com/LiquidityC/slice_ring_buffer/issues/12\n    ├ Solution: No safe upgrade is available!\n    ├ slice-ring-buffer v0.3.4\n      └── minimp3_fixed v0.5.4\n          └── rodio v0.20.1\n              └── bevy_audio v0.17.0-dev\n                  └── bevy_internal v0.17.0-dev\n                      ├── bevy v0.17.0-dev\n                      └── bevy_dylib v0.17.0-dev\n                          └── bevy v0.17.0-dev (*)\n\nadvisories FAILED\n```\n\nThis is coming in through `rodio`, our audio crate. \n\nThere are a few possible ways to resolve this:\n\n1. `rodio` might be swapping to `symphonia`\n2. We could swap to `firewheel`, which already uses `symphonia\n3. We could work upstream to help out the maintainer and fix this.\n4. We could ignore this vulnerability, ideally after checking if it affects us.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
