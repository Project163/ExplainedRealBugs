Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #16339\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Replaced `component_reads_and_writes` and `component_writes` with `try_iter_component_access`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Ran `dynamic` example to confirm behaviour is unchanged.\r\n- CI\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThe following methods (some removed in previous PRs) are now replaced by `Access::try_iter_component_access`:\r\n\r\n* `Access::component_reads_and_writes`\r\n* `Access::component_reads`\r\n* `Access::component_writes`\r\n\r\nAs `try_iter_component_access` returns a `Result`, you'll now need to handle the failing case (e.g., `unwrap()`). There is currently a single failure mode, `UnboundedAccess`, which occurs when the `Access` is for all `Components` _except_ certain exclusions. Since this list is infinite, there is no meaningful way for `Access` to provide an iterator. Instead, get a list of components (e.g., from the `Components` structure) and iterate over that instead, filtering using `Access::has_component_read`, `Access::has_component_write`, etc.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you'll need to `filter_map` the accesses based on which method you're attempting to replace:\r\n\r\n* `Access::component_reads_and_writes` -> `Exclusive(_) | Shared(_)`\r\n* `Access::component_reads` -> `Shared(_)`\r\n* `Access::component_writes` -> `Exclusive(_)`\r\n\r\nTo ease migration, please consider the below extension trait which you can include in your project:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait AccessCompatibilityExt {\r\n    /// Returns the indices of the components this has access to.\r\n    fn component_reads_and_writes(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = T> + '_;\r\n\r\n    /// Returns the indices of the components this has non-exclusive access to.\r\n    fn component_reads(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = T> + '_;\r\n\r\n    /// Returns the indices of the components this has exclusive access to.\r\n    fn component_writes(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = T> + '_;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<T: SparseSetIndex> AccessCompatibilityExt for Access<T> {\r\n    fn component_reads_and_writes(&self) -> impl Iterator<Item = T> + '_ {\r\n        self\r\n            .try_iter_component_access()\r\n            .expect(\"Access is unbounded.

You should consider using these as a starting point for a more appropriate migration based on your specific needs.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n- This new method is fallible based on whether the `Access` is bounded or unbounded (unbounded occurring with inverted component sets). If bounded, will return an iterator of every item and its access level. I believe this makes sense without exposing implementation details around `Access`.\r\n- The access level is defined by an `enum` `ComponentAccessKind<T>`, either `Archetypical`, `Shared`, or `Exclusive`. As a convenience, this `enum` has a method `index` to get the inner `T` value without a match statement. It does add more code, but the API is clearer.\r\n- Within `QueryBuilder` this new method simplifies several pieces of logic without changing behaviour.\r\n- Within `QueryState` the logic is simplified and the amount of iteration is reduced, potentially improving performance.\r\n- Within the `dynamic` example it has identical behaviour, with the inversion footgun explicitly highlighted by an `unwrap`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16348/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2467610998","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16339#issuecomment-2467610998","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16339","id":2467610998,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86TFMF2","user":{"login":"SkiFire13","id":9020423,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjA0MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9020423?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13","html_url":"https://github.com/SkiFire13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SkiFire13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-11T09:10:28Z","updated_at":"2024-11-11T09:10:28Z","body":"Note that the `dynamic` example was kinda broken before as well, as it didn't support the case where entity can access all components.\n\nShort term I think the `enum` approach is the best one, but long term I agree with @pcwalton that this is an abuse of `Access` and shouldn't be exposed like this.

But exposing how the set is defined (i.e. by inclusion or exclusion of some element) exposes implementation details.\n\nAh, is your worry that we'll introduce new kinds of infinite sets that can't be expressed that way?  Like, I can imagine a future \"this reads any component that implements a specific trait\" access.  (I'd consider adding those to be an API change rather than an implementation detail change, but it's a compatibility hazard either way.)  \n\nDoes @bushrat011899's approach in #16348 alleviate that concern?  All infinite sets are collapsed in a single `Err(UnboundedAccess)` variant, which should allow any possible set to be expressed.
