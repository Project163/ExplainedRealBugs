Objective\r\n\r\n- Our benchmarks and `compile_fail` tests lag behind the rest of the engine because they are not in the Cargo workspace, so not checked by CI.\r\n- Fixes #16801, please see it for further context!\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Add benchmarks and `compile_fail` tests to the Cargo workspace.\r\n- Fix any leftover formatting issues and documentation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- I think CI should catch most things!\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Outdated issue I was having with function reflection being optional</summary>\r\n\r\nThe `reflection_types` example is failing in Rust-Analyzer for me, but not a normal check.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nerror[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `ReflectRef::Function(_)` not covered\r\n   --> examples/reflection/reflection_types.rs:81:11\r\n    |\r\n81  |     match value.reflect_ref() {\r\n    |           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ pattern `ReflectRef::Function(_)` not covered\r\n    |\r\nnote:

is because the following line is feature-gated:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/cc0f6a8db43581755bd84302072c7b97ea51bc0f/examples/reflection/reflection_types.rs#L117-L122\r\n\r\nMy theory for why this is happening is because the benchmarks enabled `bevy_reflect`'s `function` feature, which gets merged with the rest of the features when RA checks the workspace, but the `#[cfg(...)]` gate in the example isn't detecting it:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/cc0f6a8db43581755bd84302072c7b97ea51bc0f/benches/Cargo.toml#L19\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on how to fix this? It's not blocking, since the example still compiles as normal, but it's just RA and the command `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` appears to fail.\r\n\r\n</summary>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16858/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15740422417,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86jN-EHzwAAAAOqM8kR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15740422417","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"20277006ce318b4cdcf264579c2a6c126f67bc9f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/20277006ce318b4cdcf264579c2a6c126f67bc9f","created_at":"2024-12-21T22:47:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15740422454,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86jN-EHzwAAAAOqM8k2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15740422454","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-21T22:48:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15830459944,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86jN-EHzwAAAAOvkaYo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15830459944","actor":{"login":"ecoskey","id":56370779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MzcwNzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56370779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey","html_url":"https://github.com/ecoskey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"942086ae2915fc6b85bcf555c8147c9a1457f404","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ecoskey/bevy/commits/942086ae2915fc6b85bcf555c8147c9a1457f404","created_at":"2025-01-06T20:11:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15830460227,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86jN-EHzwAAAAOvkadD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15830460227","actor":{"login":"ecoskey","id":56370779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MzcwNzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56370779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey","html_url":"https://github.com/ecoskey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecoskey/followers","follo
