Honestly, I have no idea if this is desired/useful, but I could probably just implement it in this PR if that's the case.\r\n\r\n#12211 added a gizmo for rendering the XYZ axes relative to a `Transform` (or `impl TransformPoint`). This is useful for 3D, but it'd also be useful to be able to draw just the XY axes in 2D. The 3D gizmo wouldn't look quite correct in 2D, and most other gizmo methods already have 2D variants.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nAdd an `axes_2d` method that renders the XY axes.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nLeave it up to the user, or use `axes` in 2D as well. It'd just look weird in 2D, because the arrows are 3D, and the Z arrow would probably look like a cross in the middle.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12222/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12222/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
