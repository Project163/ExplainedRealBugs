If we do this we should make sure to re-open #14883 so we don't forget to re-evaluate the issue @Luminoth is facing :)\r\n\r\nThe issue he is facing is something that has been solved in `sickle_ui` by inverting the dependency and anyone can take the abstraction from it. It is a limitation of `ChildBuilder` to begin with, since that doesn't let you take its commands for fancy chains. It is also not relevant since an `Entity` can be captured by a variable outside of closures and new commands can be issues on the next line.\r\n\r\nThere _are_ situations that cannot be resolved per se, which is again the reason `sickle_ui` has the abstraction (and I think `.reborrow` already solves those cases without it). Also, I somehow feel that his example won't be resolved by making it consume self. Just makes commands entangled with the closure, making it even less workable in a larger code block.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I am fine to leave it as-is, just worried about the astronomical impact for ??? gains. I mean if it would bring performance benefits or enable something mission critical we couldn't do before, yeah why not...\r\n\r\nEdit: `.insert_if` is welcome to stay tho.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2381393425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eidloi","id":20684057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjg0MDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20684057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi","html_url":"https://github.com/eidloi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eidloi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14445527957,"node_id":"MEE_lADODf6-U86YSOJHzwAAAANdBUOV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14445527957","actor":{"login":"Luminoth","id":3094168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTQxNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3094168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth","html_url":"https://github.com/Luminoth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-29T15:11:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14445527963,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U86YSOJHzwAAAANdBUOb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14445527963","actor":{"login":"Luminoth","id":3094168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTQxNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3094168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth","html_url":"https://github.com/Luminoth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luminoth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-29T15:11:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14445575533,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86YSOJHzwAAAANdBf1t","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14445575533","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-29T15:33:18Z","label":{"name":"X-Controversial","color":"D93F0B"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14445575539,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86YSOJHzwAAAA
