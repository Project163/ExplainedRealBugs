Objective\r\n\r\n- Simplifies/clarifies the winit loop.\r\n- Fixes #12612.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe Winit loop runs following this flow:\r\n* NewEvents\r\n* Any number of other events, that can be 0, including RequestRedraw\r\n* AboutToWait\r\n\r\nBevy also uses the UpdateMode, to define how the next loop has to run. It can be essentially:\r\n* Continuous, using ControlFlow::Wait for windowed apps, and ControlFlow::Poll for windowless apps\r\n* Reactive/ReactiveLowPower, using ControlFlow::WaitUntil with a specific wait delay\r\n\r\nThe changes are made to follow this pattern, so that \r\n* NewEvents define if the WaitUntil has been canceled because we received a Winit event.\r\n* AboutToWait:\r\n  * checks if the window has to be redrawn\r\n  * otherwise calls app.update() if the WaitUntil timeout has elapsed\r\n  * updates the ControlFlow accordingly\r\n\r\nTo make the code more logical:\r\n* AboutToWait checks if any Bevy's RequestRedraw event has been emitted\r\n* create_windows is run every cycle, at the beginning of the loop\r\n* the ActiveState (that could be renamed ActivityState) is updated in AboutToWait, symmetrically for WillSuspend/WillResume\r\n* the AppExit events are checked every loop cycle, to exit the app early\r\n\r\n## Platform-specific testing\r\n\r\n- [x]
