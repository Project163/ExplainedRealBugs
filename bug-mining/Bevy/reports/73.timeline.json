Objective\r\nFix #11845.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nRemove the `UpdateAssets` and `AssetEvents` schedules. Moved the `UpdateAssets` systems to `PreUpdate`, and `AssetEvents` systems into `First`. The former is meant to run before any of the event flushes.\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\nIt'd be ideal if we could manually flush the events for assets to avoid needing two, sort of redundant, systems. This should at least let them potentially run in parallel with all of the systems in the schedules they were moved to.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\nRemoved: `UpdateAssets` schedule from the main schedule. All systems have been moved to `PreUpdate`.\r\nRemoved: `AssetEvents` schedule from the main schedule. All systems have been move to `First` with the same system sets.\r\n\r\n## Migration

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\nAfter #11845, `handle_internal_asset_events`, an exclusive system, was moved to `PreUpdate`, however, due to it's ordering constraint, all of the `TrackAssets` events cannot start until it's done. However, the exclusive system conflicts with every other system that is topologically sorted before it, so it can't start until all of them are finished. Even though there is no strict ordering constraint between the exclusive system and the systems running before it, it will prevent these two groups of systems from running in parallel with each other, which may have a performance cost.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/3137680/cf921f5d-c446-4f38-9a83-b9b37e1dba1e)\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\nChange the topological sort on a schedule's system to maximize the number of systems that can parallelize together by forcing exclusive systems apart as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThis was already done for `apply_deferred`, perhaps the same logic can be applied to other exclusive systems as well?\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\nLeaving it as is.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
