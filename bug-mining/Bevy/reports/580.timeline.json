https://github.com/musjj/camera_texture_bug. The bug is also visible in the official example: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/release-0.15.0/examples/2d/pixel_grid_snap.rs, but it's less noticeable due to all the movement.\n\nRun the application with `cargo run` and resize the window a little bit.\n\n## What went wrong\n\nWhen the scene is rendered to a texture, artifacting occurs on certain window sizes, despite the zoom of the camera and the size of the texture being unchanged. \n\nNote that the scale factor is *pixel-perfect*, so there shouldn't be any artifacting happening.\n\n## Additional

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #16773\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15969 introduces a regression that causes image tearing when `ImageFilterMode::Nearest` is used as the sampler. Rounding the origin fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nCredits to @sophrosyne97 for bisecting and finding the commit that broke it.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nYou can test it with this repository: https://github.com/musjj/nearest_filter_bug\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/musjj/nearest_filter_bug\r\ncd nearest_filter_bug\r\necho '[patch.crates-io]\\nbevy = { git = \"https://github.com/musjj/bevy.git\", branch = \"rounding-bug\" }' >>Cargo.toml\r\nsed -i -e 's/0.15.0/0.15.0-dev/' Cargo.toml\r\ncargo update && cargo run\r\n```\r\nGradually resize the window to various sizes, while paying attention to the sprite and font. No tearing should occur on any window resolution, even on odd numbers.\r\n\r\nTested on Linux with Gnome. Tests on other platforms would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n##
