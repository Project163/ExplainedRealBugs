was sort of left out on purpose: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11431#issuecomment-1904776945\r\n\r\nIt seems a bit strange to me to support flipping a texture in a mesh representation. I feel like it's something that should instead be configurable at a material-level. I would assume that this is possible already? If not, I think it'd be valuable to have.\r\n\r\nOnly supporting texture flipping for `Rectangle`/`Quad` also seems slightly arbitrary to me; why not also support planes? Or circles? Or basically any shape?\r\n\r\nLooking at other applications, I'm also not seeing a similar `flip` property elsewhere. For example, [Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_quadmesh.html) doesn't have it (I also checked editor GUI), Unity doesn't have it, and Blender doesn't have it. To me, it doesn't feel like a quad-specific property, but a general material
