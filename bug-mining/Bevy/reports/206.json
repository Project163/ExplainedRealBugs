What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nIf #12212 is closed as won't fix, the developer experience of working with our assorted fields is much worse than it needs to be.\r\n\r\nRather than simply being able to call:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n*color = color.lighten(0.2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nthey must write\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet hsla = Hsla::from(color);\r\nlet light_hsla = hsla.lighten(0.2);\r\n*color = Color::from(light_hsla);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nIf an operation is supported in the supplied color space, call the corresponding method.\r\n\r\nIf it is not, convert to the most reasonable color space for that operation (usually Oklaba), perform the operation, and then convert back.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nWe could choose a single opinionated perceptual color space for working with all parts of UI code.\r\n\r\nThis is limiting, and particularly painful since it would force const definitions for palettes to be done directly in that color space. This isn't feasible because of limitations on const float arithmetic and const traits.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13214/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
