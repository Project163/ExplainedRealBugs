Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #14698\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Refactor all the `SceneSpawner` functions to include a `_dynamic` suffix where appropriate.\r\n- Add non-DynamicScene versions of functions on `SceneSpawner`.\r\n- Listen for `Scene` `AssetEvent`s and update the corresponding spawned scenes.\r\n- Despawn scenes before respawning them.\r\n- Store the parent of a scene in its `InstanceInfo`, so that we know where to parent the new entities from a hot-reloaded scene.\r\n- Make `InstanceInfo` private (none of our APIs returned it anyway).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- Ran the `hot_asset_reloading` example and mutated the GLTF to see it be updated. It works!
