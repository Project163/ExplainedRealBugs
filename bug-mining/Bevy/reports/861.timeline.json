Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #19403\r\nAs described in the issue, the objective is to support the use of systems returning `Result<(), BevyError>` and \r\n`Result<bool, BevyError>` as run conditions. In these cases, the run condition would hold on `Ok(())` and `Ok(true)` respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n`IntoSystem<In, bool, M>` cannot be implemented for systems returning `Result<(), BevyError>` and `Result<bool, BevyError>` as that would conflict with their trivial implementation of the trait. That led me to add a method to the sealed trait `SystemCondition` that does the conversion. In the original case of a system returning `bool`, the system is returned as is. With the new types, the system is combined with `map()` to obtain a `bool`.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I'm confused as to why `SystemCondition` has a generic `In` parameter as it is only ever used with `In = ()` as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI added a simple test for both type of system. That's minimal but it felt enough. I could not picture the more complicated tests passing for a run condition returning `bool` and failing for the new types.\r\n\r\n## Doc\r\n\r\nI documenting the change on the page of the trait. I had trouble wording it right but I'm not sure how to improve it. The phrasing \"the condition returns `true`\" which reads naturally is now technically incorrect as the new types return a `Result`. However, the underlying condition system that the implementing system turns into does indeed return `bool`. But talking about the implementation details felt too much. Another possibility is to use another turn of phrase like \"the condition holds\" or \"the condition checks out\". I've left \"the condition returns `true`\" in the documentation of `run_if` and the provided methods for now.\r\n\r\nI'm perplexed about the examples. In the first one, why not implement the condition directly instead of having a system returning it? Is it from a time of Bevy where you had to implement your conditions that way? In that case maybe that should be updated. And in the second example I'm missing the point entirely. As I stated above, I've only seen conditions used in contexts where they have no input parameter. Here we create a condition with an input parameter (cannot be used by `run_if`) and we are using it with `pipe()` which actually doesn't need our system to implement `SystemCondition`. Both examples are also calling `IntoSystem::into_system` which should not be encouraged. What am I missing?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19553/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18064870204,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U864fI0BzwAAAAQ0wAs8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18064870204","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0e805eb49c89cf7ff8ff047fe5e3bff2f2352b8b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/0e805eb49c89cf7ff8ff047fe5e3bff2f2352b8b","created_at":"2025-06-10T00:24:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18064870376,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U864fI0BzwAAAAQ0wAvo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18064870376","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-10T00:24:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"chescock","id":8494645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0OTQ2NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8494645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock","html_url":"https://github.com/chescock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-23T15:01:21Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T15:01:21Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19145","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19145/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19145/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19145/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/19145","id":3052518337,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86VmwJm","number":19145,"title":"Have

Objective\r\n\r\nAllow combinator and pipe systems to delay validation of the second system, while still allowing the second system to be skipped.  \r\n\r\nFixes #18796\r\n\r\nAllow fallible systems to be used as one-shot systems, reporting errors to the error handler when used through commands.  \r\n\r\nFixes #19722\r\n\r\nAllow fallible systems to be used as run conditions, including when used with combinators.  Alternative to #19580.\r\n\r\nAlways validate parameters when calling the safe `run_without_applying_deferred`, `run`, and `run_readonly` methods on a `System`.  \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nHave `System::run_unsafe` return a `Result`.  \r\n\r\nWe want pipe systems to run the first system before validating the second, since the first system may affect whether the second system has valid parameters.  But if the second system skips then we have no output value to return!  So, pipe systems must return a `Result` that indicates whether the second system ran.  \r\n\r\nBut if we just make pipe systems have `Out = Result<B::Out>`, then chaining `a.pipe(b).pipe(c)` becomes difficult.  `c` would need to accept the `Result` from `a.pipe(b)`, which means it would likely need to return `Result` itself, giving `Result<Result<Out>>`!  \r\n\r\nInstead, we make *all* systems return a `Result`!  We move the handling of fallible systems from `IntoScheduleConfigs` and `IntoObserverSystem` to `SystemParamFunction` and `ExclusiveSystemParamFunction`, so that an infallible system can be wrapped before being passed to a combinator.  \r\n\r\nAs a side effect, this enables fallible systems to be used as run conditions and one-shot systems.  \r\n\r\nNow that the safe `run_without_applying_deferred`, `run`, and `run_readonly` methods return a `Result`, we can have them perform parameter validation themselves instead of requiring each caller to remember to call them.  `run_unsafe` will continue to not validate parameters, since it is used in the multi-threaded executor when we want to validate and run in separate tasks.\r\n\r\nNote that this makes type inference a little more brittle.  A function that returns `Result<T>` can be considered either a fallible system returning `T` or an infallible system returning `Result<T>` (and this is important to continue supporting `pipe`-based error handling)!  So there are some cases where the output type of a system can no longer be inferred.  It will work fine when directly adding to a schedule, since then the output type is fixed to `()` (or `bool` for run conditions).  And it will work fine when `pipe`ing to a system with a typed input parameter.\r\n\r\nI used a dedicated `RunSystemError` for the error type instead of plain `BevyError` so that skipping a system does not box an error or capture a backtrace.  \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19145/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
