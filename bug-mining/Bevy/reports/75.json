0.13\r\n\r\nNote before reading the issue: Reflection are still obscure to me and I might have misunderstood the reason my use case no longer works.\r\n\r\nI upgraded my project from Bevy 0.12 to bevy 0.13, and I extensively use the crate bevy inspector egui to check my project.\r\nOne of the things I do is to register the states I use in the reflection system via this kind of code: ```app.init_state::<S>.register_type::<State<S>>.register_type::<NextState<S>>;``` and this used to make me able to check the current state and manually triggering a state transition via bevy inspector egui.\r\n\r\nIn bevy 0.13, due to this commit: https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/ba0f8f996f04ea7d2d25e3004cf0cb3ac7c9015b (file: crates/bevy_ecs/src/schedule/state.rs, line: 77), `State<S>` no longer reflects Resource or Debug, breaking this behavior.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to make `State<S>` reflect resource even without deriving
