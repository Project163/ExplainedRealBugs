This is to improve compile times, binary size, and runtime efficiently.\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\nI expected this would be easy, but I use the third-party crate `bevy_vector_shapes` which relies on the enum `AlphaMode` from `bevy_pbr`.\r\n\r\nI would have submitted a PR to remove the dependency, but it's nontrivial to do because of this need for alpha blending support. So now my project is running a full 3D render pipeline just because it wants a semitransparent square.\r\n\r\nGiven that alpha blending is useful in rendering in any number of dimensions, this is a bevy issue and will likely be encountered in other crates.\r\n\r\nThe enum should most likely be moved to `bevy_render`, where most types common to 2d and 3d rendering are located.","closed_by":{"login":"james7132","id":3137680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzc2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132","html_url":"https://github.com/james7132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11985/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
