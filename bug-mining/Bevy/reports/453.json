I was commenting purely on methods now consuming `self`. I realize now that I wasn't clear about that in my earlier comments, sorry about that\r\n\r\nWithin the changes in this PR I counted 6 cases where the change to consuming `self` enabled chaining.\r\nOn the other hand I counted 15 instances where doing re-assignment (`entity_commands = entity_commands.XXX()`) was now necessary.\r\n\r\nIMO, that's not looking great.\r\n\r\n> I'd like to keep the API in place for the RC, see how the ecosystem at large reacts to it\r\n\r\nRight, we do have release candidates now. That does ease my worries a bit.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @tim-blackbird in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14897#issuecomment-2381336342_\r\n            ","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15521/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15521/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
