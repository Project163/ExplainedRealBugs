Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #19029 (also maybe sorta #18002, but we may want to handle the SPA issue I outlined there more gracefully?)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe most minimal / surgical approach I could think of, hopefully cherry-pickable for a point release.\r\n\r\nIt seems that it's not *entirely* crazy for web services to return 403 for an item that was not found. Here's an example from [Amazon CloudFront docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/http-403-permission-denied.html#s3-origin-403-error). If it is somewhat common for web services to behave this way, then I think it's best to also treat these responses as if they were \"not found.\"\r\n\r\nI was previously of the opinion that any 400 level error \"might as well\" get this treatment, but I'm now thinking that's probably overkill and there are quite a few 400 level statuses that would indicate some problem that needs to be fixed, and interpreting these as \"not found\" might add confusion to the debugging process.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTested this with a web server that returns 403 for requests to meta files.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncargo run -p build-wasm-example -- --api webgl2 sprite && \\\r\nopen \"http://localhost:4000\" && \\\r\npython3 test_403.py examples/wasm\r\n```\r\n`test_403.py`:\r\n```python\r\nfrom http.server import HTTPServer, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler\r\nimport os\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\n\r\nclass CustomHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):\r\n    def do_GET(self):\r\n        if self.path.endswith(\".meta\"):\r\n            self.send_response(403)\r\n            self.send_header(\"Content-type\", \"text/plain\")\r\n            self.end_headers()\r\n            self.wfile.write(b\"403 Forbidden: Testing.\\n\")\r\n        else:\r\n            super().do_GET()\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    if len(sys.argv) != 2:\r\n        print(f\"Usage: {sys.argv[0]} <directory>\")\r\n        sys.exit(1)\r\n\r\n    os.chdir(sys.argv[1])\r\n\r\n    server_address = (\"\", 4000)\r\n    httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, CustomHandler)\r\n    httpd.serve_forever()\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19268/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19268/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17891607631,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U860-SXczwAAAAQqbERP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17891607631","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0fca6938ea0e965c4faa7ef0394284573e973dfb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/0fca6938ea0e965c4faa7ef0394284573e973dfb","created_at":"2025-05-30T20:58:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17891607750,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U860-SXczwAAAAQqbETG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17891607750","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-05-30T20:58:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17891984760,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U860-SXczwAAAAQqcgV4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17891984760","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5bd89fdc697c70720e8ec919a42a42429d83de35","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/5bd89fdc697c70720e8ec919a42a42429d83de35","created_at":"2025-05-30T21:29:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17892207719,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U860-SXczwAAAAQqdWxn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/17892207719","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf
