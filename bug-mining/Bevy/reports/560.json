Could you elaborate? EDIT - By that, do you mean whether or not the sprite is visible due to alpha/invisible texels? I'll add docs for that.\r\n\r\nExactly. I think most users would expect fully transparent pixels to not be hittable. Might be something where the backend/component specifies a threshold, so any alpha below that value will be ignored. Doesn't need to be added right now, but would be nice to mention in the plugin docs.\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @aevyrie in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14757#issuecomment-2297442070_\r\n            \r\nWe can either add a whole new backend for this, or add a configuration option to the existing backend. Checking the alpha value of each pixel is more expensive but more intuitive and should be enabled by default with a way to toggle it off.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14929/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14929/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
