Passing `&my_primitive` is not allowed.\r\nThis is fine and barely noticeable for primitives that implement `Copy` but those that don't, like `Polygon<N>` or `BoxedPolyline`, need to be cloned every time they are drawn using gizmos (The `examples/math/render_primitives` avoids this by having all primitives be `const`).\r\n\r\n## Some solutions\r\nSince the `primitive_Nd` functions do not do anything that could not be done with `&my_primitive` as of now, they could just accept this as a parameter instead. \r\nThis would obviously cause existing code to be rewritten (`gizmos.primitive_2d(PRIMITIVE)` -> `gizmos.primitive_2d(&PRIMITIVE)`) which is rather annoying.\r\n\r\nWe could introduce a new trait akin to `GizmoRefPrimitiveNd<P: PrimitiveNd>` with a function `primitive_ref_Nd(primitive: &P, ...)` that accepts primitives by ref. `GizmoRefPrimitiveNd` could probably even be implemented automatically for primitives implementing `GizmoPrimitiveNd`.\r\n\r\nIf we allow `bevy_math` to be changed to fix this, we could implement `PrimitiveNd` for `&P` where P is some Primitive that does *not* implement `Copy`. This would allow implementing `GizmoPrimitiveNd<&P>`","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13427/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
