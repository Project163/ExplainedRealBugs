Perhaps there could also be other `try` methods implemented as well.\r\n\r\nI need this because I have a situation where I have 2 entities which are related. I'm using observer systems so that when one entity is despawned, the observer despawns the other. This will inevitably cause the warn message because one command will be applied first. \r\nI have got round this by doing:\r\n```rust\r\ncommands.add(move |world: &mut World| {\r\n    if let Some(e) = world.get_entity_mut(e) {\r\n        e.despawn_recursive();\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nUsing `try_despawn` would make this a lot nicer!","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14511/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
