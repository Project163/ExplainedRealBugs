.add_systems(Startup, startup)\r\n        .add_systems(Update, update)\r\n        .run();\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Component)]\r\nstruct Marker;\r\n\r\nfn startup(mut commands: Commands) {\r\n

With<Marker>>,\r\n    mut commands: Commands\r\n) {\r\n    for entity in &query {\r\n        commands.entity(entity).despawn();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n### What were you expecting?\r\n1. Entity with `Marker` component gets queued for despawning.\r\n2. Its observer runs and queues the spawning of a new entity.\r\n3. End result is the entity with `Marker` being despawned, and a new empty entity being spawned.\r\n4. App continues to run.\r\n### What actually happened?\r\n```\r\nthread 'main' panicked at F:\\packages\\cargo\\registry\\src\\index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f\\bevy_ecs-0.14.0\\src\\entity\\mod.rs:582:9:\r\nflush() needs to be called before this operation is legal\r\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\r\nEncountered a panic when applying buffers for system `flush_panic_repro::update`!\r\nEncountered a panic in system `bevy_app::main_schedule::Main::run_main`!\r\nerror: process didn't exit successfully: `target\\debug\\flush_panic_repro.exe` (exit code: 101)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\n#14300 runs into the same panic, but involves component hooks, `MapEntities`, and `DynamicScene`. I don't know enough about Bevy's internals to know if these are ultimately the same bug, or just coincidentally panic in the same spot.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIf just the `Marker` component is removed without despawning its entity, the observer still runs (as expected) but there is no panic:\r\n```rust\r\nfn update(\r\n    query: Query<Entity, With<Marker>>,\r\n    mut commands: Commands\r\n) {\r\n    for entity in &query {\r\n        commands.entity(entity).remove::<Marker>(); // Does NOT panic.\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n// Rest of code is unchanged.\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\nHere's what seems like the most relevant part of the panic backtrace:\r\n```\r\n2: bevy_ecs::entity::Entities::verify_flushed\r\n   at

Objective\r\n\r\n- Add a test case for #14300 \r\n\r\nFixes #14300\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n`SceneEntityMapper` relies on operations on `Entities` that require flushing in advance, such as `alloc` and `free`. Previously, it wasn't calling `world.flush_entities()` itself and relied on its caller having flushed beforehand. This wasn't an issue before observers and hooks were released, since entity reservation was happening at expected times. Now that hooks and observers are a thing, they can introduce a need to flush.\r\n\r\nWe have a few options:\r\n* Flush after each observer/hook run\r\n* Flush between each paired observer/hook and operation that requires a flush\r\n* Flush before operations requiring it\r\n\r\nThe first option for this case seemed trickier to reason about than I wanted, since it involved the `BundleInserter` and its `UnsafeWorldCell`, and the second is generally harder to track down. The third seemed the most straightforward and conventional, since we can see a flush occurring at the start of a number of `World` methods. Therefore, we're letting `SceneEntityMapper` be in charge of upholding its own invariants and calling `flush_entities` when it's created.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAdded a new test case modeled after #14300 \r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2369828349","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14300#issuecomment-2369828349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14300","id":2369828349,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86NQLX9","user":{"login":"jrobsonchase","id":1553581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTM1ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1553581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase","html_url":"https://github.com/jrobsonchase","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrobsonchase/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-24T00:18:17Z","updated_at":"2024-09-24T00:18:17Z","body":"Can confirm - this is almost identical to #14465.
