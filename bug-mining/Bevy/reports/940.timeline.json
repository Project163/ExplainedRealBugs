To expand on my discord thoughts: if you're asking \"which observer entity is handling this event\", you are likely an \"internals developer\" of some kind, not a normal game logic developer. We should have a nice friendly / snappy name for \"the entity the event was triggered on\" (ex: `trigger.entity()`, `trigger.target()`, `trigger.on()`). `trigger.entity()` is honestly my favorite. Its pretty unambiguously  \"the entity this event was triggered on\", and it is likely the first name normal users will look for. Iirc we invented the \"target\" term to appease the internals developers that considered `entity` ambiguous, but I don't think that will be true in practice.

Objective\r\n\r\nGetting access to the original target of an entity-event is really helpful when working with bubbled / propagated events.\r\n\r\n`bevy_picking` special-cases this, but users have requested this for all sorts of bubbled events.\r\n\r\nThe existing naming convention was also very confusing. Fixes https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17112, but also see #18982.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n1. Rename `ObserverTrigger::target` -> `current_target`.\r\n1. Store `original_target: Option<Entity>` in `ObserverTrigger`.\r\n1. Wire it up so this field gets set correctly.\r\n1. Remove the `target` field on the `Pointer` events from `bevy_picking`.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18710, which attempted the same thing. Thanks @emfax!\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI've modified an existing test to check that the entities returned during event bubbling / propagation are correct.\r\n\r\n## Notes to reviewers\r\n\r\nIt's a little weird / sad that you can no longer access this infromation via the buffered events for `Pointer`. That said, you already couldn't access any bubbled target. We should probably remove the `BufferedEvent` form of `Pointer` to reduce confusion and overhead, but I didn't want to do so here.\r\n\r\nObserver events can be trivially converted into buffered events (write an observer with an EventWriter), and I suspect that that is the better migration if you want the controllable timing or performance characteristics of buffered events for your specific use case.\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to not store this data at all (and not expose any methods) if propagation was disabled. That involves more trait shuffling, and I don't think we should do it here for reviewability.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19663/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18158819254,"node_id":"RTE_lADODf6-U863CbZ7zwAAAAQ6WZe2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18158819254","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-15T18:57:42Z","rename":{"from":"Observer trigger fields rework","to":"Rename observer entity methods and fields"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18158819548,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U863CbZ7zwAAAAQ6WZjc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18158819548","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-15T18:57:48Z","label":{"name":"X-Controversial","color":"D93F0B"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2974593151","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19263#issuecomment-2974593151","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/19263","id":2974593151,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86xTLB_","user":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-15T18:58:28Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T18:58:28Z","body":"@viridia suggests:\n\n> Naming: I suggested the named \"listener\" (to refer to the current target) and \"emitter\" (to refer to the original target).

Note that \"listener\" used this way is consistent with the original bevy_eventlistener, while the term \"emitter\" is my own.\n\nThis worked in `bevy_eventlistener`, because `On` (the event listener) was stored on the actual entity that you want to attach the event handler for. However, in upstream Bevy, observers tend to be their own standalone entities. The *observer* is the listener, while the target is purely the entity the event was targeted at. These are typically different entities.\n\nA listener/emitter naming scheme would also be strange for events that aren't propagated, since the \"listener\" and \"emitter\" would be the same. To me, this would kind of imply that the target emitted the event to itself. These names also have no nice connection to the event triggering API; targeted events are triggered using `trigger_targets`, which makes `target` natural, but `listener`/`emitter` has no such

agree that `target` is too vague. I would much prefer the terminology to be clear about which entity its referring to.\n\nTo rephrase the kinds of entity we have:\n1. The original entity which was passed to `commands.trigger_targets`.\n2. The entity which should currently be considered, may be the same as the above or may be different due to bubbling.\n3. The entity which contains the `Observer` component.\n\nI do think that for 2., `.entity()` is the most intuitive name people will look for. It would make sense to add a doc-alias for `target`.\n\nfor 1. and 3. i strongly prefer something explicit, like `.original_target()` (mirrors `commands.trigger_targets`) and `.observer_entity()`. In normal use these should be needed rarely enough that a short name provides too little benefit for the potential confusion.\n\nI'm loosely in favour of splitting the `.trigger_targets()` API into `trigger_entities`/`components` - if only to make the argument type for each easier to read.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3107317146/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"laundmo","id":24855949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODU1OTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24855949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/laundmo","html_url":"https://github.com/laundmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laundmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laundmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laundmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laundmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laundmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laundmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laundmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laundmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/laundmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
