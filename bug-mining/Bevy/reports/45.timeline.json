Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #11695\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Added `delta: Option<Vec2>` to `bevy_window::CursorMoved`. `delta` is an `Option` because the `CursorMoved` event does get fired when the cursor was outside the window area in the last frame. In that case there is no cursor position from the last frame to compare with the current cursor position. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Added `delta: Option<Vec2>` to `bevy_window::CursorMoved`. \r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- You need to add `delta` to any manually created `CursorMoved` struct.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11710/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11710/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1927458281","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11695#issuecomment-1927458281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11695","id":1927458281,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U85y4q3p","user":{"login":"Sebbl0508","id":28149337,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTQ5MzM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28149337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebbl0508","html_url":"https://github.com/Sebbl0508","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebbl0508/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebbl0508/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebbl0508/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebbl0508/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebbl0508/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebbl0508/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebbl0508/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebbl0508/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sebbl0508/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-05T16:50:29Z","updated_at":"2024-02-05T16:50:29Z","body":"> I agree that this might be useful, but since `CursorMoved` is a translated version of the `winit::CursorMoved` struct which does not include `delta`, I don't know if this is the place to add it.\r\n\r\nThat's what i thought too.\r\nNice PR btw.
