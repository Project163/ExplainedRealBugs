That is why for now I focused on how the API appears while there are more issues.\n\nThe methods [`Events::oldest_event_count`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/event/struct.Events.html#method.oldest_event_count) and [`Events::oldest_id`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/event/struct.Events.html#method.oldest_id) seem to do the same thing when looked at the docs or the source.\n\nAlso the API itself is confusing. Instead of returning `usize` it should return an `Option<EventId<E>>` because no oldest event might be available currently if the sequences `events_b` and `events_a` are empty.\n\nAs a side note, the implementation of `oldest_event_count` looks like that:\n\n```rs\n/// Returns the index of the oldest event stored in the event buffer.\npub fn oldest_event_count(&self) -> usize {\n    self.events_a\n        .start_event_count\n        .min(self.events_b.start_event_count)\n}\n```\n\nWhen it should be clear that `self.events_b` as the more recent sequence cannot contain the oldest count.\n\n- `oldest_event_count` was added by https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/5730\n- `oldest_id` was added by https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/5735","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15617/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
