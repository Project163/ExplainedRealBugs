bevy_clippy_warn\ncargo add bevy\n```\n\n```rust [main.rs]\nuse bevy::{math::Vec2, reflect::Reflect, render::render_resource::ShaderType};\n\n#[derive(ShaderType, Debug, Clone, Reflect)]\npub struct MyMaterial {\n    pub some_field: f32,\n    pub some_other_field: i32,\n    pub yet_another_field: Vec2,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let material = MyMaterial {\n        some_field: 69.42,\n

warnings:\n\n```\nwarning: function `check` is never used\n --> src/main.rs:5:21\n  |\n5 |     pub some_field: f32,\n  |                     ^^^\n  |\n  = note: `#[warn(dead_code)]` on by

over at [my repo](https://github.com/GaspardCulis/robot-rumble-rs/actions/runs/15610205852/job/43969084276) which fails because of this. Tried to fix it with `#[allow(dead_code)]` on top of my module of on top of the struct but it doesn't help.\n\nI guess it comes from the `ShaderType` proc
