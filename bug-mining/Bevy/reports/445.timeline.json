a new window is spawned, winit sends a key released event for to the old window and a key pressed event to the new one (tested without Bevy too).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if that's intentional. If not, we need to crate an issue in the winit repo; if it is, we need to work around this by ignoring key release events if in the same frame a window has been created and a key press event for the same button gets received.\r\n\r\nEdit: These event happen when a window loses/gains focus. They have the `is_synthetic` flag set in that case. There's currently a discussion on whether winit should keep synthetic events: rust-windowing/winit#3543\r\n\r\nSo `just_pressed` and `just_released` are bugged. They trigger not just when the key was just pressed/released but also when focus was gained/lost with the key pressed.\r\n\r\nWe could just ignore synthetic events ourselves. The problem is that the button state can change while no Bevy window is focused. I think it might be best to wait until Bevy gains focus again to check whether to emit those events, and maybe keep the current behavior as a separate function.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1980048216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SpecificProtagonist","id":30270112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjcwMTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30270112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist","html_url":"https://github.com/SpecificProtagonist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"SpecificProtagonist","id":30270112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjcwMTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30270112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist","html_url":"https://github.com/SpecificProtagonist","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SpecificProtagonist/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-06T16:45:43Z","updated_at":"2024-03-06T16:45:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12331","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12331/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12331/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12331/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12331","id":2170515333,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U85oyWfS","number":12331,"title":"We

Bevy version\r\n\r\n0.13.2\r\n\r\n## Relevant system information\r\n\r\nArchLinux with i3wm window manager alongside KDE using X11\r\n\r\n## What you did\r\n\r\nI press Alt+Tab to change focus to my bevy application.\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\nI expected this to change focus to my application, and nothing else.\r\n\r\nWhat happend: It caused a key press event of the TAB key and triggered the application action associated with the TAB key.\r\n\r\nThis happens with any key that is used for focus switching. For example, if I use my window manager's \"alt+w\" key binding to switch to the workspace of the game, it registers as a key press of the \"w\" key, which causes my character to unintentionally move forward.\r\n\r\nWorse yet, those keys get stuck in a \"permanently pressed\" state, triggering the actions forever, until I press the respective key once again.\r\n\r\nThis is driving me crazy as I switch focus back/forth between my bevy application a lot.\r\n\r\n## Additional information / Cause\r\n\r\nThis is caused by bevy erroneously interpreting winit's \"synthetic\" key presses as real key presses.\r\n\r\nIf I add a check for [is_synthetic](https://docs.rs/winit/0.30.0/winit/event/enum.WindowEvent.html#variant.KeyboardInput.field.is_synthetic) in [bevy's winit KeyboardInput event handler](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/aa80e2d658ed1b84787fd512839a8c84238979ef/crates/bevy_winit/src/lib.rs#L447):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nWindowEvent::KeyboardInput { ref event, is_synthetic, .. } => {\r\n    if !is_synthetic {\r\n        if event.state.is_pressed() {\r\n            if let Some(char) = &event.text {\r\n                let char = char.clone();\r\n                app.send_event(ReceivedCharacter { window, char });\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        app.send_event(converters::convert_keyboard_input(event, window));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the phantom key press events disappear in my application.\r\n\r\nThis is likely not the full solution though. While the phantom key **press** events are a clear bug, the phantom key **release** events might serve a purpose and possibly should be exposed. See https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/3543#issuecomment-1973024673\r\n\r\nIf you decide to not filter out synthetic keys, please at least expose the fact that they are synthetic to the user so we can filter them out ourselves. This would be suboptimal solution, but better than nothing.\r\n\r\n- Relevant winit example: [control_flow](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/blob/ab33fb8eda45f9a23587465d787a70a309c67ec4/examples/control_flow.rs) (or any other that responds to key presses)\r\n- Relevant bevy example: [keyboard_input_events](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/d9d305dab5b3b7a12a634ea7adb5c5a4c6406ec1/examples/input/keyboard_input_events.rs)\r\n- Relevant winit bug report: https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/3691\r\n- Relevant winit discussion: https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/3543\r\n\r\nIf I can help in any way with solving this, don't

Objective\r\n\r\nDefocusing a window while a key is held (such as when Alt+tabbing), will currently send a key release on X11 and Windows. This is likely the behavior that most people expect.  \r\nHowever it's synthetic events from winit are unimplemented for WASM and some other platforms. (See https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/1272).\r\nWhile we can implement it upstream, there is also some doubt about the synthetic events API as a whole (https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/3543), so I propose to do it in bevy directly for now.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR implements key tracking in bevy directly so we can synthesize our own key release events across all platforms.\r\n\r\nNote regarding X11 specifically:\r\n- On `main`, pressing a keyboard shortcut to unfocus the window (`Ctrl + Super + ArrowRight` in my case) will yield the following events:\r\n```\r\nPressed Control\r\nPressed Super\r\nReleased Control\r\nReleased ArrowRight\r\nReleased Super\r\n```\r\n- On this branch, it will yield the following sequence:\r\n```\r\nPressed Control\r\nPressed Super\r\nReleased Control\r\nReleased Super\r\n```\r\nTo me the behavior of this branch is more expected than `main`, because `main` produces an `ArrowRight` release without producing a press first.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTested in WASM and X11 with\r\n```rust\r\nApp::new()\r\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\r\n        .add_systems(Update, |mut keys: EventReader<KeyboardInput>| {\r\n            for ev in keys.read() {\r\n                error!(\"received {ev:?}\");\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n        .run();\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14379/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14379/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
