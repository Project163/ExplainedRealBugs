Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #15791.\r\n\r\nAs raised in #11022, scaling orthographic cameras is confusing! In Bevy 0.14, there were multiple completely redundant ways to do this, and no clear guidance on which to use.\r\n\r\nAs a result, #15075 removed the `scale` field from `OrthographicProjection` completely, solving the redundancy issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, this resulted in an unintuitive API and a painful migration, as discussed in #15791. Users simply want to change a single parameter to zoom, rather than deal with the irrelevant details of how the camera is being scaled.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts #15075, and takes an alternate, more nuanced approach to the redundancy problem. `ScalingMode::WindowSize` was by far the biggest offender. This was the default variant, and stored a float that was *fully* redundant to setting `scale`.\r\n\r\nAll of the other variants contained meaningful semantic information and had an intuitive scale. I could have made these unitless, storing an aspect ratio, but this would have been a worse API and resulted in a pointlessly painful migration.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this work I've also:\r\n\r\n- improved the documentation to explain that you should just set `scale` to zoom cameras\r\n- swapped to named fields for all of the variants in `ScalingMode` for more clarity about the parameter meanings\r\n- substantially improved the `projection_zoom` example\r\n- removed the footgunny `Mul` and `Div` impls for `ScalingMode`, especially since these no longer have the intended effect on `ScalingMode::WindowSize`.\r\n- removed a rounding step because this is now redundant 🎉 \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI've tested these changes as part of my work in the `projection_zoom` example, and things seem to work fine.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n`ScalingMode` has been refactored for clarity, especially on how to zoom orthographic cameras and their projections:\r\n\r\n- `ScalingMode::WindowSize` no longer stores a float, and acts as if its value was 1. Divide your camera's scale by any previous value to achieve identical results.\r\n- `ScalingMode::FixedVertical` and `FixedHorizontal` now use named fields.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15969/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14703576915,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86ZkFzLzwAAAANsZsdT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14703576915","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2bd328220bd3f8fed52f8ee7ec932fd0e9dc173d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/2bd328220bd3f8fed52f8ee7ec932fd0e9dc173d","created_at":"2024-10-17T18:09:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14703577141,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86ZkFzLzwAAAANsZsg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14703577141","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-17T18:09:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
