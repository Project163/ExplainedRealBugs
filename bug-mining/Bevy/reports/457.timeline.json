What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\nImagine you have a character that has an attack animations really focused on the upper body. And you want him to still walk while he is doing such animation. That is why bone masks, exist. It basically say hey run two animation_clips at the same time one solely affecting the upper bones while the other affects the lower body.  \r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n1 - I think we should create a bone mask struct, that points out the bones that can be affected by multiple animations. \r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct BoneMask {\r\n    bones: HashSet<Entities>, // Dont know what would be more optimal\r\n    animation_clip:  // Animation clip that will override.\r\n    weight// Weight of how much the alternative clip will affect the specific bone\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2- Create a function that grab those bones, and override their variable curves. With the new variable curves from the given animation clip or the in between weighted values among them.\r\n\r\n3- Make it so it is nodable (like you can make a node that will do that for you, kinda like blend node) in animation graph . \r\n\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nThere is none, the current blend node affects all bones at once\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThis will really help my game, and since i already implemented in it I dont see a problem implementing it here\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14747/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"pcwalton","id":157897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton","html_url":"https://github.com/pcwalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-01T22:48:20Z","updated_at":"2024-09-01T22:48:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15013","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15013/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15013/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15013/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15013","id":2499721792,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U856GOZm","number":15013,"title":"Implement animation masks, allowing fine control of the targets that animations affect.","user":{"login":"pcwalton","id":157897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton","html_url":"https://github.com/pcwalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619326,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Feature","name":"C-Feature","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A new feature, making something new possible"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

commit adds support for *masks* to the animation graph. A mask is a set of animation targets (bones) that neither a node nor its descendants are allowed to animate. Animation targets can be assigned one or more *mask group*s, which are specific to a single graph. If a node masks out any mask group that an animation target belongs to, animation curves for that target will be ignored during evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe canonical use case for masks is to support characters holding objects. Typically, character animations will contain hand animations in the case that the character's hand is empty. (For example, running animations may close a character's fingers into a fist.) However, when the character is holding an object, the animation must be altered so that the hand grips the object.\r\n\r\nBevy currently has no convenient way to handle this. The only workaround that I can see is to have entirely separate animation clips for characters' hands and bodies and keep them in sync, which is burdensome and doesn't match artists' expectations from other engines, which all effectively have support for masks. However, with mask group support, this task is simple. We assign each hand to a mask group and parent all character animations to a node. When a character grasps an object in hand, we position the fingers as appropriate and then enable the mask group for that hand in that node. This allows the character's animations to run normally, while the object remains correctly attached to the hand.\r\n\r\nNote that even with this PR, we won't have support for running separate animations for a character's hand and the rest of the character. This is because we're missing additive blending: there's no way to combine the two masked animations together properly. I intend that to be a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nThe major engines all have support for masks, though the workflow varies from engine to engine:\r\n\r\n* Unity has support for masks [essentially as implemented here], though with layers instead of a tree.  However, when using the Mecanim (\"Humanoid\") feature, precise control over bones is lost in favor of predefined muscle groups.\r\n\r\n* Unreal has a feature named [*layered blend per bone*]. This allows for separate blend weights for different bones, effectively achieving masks. I believe that the combination of blend nodes and masks make Bevy's animation graph as expressible as that of Unreal, once we have support for additive blending, though you may have to use more nodes than you would in Unreal. Moreover, separating out the concepts of \"blend weight\" and \"which bones this node applies to\" seems like a cleaner design than what Unreal has.\r\n\r\n* Godot's `AnimationTree` has the notion of [*blend filters*], which are essentially the same as masks as implemented in this PR.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this patch fixes a bug with weight evaluation whereby weights weren't properly propagated down to grandchildren, because the weight evaluation for a node only checked its parent's weight, not its evaluated weight. I considered submitting this as a separate PR, but given that this PR refactors that code entirely to support masks and weights under a unified \"evaluated node\" concept, I simply included the fix here.\r\n\r\nA new example, `animation_masks`, has been added. It demonstrates how to toggle masks on and off for specific portions of a skin.\r\n\r\nThis is part of #14395, but I'm going to defer closing that issue until we have additive blending.\r\n\r\n[essentially as implemented here]: https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/class-AvatarMask.html\r\n\r\n[*layered blend per bone*]: https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-layered-animations-in-unreal-engine\r\n\r\n[*blend filters*]: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/animation/animation_tree.html\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n* The serialized format of animation graphs has changed with the addition of animation masks. To upgrade animation graph RON files, add `mask` and `mask_groups` fields as appropriate.

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\n* `AnimationPlayer` always normalizes all weights to sum = 1, and has the invariant of \"no ancestor AnimationPlayer\", this makes composing animations impossible since your `BodyAnimation` and `HandAnimation` will each have 0.5 weight, when they would both want 1.0 weight to be composed.\r\n\r\n* `AnimationTransitions` does not start playing child nodes recursively, making it counterintuitive with `AnimationGraph`'s design.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nAdd a lower level `AnimationWeights` component like `HashMap<AnimationNodeIndex, f32(weight)>` so users can opt out of `AnimationPlayer` and weight normalization by using custom logic.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nAddress

blending* is an ubiquitous feature in game engines that allows animations to be concatenated instead of blended. The canonical use case is to allow a character to hold a weapon while performing arbitrary poses. For example, if you had a character that needed to be able to walk or run while attacking with a weapon, the typical workflow is to have an additive blend node that combines walking and running animation clips with an animation clip of one of the limbs performing a weapon attack animation.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds support for additive blending to Bevy. It builds on top of the flexible infrastructure in #15589 and introduces a new type of node, the *add node*. Like blend nodes, add nodes combine the animations of their children according to their weights. Unlike blend nodes, however, add nodes don't normalize the weights to 1.0.\r\n\r\nThe `animation_masks` example has been overhauled to demonstrate the use of additive blending in combination with masks. There are now controls to choose an animation clip for every limb of the fox individually.\r\n\r\nThis patch also fixes a bug whereby masks were incorrectly accumulated with `insert()` during the graph threading phase, which could cause corruption of computed masks in some cases.\r\n\r\nNote that the `clip` field has been replaced with an `AnimationNodeType` enum, which breaks `animgraph.ron` files. The `Fox.animgraph.ron` asset has been updated to the new format.\r\n\r\nCloses #14395.\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52dfe05f-fdb3-477a-9462-ec150f93df33\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n* The `animgraph.ron` format has changed to accommodate the new *additive blending* feature. You'll need to change `clip` fields to instances of the new `AnimationNodeType` enum.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15631/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2392404136","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14395#issuecomment-2392404136","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14395","id":2392404136,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86OmTCo","user":{"login":"pcwalton","id":157897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzg5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton","html_url":"https://github.com/pcwalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcwalton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-03T21:51:30Z","updated_at":"2024-10-03T21:51:30Z","body":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/15631
