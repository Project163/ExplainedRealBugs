issue, I'm not using headless plugins but it will be great if the compile-time of CI/server side projects will compile faster and will have less bloat in the final binaries (that also concerns games with visuals, please track your dependencies & its features, guys). In the current state of rust, its linker cannot predict with absolute precision which dependencies won't be used at runtime, so I think only 85% of the final binary will contain the code you really need if you import too heavy dependencies without setting the only features you
