Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #12064\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nPrior to #11326, the \"global physical\" translation of text was rounded.\r\n\r\nAfter #11326, only the \"offset\" is being rounded.\r\n\r\nThis moves things around so that the \"global translation\" is converted to physical pixels, rounded, and then converted back to logical pixels, which is what I believe was happening before / what the comments above describe.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nThis seems to work and fix an obvious mistake in some code, but I don't fully grok the ui / text pipelines / math here.\r\n\r\n## Before / After
