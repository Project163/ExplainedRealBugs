What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `QueryData` derive macro transforms fields of the type `&'static mut T` to `Mut<'w, T>` when generating the item type for the query. However, the readonly item type continues to use `&'w T` as the reference type. This makes it impossible to use change detection on the readonly form of mutable queries.\r\n\r\nAs an example from my code:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(QueryData)]\r\n#[query_data(mutable)]\r\npub struct TextBoxQuery {\r\n    pub data: &'static mut TextBox,\r\n    pub style: &'static mut TextBoxStyle,\r\n    pub text_style: &'static mut TextBoxTextStyle,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// derive(QueryData) output\r\npub struct TextBoxQueryItem<'w> {\r\n    pub data: Mut<'w, TextBox>,\r\n    pub style: Mut<'w, TextBoxStyle>,\r\n    pub text_style: Mut<'w, TextBoxTextStyle>,\r\n}\r\n\r\npub struct TextBoxQueryReadOnlyItem<'w> {\r\n    pub data: &'w TextBox,\r\n    pub style: &'w TextBoxStyle,\r\n    pub text_style: &'w TextBoxTextStyle,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nI would like a way to inform the `QueryData` derive macro to use `bevy_ecs::change_detection::Ref<'w, T>` instead of `&'w T`. I believe it would be useful if we can choose between applying it to the whole struct or to individual fields, like so:\r\n\r\n### Example 1: Whole struct application\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(QueryData)]\r\n#[query_data(mutable, detect_changes)]\r\npub struct TextBoxQuery {\r\n    pub data: &'static mut TextBox,\r\n    pub style: &'static mut TextBoxStyle,\r\n    pub text_style: &'static mut TextBoxTextStyle,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// derive(QueryData) output\r\npub struct TextBoxQueryItem<'w> {\r\n    pub data: Mut<'w, TextBox>,\r\n    pub style: Mut<'w, TextBoxStyle>,\r\n    pub text_style: Mut<'w, TextBoxTextStyle>,\r\n}\r\n\r\npub struct TextBoxQueryReadOnlyItem<'w> {\r\n    pub data: Ref<'w, TextBox>,\r\n    pub style: Ref<'w, TextBoxStyle>,\r\n    pub text_style: Ref<'w, TextBoxTextStyle>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example 2: Per field application\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(QueryData)]\r\n#[query_data(mutable)]\r\npub struct TextBoxQuery {\r\n    #[query_data(detect_changes)]\r\n    pub data: &'static mut TextBox,\r\n\r\n    pub style: &'static mut TextBoxStyle,\r\n    pub text_style: &'static mut TextBoxTextStyle,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// derive(QueryData) output\r\npub struct TextBoxQueryItem<'w> {\r\n    pub data: Mut<'w, TextBox>,\r\n    pub style: Mut<'w, TextBoxStyle>,\r\n    pub text_style: Mut<'w, TextBoxTextStyle>,\r\n}\r\n\r\npub struct TextBoxQueryReadOnlyItem<'w> {\r\n    pub data: Ref<'w, TextBox>,\r\n    pub style: &'w TextBoxStyle,\r\n    pub text_style: &'w TextBoxTextStyle,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nThe only other option I can see is for me to manually implement `WorldQuery` on `TextBoxQuery`, and I do not wish to manually implement `WorldQuery` due to how brittle it is.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12920/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12920/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12778927575,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86IjiQnzwAAAAL5rvXX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12778927575","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-12T15:56:55Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Triage","color":"D876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12778927578,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86IjiQnzwAAAAL5rvXa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12778927578","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-12T15:56:55Z","label":{"name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12778927781,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86IjiQnzwAAAAL5rval","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12778927781","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-12T15:57:04Z","label":{"name":"X-Contentious","color":"D93F0B"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12778927783,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86IjiQnzwAAAAL5rvan","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12778927783","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://ap

This provides users the ability to explicitly opt-in to change detection in the read-only forms of queries.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nA documentation test was added to `Mut` showcasing the new functionality.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n- Added an implementation of `WorldQuery` and `QueryData` on `bevy_ecs::change_detection::Mut`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13338/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12801821500,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86IjiQnzwAAAAL7DEs8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12801821500","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"dcf24dfd6b414683f7028ae17bf1067c200bd638","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/dcf24dfd6b414683f7028ae17bf1067c200bd638","created_at":"2024-05-14T12:54:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12801821722,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86IjiQnzwAAAAL7DEwa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12801821722","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-14T12:54:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
