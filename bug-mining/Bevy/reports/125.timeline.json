Objective\r\n\r\n- Adds Addition and subtraction as well as scalar multiplication/division for colors, suggestion of #12202 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- All of the above operations add/mul/sub/div the color channels of all color types directly (similar to what was already possible for `Srgba`.\r\n- The alpha channel is blended for addition and subtraction according to \r\n  - `alpha_result = alpha_a + alpha_b * (1 - alpha_a)` for addition and\r\n  - `alpha_result = alpha_a * (1 - alpha_b)` for subtraction\r\nThese are common alpha blending functions and ensure that when `alpha_b` and `alpha_a` are in `0..1`, `alpha_result` will be in `0..1` as well.\r\n- For scalar multiplication/division the alpha channel is left unchanged.\r\n- By adding the above operations, `bevy_math::cubic_splines::Point` could also be implemented.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n<del>I have added `Add<Color> for Color` and `Sub<Color> for Color` as well but these require a lot of

Objective\r\n\r\n- Adds arithmatic operations for colors so they can be used with splines, suggestion of #12202 and incorporating feedback from #12460 and #12534\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- This PR adds a `LinearConvexSpace` trait as suggested by @alice-i-cecile [in this comment](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/12534#issuecomment-2002515053). This trait has everything needed for splines including arithatic operations such as addition or subtraction.\r\n- `LinearConvexSpace` does not implement `std::ops::Add` and friends because those operations are not well defined for some types (such as colors) allthough those types may be used to define a linear convex space.  \r\n- `LinearConvexSpace<Scalar>` is generic over some `Scalar` type so that `LinearConvexSpace` may also be used for `f64` or `u32` based types such as `DVec2`. These types cannot be used with splines but since `LinearConvexSpace` does not suggest only being used with splines, this might be useful in the future, allthough I am happy to remove this if wanted.\r\n- I have added a `impl_linear_convex_space!(Type, Scalar)` macro that will automatically implement `LinearConvexSpace<Scalar> for Type` using the `std::ops::*` traits.\r\n- Color types implement `LinearConvexSpace<f32>` using a macro `impl_color_linear_convex_space` local to `bevy_color`. All operations on color types are componentwise with no special rules for the alpha channel.\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- The `Point` trait from `cubic_splines.rs` has been removed; as such any type that is supposed to be used with splines should implement `LinearConvexSpace<f32>` now.

Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #12202 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- This PR implements componentwise (including alpha) addition, subtraction and scalar multiplication/division for some color types.\r\n- The mentioned color types are `Laba`, `Oklaba`, `LinearRgba` and `Xyza` as all of them are either physically or perceptually linear as mentioned by @alice-i-cecile in the issue.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Scalar mul/div for `LinearRgba` may modify alpha now.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- Users of scalar mul/div for `LinearRgba` need to be aware of the change and maybe use the

already clamped.\r\n- Adds a `color_animation.rs` example.\r\n- Implements the `*Assign` operators for color types that already had the corresponding operators.

What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nMany of our existing color spaces have a robust set of operations that can be used for blending, animating and otherwise mixing colors:\r\n\r\n1. Mathematical operations, for raw operations.\r\n2. The `Mix` trait.\r\n3. The `Point` trait, for interop with the splines in `bevy_math`.\r\n4. `Animatable`, for interop with `bevy_animation`.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is only currently done for \"straightforwardly linear\" color spaces. Some (like `Srgba`) are neither perceptually nor physically linear, and therefore are simply not a good choice to interpolate through.\r\n\r\nBut others, like `Hsla`, `Hsva` or `Lcha` have a different problem: their \"hue\" parameter loops around on itself. Rather than representing the space of colors as a straighforward \"cube\", with three independent orthogonal linear axes, the third axis behaves like an angle. For this reason, they are called \"cylindrical color spaces\": the hue parameter acts as a polar coordinate.\r\n\r\nWe should be able to define an intuitive set of linear operations over this space: it's simply trickier and will require the use of the `.rem_euclid` family of methods to perform modular arithmetic on floats.\r\n\r\nInterpolating colors in these spaces is a nice quality of life feature (as they're often quite intuitive to work in and are exported by a wide range of art software). But it also provides new functionality for users: being able to interpolate between orange and purple the \"short way around\" (through red), rather than the \"long way around\" (through green).\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nFor each of the cylindrical color spaces, implement:\r\n\r\n1. Add, Sub, AddAssign, SubAssign ~~and f32 multiplication.~~\r\n2. ~~The `Point` trait from `bevy_math`, to enable use with splines.~~\r\n3. The `Animatable` trait, to enable color blending via animation graphs.\r\n\r\nEDIT: As noted below, we *cannot* implement float multiplication in a reasonable way on these types, and so cannot use splines.\r\n\r\nBe sure to add tests to ensure that the appropriate properties of addition, subtraction and multiplication behave as you might expect in a linear space.\r\n\r\nAfter that PR, the only color types that *don't* implement these would be `Srgba` (really terrible to interpolate through) and the universal enum `Color` (very implicit as to which color space is used).\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nConvert to a flat linear color space before interpolating. This won't always give you the behavior you want though: being able to cycle around the red -> purple edge of the hues is a reasonable artistic choice that is not easily done in the existing flat color spaces, even if it's not particularly physical.\r\n\r\nWe could also implement these traits for `Srgba` (please, separate PR) and simply warn users that this is a probably a bad idea in the docs.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up to #12202, and was split out to reduce controversy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12617/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12209253926,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86A1wGzzwAAAALXum4m","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12209253926","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"887bc27a6f9dbee5a8d17e53f67aa69f34d4bbdc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/887bc27a6f9dbee5a8d17e53f67aa69f34d4bbdc","created_at":"2024-03-22T00:20:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12209254027,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86A1wGzzwAAAALXum6L","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12209254027","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-22T00:20:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
