The panel is first spawned as a child of another entity (to have access to the `ChildBuilder` needed to populate it's content), then I call `remove_parent()` on the panel (via commands) with a system in `Update`.\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\n- Changes to the `Style` component aren't reflected on the panel, i.e. left/top positioning and display properties are ignored. Except when the Window is resized.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nThe `Interaction` component is updated as if the `Style` didn't change, so it seems the issue is around the calculation of the transforms or updates to the `Node` props.\r\n\r\nThe `Style` is correctly processed if the original parent node is despawned, so this works as expected:\r\n```\r\nlet mut floating_panel_id = Entity::PLACEHOLDER;\r\ncommands\r\n  .spawn_empty()\r\n  .with_children(|parent| {\r\n    // The FloatingPanel has a component that tells an `Update` system to remove the parent\r\n    let (panel_id, mut container) = FloatingPanel::build(/*args*/);\r\n\r\n    floating_panel_id = panel_id;\r\n    container.with_children(|parent| {\r\n        // populate content\r\n    });\r\n})\r\n.despawn();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this does not work:\r\n```\r\nlet mut floating_panel_id = Entity::PLACEHOLDER;\r\n// entity is a NodeBundle and a part of the working UI\r\ncommands.entity(entity).with_children(|parent| {\r\n  let (panel_id, mut container) = FloatingPanel::build(/*args*/);\r\n\r\n  floating_panel_id = panel_id;\r\n  container.with_children(|parent| {\r\n      // populate content\r\n  });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemoving the parent:\r\n```\r\n// Necessary, as you cannot remove the parent immediately after spawning due to how the hierarchy systems work\r\nfn remove_node_parent(\r\n    q_to_remove: Query<Entity, Added<RemoveParent>>,\r\n    mut commands: Commands,\r\n) {\r\n    for entity in &q_to_remove {\r\n        commands\r\n            .entity(entity)\r\n            .remove_parent()\r\n            .remove::<RemoveParent>();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: After more trial and error, it seems that even if the panel is spawn directly without a parent the loss of updates can occur. Randomly, I would say. I had a working version, but then it stopped working after a few builds even though I did not touch this part. The key difference between when it is working and when it's not seems to be about when the panel is spawned. During `Startup` always seem to work. During `Update`, usually not.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11385/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
