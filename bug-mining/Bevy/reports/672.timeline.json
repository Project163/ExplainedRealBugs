Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #15417.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Remove the `labeled_assets` fields from `LoadedAsset` and `ErasedLoadedAsset`.\r\n- Created new structs `CompleteLoadedAsset` and `CompleteErasedLoadedAsset` to hold the `labeled_subassets`.\r\n- When a subasset is `LoadContext::finish`ed, it produces a `CompleteLoadedAsset`.\r\n- When a `CompleteLoadedAsset` is added to a `LoadContext` (as a subasset), their `labeled_assets` are merged, reporting any overlaps.\r\n\r\nOne important detail to note: nested subassets with overlapping names could in theory have been used in the past for the purposes of asset preprocessing. Even though there was no way to access these \"shadowed\" nested subassets, asset preprocessing does get access to these nested subassets. This does not seem like a case we should support though. It is confusing at best.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- This is just a refactor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- Most uses of `LoadedAsset` and `ErasedLoadedAsset` should be replaced with `CompleteLoadedAsset` and `CompleteErasedLoadedAsset` respectively.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15481/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15481/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16255017705,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86X0KwMzwAAAAPI3-Lp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16255017705","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f17644879d4585e4f5cf5d0d7d5160ea455c624c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/f17644879d4585e4f5cf5d0d7d5160ea455c624c","created_at":"2025-02-10T21:24:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16255018998,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86X0KwMzwAAAAPI3-f2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16255018998","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-10T21:24:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
