There's a marker struct named `ColorText` that's used to query for the text component that it wants to change the color of. This is very similar in name to the `TextColor` Bevy component for setting the color of the text and is used in this example:\n\n```rust\nfn text_color_system(time: Res<Time>, mut query: Query<&mut TextColor, With<ColorText>>) \n```\n\nWhile there is a comment in this example that describes `ColorText`, I think it would make more sense, especially to new Bevy users who are referencing this example to build their first app, if we use a more descriptive and distinct name for this struct. Perhaps something like `ColorChangingText` or even `TextWeWantToChangeTheColorOf` if we wanted it be as plain as possible.\n\nUnrelated to the primary purpose of this issue, but related to this example, the comments that describe the structs use the term `unit struct`, which is something I haven't seen used before. AFAIK in other Bevy documentation and external resources, these kinds of structs are described as `markers`. I'm not totally clear on the distinction but if they mean the same thing, perhaps we should be consistent.
