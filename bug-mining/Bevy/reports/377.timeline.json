camera target.\r\n\r\nFixes #14945\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nIt's awkward to get the viewport size of the target for an individual node without walking the tree or adding extra fields to `Node`, so I removed `resolve_outlines_system` and instead the outline values are updated in `ui_layout_system`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14947/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14947/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14105987812,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86UbxaCzwAAAANIyErk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14105987812","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"be100b8760ba01d3119df0864838e94a725de5b5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/be100b8760ba01d3119df0864838e94a725de5b5","created_at":"2024-09-02T17:15:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14105987939,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86UbxaCzwAAAANIyEtj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14105987939","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-02T17:15:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14152443795,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86UbxaCzwAAAANLjSeT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14152443795","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"489c1e1a877a0416162c098579bf7f2b466cd9ae","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/489c1e1a877a0416162c098579bf7f2b466cd9ae","created_at":"2024-09-05T20:04:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"madsmtm","id":10577181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTc3MTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10577181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/madsmtm","html_url":"https://github.com/madsmtm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madsmtm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/madsmtm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mad

has multi-window support by modelling each window as an entity, and then (heavily handwaving) delegating to Winit for the rest. The user can then choose:\n- To create two cameras for their scene, and assign it to different windows.\n- To create sub-apps to get a new `World`, to allow e.g. running multiple instances of their game (not really supported yet, but I assume this is roughly how we'd go about it).\n\nThis is all great, but unfortunately, some functionality uses the `PrimaryWindow` to implement their windowing. This is basically never desired, as it locks that piece of functionality to only being available in a single window. This issue is intended to track removing instances of this, to improve multi-window support.\n\nI've condensed the usages of `PrimaryWindow` to essentially the following:\n- [ ] `bevy_render::camera::RenderTarget::normalize` should be changed to not need the primary window. Affects `bevy_core_pipeline`, `bevy_picking`, `bevy_sprite` and `bevy_ui`.\n- [ ] `bevy_input_focus::InputFocus` (and possibly `InputFocusVisible`) should be made `Component`s on the window `Entity` instead of `Resource`s. Affects `bevy_winit`'s ability to update accessibility nodes.\n- [ ] `bevy_text`: , seems to be a remnant of https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/5621.\n\nA few previous efforts in this vein:\n- https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/5621\n- https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/10559\n- https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14945\n\nTo be clear: I'm not advocating we get rid of `PrimaryWindow`, it can be useful for the user, and it's useful for controlling the close behaviour in `bevy_window` (also discussed in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13698). But we should avoid using it internally in Bevy (perhaps even add it as a Clippy `disallowed-types`?).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18362/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18362/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
