Objective\r\n\r\nWhen introduced, `Single` was intended to simply be silently skipped, allowing for graceful and efficient handling of systems during invalid game states (such as when the player is dead).\r\n\r\nHowever, this also caused missing resources to *also* be silently skipped, leading to confusing and very hard to debug failures. In 0.15.1, this behavior was reverted to a panic, making missing resources easier to debug, but largely making `Single` (and `Populated`) worthless, as they would panic during expected game states.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the consensus is that this behavior should differ on  a per-system-param basis. However, there was no sensible way to *do* that before this PR.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nSwap `SystemParam::validate_param` from a `bool` to:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n/// The outcome of system / system param validation,\r\n/// used by system executors to determine what to do with a system.\r\npub enum ValidationOutcome {\r\n    /// All system parameters were validated successfully and the system can be run.\r\n    Valid,\r\n    /// At least one system parameter failed validation, and an error must be handled.\r\n    /// By default, this will result in1 a panic. See [crate::error] for more information.\r\n    ///\r\n    /// This is the default behavior, and is suitable for system params that should *always* be valid,\r\n    /// either because sensible fallback behavior exists (like [`Query`] or because\r\n    /// failures in validation should be considered a bug in the user's logic that must be immediately addressed (like [`Res`]).\r\n    Invalid,\r\n    /// At least one system parameter failed validation, but the system should be skipped due to [`ValidationBehavior::Skip`].\r\n    /// This is suitable for system params that are intended to only operate in certain application states, such as [`Single`].\r\n    Skipped,\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen, inside of each `SystemParam` implementation, return either Valid, Invalid or Skipped.\r\n\r\nCurrently, only `Single`, `Option<Single>` and `Populated` use the `Skipped` behavior. Other params (like resources) retain their current failing\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nMessed around with the fallible_params example. Added a pair of tests: one for panicking when resources are missing, and another for properly skipping `Single` and `Populated` system params.\r\n\r\n## To do\r\n\r\n- [x] get https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18454 merged\r\n- [x] fix the todo!() in the macro-powered tuple implementation (please help 🥺)\r\n- [x] test\r\n- [x] write a migration guide\r\n- [x] update the example comments\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nVarious system and system parameter validation methods (`SystemParam::validate_param`, `System::validate_param` and `System::validate_param_unsafe`) now return and accept a `ValidationOutcome` enum, rather than a `bool`.  The previous `true` values map to `ValidationOutcome::Valid`, while `false` maps to `ValidationOutcome::Invalid`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you wrote a custom schedule executor, you should now respect the new `ValidationOutcome::Skipped` parameter, skipping any systems whose validation was skipped. By contrast, `ValidationOutcome::Invalid` systems should also be skipped, but you should call the `default_error_handler` on them first, which by default will result in a panic.\r\n\r\nIf you are implementing a custom `SystemParam`, you should consider whether failing system param validation is an error or an expected state, and choose between `Invalid` and `Skipped` accordingly. In Bevy itself, `Single` and `Populated` now once again skip the system when their conditions are not met. This is the 0.15.0 behavior, but stands in contrast to the 0.15.1 behavior, where they would panic.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18504/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"chescock","id":8494645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0OTQ2NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8494645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock","html_url":"https://github.com/chescock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-26T00:45:47Z","updated_at":"2025-03-26T00:45:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18541","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18541/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18541/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18541/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/18541","id":2947283381,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U86QFZr-","number":18541,"title":"Replace ValidationOutcome with Result","user":{"login":"chescock","id":8494645,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0OTQ2NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8494645?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock","html_url":"https://github.com/chescock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chescock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":2287994822,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjg3OTk0ODIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Code-Quality","name":"C-Code-Quality","color":"B8B8B8","default":false,"description":"A section of code that is hard to understand or change"},{"id":2747857990,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODU3OTkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Usability","name":"C-Usability","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A targeted quality-of-life change that makes Bevy easier to use"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #18515 \r\n\r\nAfter the recent changes to system param validation, the panic message for a missing resource is currently: \r\n\r\n```\r\nEncountered an error in system `missing_resource_error::res_system`: SystemParamValidationError { skipped: false }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd the parameter type name and a descriptive message, improving the panic message to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEncountered an error in system `missing_resource_error::res_system`: SystemParamValidationError { skipped: false, message: \"Resource does not exist\", param: \"bevy_ecs::change_detection::Res<missing_resource_error::MissingResource>\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdd fields to `SystemParamValidationError` for error context.  Include the `type_name` of the param and a message.  \r\n\r\nStore them as `Cow<'static, str>` and only format them into a friendly string in the `Display` impl.  This lets us create errors using a `&'static str` with no allocation or formatting, while still supporting runtime `String` values if necessary.  \r\n\r\nAdd a unit test that verifies the panic message.\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\n\r\nIf we change the default error handling to use `Display` instead of `Debug`, and to use `ShortName` for the system name, the panic message could be further improved to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEncountered an error in system `res_system`: Parameter `Res<MissingResource>` failed validation: Resource does not exist\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `BevyError` currently includes the backtrace in `Debug` but not `Display`, and I didn't want to try to change that in this PR.
