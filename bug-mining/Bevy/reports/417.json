The only reason that `Res<T>` and `ResMut<T>` exist is that system params need to use the type to distinguish resources from other data. Otherwise, `Res{Mut}<T>` do not need to exist, and thus we have always treated `Ref<T>` and `Mut<T>` and as the change detection primitives. `ResMut::map_unchanged` and `ResMut::reborrow` have always returned `Mut<T>` to reflect this.\r\n\r\nI disagree with returning `Res<T>` here, as it encourages more use of this type. We should use types like `Res<T>` and `ResMut<T>` and little as possible, so we won't need to duplicate all change detection APIs for these types.\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\n`World::resource_ref` should return `Ref<T>`.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/9926\r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11776\r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11776\r\nhttps://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/9940\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11825/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11825/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
