Bevy version\r\n\r\nv0.13.1\r\n\r\n## What you did\r\n\r\nI was upgrading my RPG textboxes to use the new 9-slicing feature, but creating a sliced sprite with an anchor not set to `Anchor::Center` does not work right.\r\n\r\n## What went wrong\r\n\r\nCreating the textbox background with `Anchor::Center` works fine, and looks like this: \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/87248184/eb6955fe-178c-4ca2-8c0a-42187b65470a)\r\n\r\nCreated with this code:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet sprite_child = commands\r\n

.id();\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreating the textbox background with `Anchor::TopLeft` (with position adjusted correspondingly) does *not* work fine, and looks like this: \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/87248184/118658a5-737e-4c69-9d67-e130a27141be)\r\n\r\nCreated with this code:\r\n```rust\r\nlet sprite_child = commands\r\n
