In other words, it's a rectangle of infinite negative size.\r\n\r\nThis is a common practice in *many* other geometry libraries. The reasoning is simple: an empty rectangle is often used when calculating the union of a series of rectangles (that is, the outer bounds of all of them.). The union of a finite rect A with a negative infinite rect B is just A. So we can start with an empty rect and successively union with each rectangle in turn, using a classic \"reduce\" or \"fold\" method.\r\n\r\nNote that the `EMPTY` rect is not the same as a zero-size rect. The rect that is the result of too much negative inflation is not the same as `EMPTY` because it is still centered at the point of the original rect.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @viridia in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/13452#discussion_r1608605536_\r\n            ","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13461/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/13461/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
