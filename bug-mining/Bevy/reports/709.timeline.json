Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #18051\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Switched function registry to use `bevy_platform_support::sync` instead of `std::sync`\r\n- Also documented that `debug_stack` (and transitively `debug`) require `std`\r\n- Also removed `std` from `wgpu-types` since that crate is now `no_std` compatible\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- `cargo check -p bevy_reflect --no-default-features --features critical-section,documentation,glam,glam/libm,smallvec,wgpu-types,functions --target thumbv6m-none-eabi`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nWith these changes, `bevy_reflect`'s feature support looks like this:\r\n\r\n| Feature | `no_std` (Before) | `no_std` (After) | Notes |\r\n| - | - | - | - |\r\n| `default` | ❌ | ❌ | |\r\n| `std` | ❌ | ❌ | |\r\n| `documentation` | ✔️ | ✔️ | |\r\n| `functions` | ❌ | ✔️ | |\r\n| `critical-section` | ✔️ | ✔️ | |\r\n| `bevy` | ✔️* | ✔️* | Partial due to `smol_str` |\r\n| `debug` | ❌ | ❌ | |\r\n| `debug_stack` | ❌ | ❌ | |\r\n| `petgraph` | ❌ | ❌ | |\r\n| `glam` | ✔️* | ✔️* | Requires enabling `glam/libm` |\r\n| `smallvec` | ✔️ | ✔️ | |\r\n| `uuid` | ✔️* | ✔️* | Requires setting up `getrandom` backend |\r\n| `wgpu-types ` | ❌ | ✔️ | |\r\n| `smol_str` | ✔️* | ✔️* | Partial due to `smol_str` not supporting `portable-atomic`
