Objective\r\nIf you try to add an object to the hashmap that is not capable of hashing, the program panics. For easier debugging, the type for that object should be included in the error message.\r\n\r\nFixes #13646.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\ninitially i tried calling std::any::type_name_of_val. this had the problem that it would print something like dyn Box<dyn Reflect>, not helpful. But since these objects all implement Reflect, i used Reflect::type_path() instead. Previously, the error message was part of a constant called HASH_ERROR. i changed that to a macro called hash_error to print the type of that object more easily\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\ni adapted the unit test reflect_map_no_hash to expect the type in that panic aswell\r\n\r\nsince this is my first contribution, please let me know if i have done everything

@MrGVSV.\r\nThe error message will now read `the given key (of type bevy_reflect::tests::Foo) does not support hashing` or 'the given key (of type bevy_reflect::DynamicStruct) does not support hashing' in case of a dynamic struct that represents a hashable struct\r\n\r\ni also added a new unit test for this new behaviour (`reflect_map_no_hash_dynamic`).\r\nFixes #13646
