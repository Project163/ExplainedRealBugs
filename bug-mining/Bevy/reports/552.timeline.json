updating to wgpu 23, Bevy crashes on iOS with `fatal runtime error: Rust cannot catch foreign exceptions`\r\n\r\nThis started with https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/pull/6107\r\n\r\nBy adding logging between all lines of code in the `get_metal_layer`, it came from\r\nhttps://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/blob/ae6c6fbea4ee9dff911961512f128cfbfadb02b9/wgpu-hal/src/metal/surface.rs#L226\r\n\r\nnew_layer is a `CAMetalLayer` which is available on iOS https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/cametallayer\r\nbut `autoresizingMask ` is only available on macOS https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/1410877-autoresizingmask\r\n\r\nthis PR stops setting the `autoresizingMask` on iOS\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nI tested the same fix on the 23 tag with Bevy and it works\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [x] Run `cargo fmt`.\r\n- [x] Run `taplo format`.\r\n- [x] Run `cargo clippy`. If applicable, add:\r\n  - [ ] `--target wasm32-unknown-unknown`\r\n  - [ ] `--target wasm32-unknown-emscripten`\r\n- [ ] Run `cargo xtask test` to run tests.\r\n- [ ] Add change to `CHANGELOG.md`.
