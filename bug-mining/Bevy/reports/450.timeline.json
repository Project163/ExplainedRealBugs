I already have in place code to render a secondary camera to an offscreen buffer; however, that secondary camera is rendering the entire screen, when ideally it should only render a tiny section of the screen. This will require modifying both the perspective transform and the frustum of the secondary camera.\r\n\r\nFor portals, specifically, there's an additional requirement that I didn't mention, which is that the near plane of the frustum needs to be adjusted to align with the portal aperture, so that objects that are in front of the portal (that is, between the secondary camera and the target viewpoint) do not get included in the view. In my old three.js code, I used a auxiliary clipping plane for this, but Bevy doesn't have that feature.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2004603878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"viridia","id":1166135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjYxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1166135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia","html_url":"https://github.com/viridia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viridia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2067655104","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12488#issuecomment-2067655104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12488","id":2067655104,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U857PenA","user":{"login":"inodentry","id":40234599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjM0NTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40234599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry","html_url":"https://github.com/inodentry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inodentry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-20T12:12:59Z","updated_at":"2024-04-20T12:14:17Z","body":"I would like to add another use case that could benefit from this: screen shake in 3D.\r\n\r\nIf you want to shake the camera in 2D, you can just translate the camera along x/y, it's simple.\r\n\r\nBut in 3D, there are many different ways to accomplish screen shake, which look different, and it can be an artistic choice which way to implement the effect:\r\n -
