Objective\r\n\r\nWhen looking through the changes #14782 would produce I noticed another lint (`clippy::use_self`) that should be quite neat here (and solves some of `unused_qualifications` cases already which is why I don't want to supply a PR for both at the same time.)\r\n\r\nIn a bunch of cases `Self` is already used near the suggestion to use `Self` of `use_self`. So I assume this is accepted code which this lint enforces further in the future.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdd `clippy::use_self` (and alphabetically sort its lints) and mostly `--fix` its way through the code. `cargo fmt` results in less lines for the same code afterwards. Also removed some empty lines here and there.\r\n\r\nI also manually fixed the false-negative https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/12381 in the cases I noticed.\r\n\r\n`--fix` didn't work in `bevy_ecs` which turned out to be a clippy false-positive: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/13277\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n`cargo clippy` still seems to be happy. `cargo run -p ci` seems to work too. (It produces some errors of this kind, but it doesn't seem relevant for this PR: `Could not set global logger and tracing subscriber as they are already set. Consider disabling LogPlugin.`)\r\n\r\nReviewing this is probably quite messy as this changes hundreds of files. This will likely also produce many merge conflicts. I am happy to integrate other merged branches for some time if interest in merging this is there. But similar to #10749 it shouldn't stay open for too long due to its amount of affected files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14798/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14798/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13936352379,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86TPvwzzwAAAAM-q9x7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13936352379","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a6d233981d573686b9c4359eb6f165a6024d532f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/a6d233981d573686b9c4359eb6f165a6024d532f","created_at":"2024-08-19T22:02:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"EdJoPaTo","id":7953011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NTMwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7953011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdJoPaTo","html_url":"https://github.com/EdJoPaTo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdJoPaTo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdJoPaTo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdJoPaTo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdJoPaTo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdJoPaTo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdJoPaTo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdJoPaTo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdJoPaTo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EdJoPaTo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-19T23:12:32Z","updated_at":"2024-08-19T23:12:32Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14828","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14828/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14828/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14828/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/14828","id":2474412898,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U854yrys","number":14828,"title":"Apply

Also tried to figure out the false-positive (see review comment). Maybe split this PR up into multiple parts where only the last one enables the lint, so some can already be merged resulting in less many files touched / less potential for merge conflicts?\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are some cases where it might be easier to read the code with the qualifier, so perhaps remove the import of it and adapt its cases? In the current stage it's just a plain adoption of the suggestions in order to have a base to discuss.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n`cargo clippy` and `cargo run -p ci` are happy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13959910959,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86TPvwzzwAAAANAE1Yv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13959910959","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"938d810766d34f1a300beb440273c3db1635ee5c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/938d810766d34f1a300beb440273c3db1635ee5c","created_at":"2024-08-21T12:45:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13959911212,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86TPvwzzwAAAANAE1cs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/13959911212","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-21T12:45:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
