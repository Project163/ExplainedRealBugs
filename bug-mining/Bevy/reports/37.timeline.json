is an implementation of RFC #51: https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/51-animation-composition.md\r\n\r\nNote that the implementation strategy is different from the one outlined in that RFC, because two-phase animation has now landed.\r\n\r\n# Objective\r\n\r\nBevy needs animation blending. The RFC for this is [RFC 51].\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation of the RFC. Note that the implementation strategy is different from the one outlined there, because two-phase animation has now landed.\r\n\r\nThis is just a draft to get the conversation started. Currently we're missing a few things:\r\n\r\n- [x] A fully-fleshed-out mechanism for transitions\r\n- [x] A serialization format for `AnimationGraph`s\r\n- [x] Examples are broken, other than `animated_fox`\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n\r\n* The `AnimationPlayer` has been reworked to support blending multiple animations together through an `AnimationGraph`, and as such will no longer function unless a `Handle<AnimationGraph>` has been added to the entity containing the player. See [RFC 51] for more details.\r\n\r\n* Transition functionality has moved from the `AnimationPlayer` to a new component, `AnimationTransitions`, which works in tandem with the `AnimationGraph`.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n* `AnimationPlayer`s can no longer play animations by themselves and need to be paired with a `Handle<AnimationGraph>`. Code that was using `AnimationPlayer` to play animations will need to create an `AnimationGraph` asset first, add a node for the clip (or clips) you want to play, and then supply the index of that node to the `AnimationPlayer`'s `play` method.\r\n\r\n* The `AnimationPlayer::play_with_transition()` method has been removed and replaced with the `AnimationTransitions` component. If you were previously using `AnimationPlayer::play_with_transition()`, add all animations that you were playing to the `AnimationGraph`, and create an `AnimationTransitions` component to manage the blending between them.\r\n\r\n[RFC 51]: https://github.com/bevyengine/rfcs/blob/main/rfcs/51-animation-composition.md\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11989/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":9,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11989/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
