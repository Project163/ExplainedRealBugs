I believe the issue here is caused by your two different loaders producing the same asset type `C`. In the extension-less asset PR, asset loader resolution will short-circuit file extensions in favour of asset type resolution when that information is available. This is effectively the inverse problem to having two asset loaders registered for the same file extension.\r\n\r\nI believe this can be fixed by amending [`AssetLoaders`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/e3126a494f4759d52f2492559d3f585a41a4ce29/crates/bevy_asset/src/server/mod.rs#L1239-L1245) to store a list of `MaybeAssetLoader`'s in `type_id_to_loader` and select 1 (probably last added). Then during [asset loader resolution](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/e3126a494f4759d52f2492559d3f585a41a4ce29/crates/bevy_asset/src/server/mod.rs#L1057-L1092) check if there are multiple loaders for that type, and then use the file extension to attempt to break the deadlock.\r\n\r\nI'm terribly sorry this popped up for you, I'll make a PR based on my outline here and hopefully get that fixed soon!","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1920508465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-01T07:22:57Z","updated_at":"2024-02-01T07:22:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11644","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11644/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11644/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11644/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/11644","id":2111736231,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U85lqJ5d","number":11644,"title":"Use

`AssetLoaders` to capture possibility of multiple `AssetLoader` registrations operating on the same `Asset` type, but different extensions.\r\n- Added an algorithm which will attempt to resolve via `AssetLoader` name, then `Asset` type, then by extension. If at any point multiple loaders fit a particular criteria, the next criteria is used as a tie breaker.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11644/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11644/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"NiklasEi","id":12236672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjM2Njcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12236672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasEi","html_url":"https://github.com/NiklasEi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasEi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasEi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasEi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasEi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasEi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasEi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasEi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasEi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NiklasEi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-04T20:51:25Z","updated_at":"2024-02-04T20:51:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NiklasEi/bevy_common_assets/issues/28","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NiklasEi/bevy_common_assets","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NiklasEi/bevy_common_assets/issues/28/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NiklasEi/bevy_common_assets/issues/28/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NiklasEi/bevy_common_assets/issues/28/events","html_url":"https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_common_assets/pull/28","id":2116634748,"node_id":"PR_kwDOHQ9ybM5l7FzI","number":28,"title":"Update
