not visible when they should be.\n\n## Additional information\n\nAs they are only missing for a few frames it is difficult to take a screenshot but here is a short screen capture where the missing cubes can be seen as they come into view from the top of the frame.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58e0be83-d8ad-43d6-9aa2-ea7f44fd732b","closed_by":{"login":"superdump","id":302146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump","html_url":"https://github.com/superdump","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17759/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
