Objective\r\n\r\n- This is an adopted version of #10420\r\n- The objective is to help debugging the Ui layout tree with helpful outlines, that can be easily enabled/disabled\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Like #10420, the solution is using the bevy_gizmos in outlining the nodes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n### Added\r\n- Added debug_overlay mod to `bevy_dev_tools`\r\n- Added bevy_ui_debug feature to `bevy_dev_tools`\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n- The user must use `bevy_dev_tools` feature in TOML\r\n- The user must use the plugin UiDebugPlugin, that can be found on `bevy::dev_tools::debug_overlay`\r\n- Finally, to enable the function, the user must set `UiDebugOptions::enabled` to true\r\nSomeone can easily toggle the function with something like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn toggle_overlay(input: Res<ButtonInput<KeyCode>>, options: ResMut<UiDebugOptions>) {\r\n   if input.just_pressed(KeyCode::Space) {\r\n      // The toggle method will enable if disabled and disable if enabled\r\n      options.toggle();\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this feature can be disabled from dev_tools, as its in fact behind a default feature there, being the feature bevy_ui_debug.\r\n\r\n# Limitations\r\nCurrently, due to limitations with gizmos itself, it's not possible to support this feature to more the one window, so this tool is limited to the primary window only.\r\n\r\n# Showcase\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/126117294/ce9d70e6-0a57-4fa9-9753-ff5a9d82c009)\r\nUi example with debug_overlay enabled\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/assets/126117294/e945015c-5bab-4d7f-9273-472aabaf25a9)\r\nAnd

Start with an example that has a UI, such as https://bevyengine.org/examples/games/game-menu/\n2. Run it - it works and shows the Menu with the buttons\n3. Add a system that adds a second camera at startup. Specify the camera order to avoid ambiguities and a marker type to distinguish it.\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct SillyCameraMarker{}\n\n// System that sets up an inactive camera.\nfn setup_inactive_camera(mut commands: Commands) {\n    // https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/2d/camera.html\n    let camera = (\n        Camera2d,\n        SillyCameraMarker{},\n        Camera {\n            // higher order means rendered on top.\n            order: 2,\n            // clearcolor None to avoid hiding what the first camera shows.\n            clear_color: ClearColorConfig::None,\n            // TODO: Bug in bevy?: is_active:false disables my main menu.\n            is_active: true,\n            ..default()\n        },\n    );\n\n    commands.spawn((\n        camera,\n    ));\n}\n\n```\n5. Add the system to `game::game_plugin()`:  \n```rust\napp.add_systems(Startup, crate::setup_inactive_camera);\n``` \n6. Run it. Everything still works. This means to me that setting the `clear_color` works. (But maybe I misunderstood something there. Because if I don't specify the `ClearColorConfig::None`, the active camera does not hide the content either)\n7. Change `is_active`  to `false`  instead of `true`.\n8. Run it. There is just a blank screen, no Buttons.\n9. Change the camera order of the first camera to 4, so it is now in front of our newly-added inactive camera.\n10. The buttons show up again!\n\nThis all seems complex enough to probably be a beginner's mistake..., but then I would expect the active camera to also break the menu.\n\nI can explicitly specify the `RenderLayers` as a separate layer, such as `3`, but that does not change anything: The active camera still keeps everything working, the inactive camera still breaks the menu.\n\n## What went wrong\n\n### what were you expecting?\nThat the Menu Buttons are not affected by a second camera which is set to inactive and has `clear_color: ClearColorConfig::None`.\n\n### what actually happened?\nThe second camera breaks the menu if I set it to inactive.\n\n\n## Additional information\n\nPerhaps this is related:\n \n* https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11377\n  > The actual API will not return a warn or something, it will almost randomly pick one of the cameras. The camera depends on the camera order, the line is as follow\n\n* https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17530\n  * That issue was also opened by me and it also has to do with a second camera. So if this is a mistake on my part, so might be the other issue.\n\nI am attaching the code I used for reproducing this. The problematic `is_active`  is on line 785.\n\n[mainmenucam.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18550921/mainmenucam.zip)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17546/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
