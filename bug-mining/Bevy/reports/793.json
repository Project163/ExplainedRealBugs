Bevy version\n\nbevy `0.16.0-rc.3`\nwith bevy_pbr `0.16.0-rc.4`\n\n## What you did\n\nDespawning a `Mesh` in the `Last` schedule at a later time as spawning.\n\nMinimal code:\n```rust\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main(){\n    let mut app = App::new();\n    app .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_systems(Startup,startup)\n        .add_systems(Last,despawn)\n        .run();\n}\n\nfn startup(\n    mut cmd: Commands,\n    mut ass: ResMut<Assets<Mesh>>,\n    mut ase: ResMut<Assets<StandardMaterial>>\n){\n    cmd.spawn((\n        Transform::from_xyz(0.,0.,5.),\n        Camera3d::default(),\n    ));\n    cmd.spawn((\n        Mesh3d(ass.add(Cuboid::new(1.,1.,1.))),\n        MeshMaterial3d(ase.add(Color::srgb(1.,0.,0.)))\n    ));\n    cmd.spawn(DirectionalLight{\n        shadows_enabled: true,\n        ..default()\n    });\n}\n\n// despawn after 2 seconds\nfn despawn(\n    mut cmd: Commands,\n    query: Query<Entity,With<Mesh3d>>,\n    time: Res<Time>,\n    mut delay: Local<f32>\n){\n    *delay += time.delta_secs();\n    if *delay < 2. {return}\n    for e in &query {\n        cmd.entity(e).despawn();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## What went wrong\n\nRunning it (on linux `6.13.8-arch1-1` btw) always panics here:\n```\nthread 'Compute Task Pool (23)' panicked at ~/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/bevy_pbr-0.16.0-rc.4/src/material.rs:1014:79:\ncalled `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\nEncountered a panic in system `bevy_pbr::material::specialize_material_meshes<bevy_pbr::pbr_material::StandardMaterial>`!\n```\n\nIf a `DirectionalLight` with enabled shadows is present, it also panics here:\n```\nthread 'Compute Task Pool (15)' panicked at ~/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/bevy_pbr-0.16.0-rc.4/src/render/light.rs:1820:84:\ncalled `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value\nEncountered a panic in system `bevy_pbr::render::light::specialize_shadows<bevy_pbr::pbr_material::StandardMaterial>`!\n```\n\n## Additional information\n\n- It's easily avoidable by despawning in any schedule before `Last`.\n- but afaik: this worked in bevy_pbr `0.16.0-rc.3`\n","closed_by":{"login":"superdump","id":302146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/302146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump","html_url":"https://github.com/superdump","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/superdump/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18809/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
