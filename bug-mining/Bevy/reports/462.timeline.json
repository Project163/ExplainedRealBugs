Objective\r\n\r\nAdd support for events that can be triggered from animation clips. This is useful when you need something to happen at a specific time in an animation. For example, playing a sound every time a characters feet hits the ground when walking.\r\n\r\nCloses #15494 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdded a new field to `AnimationClip`: `events`, which contains a list of `AnimationEvent`s. These are automatically triggered in `animate_targets` and `trigger_untargeted_animation_events`. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAdded a couple of tests and example (`animation_events.rs`) to make sure events are triggered when expected.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n`Events` need to also implement `AnimationEvent` and `Reflect` to be used with animations.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Event, AnimationEvent, Reflect)]\r\nstruct SomeEvent;\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvents can be added to an `AnimationClip` by specifying a time and event.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// trigger an event after 1.0 second\r\nanimation_clip.add_event(1.0, SomeEvent);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd optionally, providing a target id.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet id = AnimationTargetId::from_iter([\"shoulder\", \"arm\", \"hand\"]);\r\nanimation_clip.add_event_to_target(id, 1.0, HandEvent);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI modified the `animated_fox` example to show off the feature.\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2024-10-05 at 02 41 57](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bb47db7-24f9-4504-88f1-40e375b89b1b)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15538/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15538/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14530204398,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86YPul9zwAAAANiEVLu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14530204398","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d9190e4ff63eb1dbc6cc29122d0f84149ee7d4b6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/d9190e4ff63eb1dbc6cc29122d0f84149ee7d4b6","created_at":"2024-10-06T10:19:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14530204431,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86YPul9zwAAAANiEVMP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/14530204431","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-06T10:19:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
