Objective\r\n\r\nWith the current implementation of `Plane3d` gizmos, it's really hard to get a good feeling for big planes. Usually I tend to add more axes as a user but that doesn't scale well and is pretty wasteful. It's hard to recognize the plane in the distance here. Especially if there would've been other rendered objects in the scene\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b65b7015-c08c-46d7-aa27-c7c0d49b2021)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n-  Since we got grid gizmos in the mean time, I went ahead and just reused them here.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI added an instance of the new `Plane3D` to the `3d_gizmos.rs` example. If you want to look at it you need to look around a bit. I didn't position it in the center since that was too crowded already.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4982afe-7296-416c-9801-7dd85cd975c1)\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThe optional builder methods on \r\n\r\n```rust\r\n\r\ngizmos.primitive_3d(&Plane3d { }, ...);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nchanged from\r\n\r\n- `segment_length`\r\n- `segment_count`\r\n- `axis_count`\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n- `cell_count`\r\n- `spacing`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14650/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14650/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"RobWalt","id":26892280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODkyMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26892280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt","html_url":"https://github.com/RobWalt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-08T12:14:13Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T12:14:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14656","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14656/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14656/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/14656/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/14656","id":2455644700,"node_id":"PR_kwDODf6-U8531EYy","number":14656,"title":"Switch rotation & translation in grid gizmos","user":{"login":"RobWalt","id":26892280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODkyMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26892280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt","html_url":"https://github.com/RobWalt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RobWalt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1795619323,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzk1NjE5MzIz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Bug","name":"C-Bug","color":"d73a4a","default":false,"description":"An unexpected or incorrect behavior"},{"id":2747865511,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzQ3ODY1NTEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Final-Review","name":"S-Ready-For-Final-Review","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This PR has been approved by the community.

Objective\r\n\r\n- Solves the last bullet in and closes #14319\r\n- Make better use of the `Isometry` types\r\n- Prevent issues like #14655\r\n- Probably simplify and clean up a lot of code through the use of Gizmos as well (i.e. the 3D gizmos for cylinders circles & lines don't connect well, probably due to wrong rotations)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- go through the `bevy_gizmos` crate and give all methods a slight workover\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- For all the changed examples I run `git switch main && cargo rr --example <X> && git switch <BRANCH> && cargo rr --example <X>` and compare the visual results\r\n- Check if all doc tests are still compiling\r\n- Check the docs in general and update them !!! \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThe gizmos methods function signature changes as follows:\r\n\r\n- 2D\r\n  - if it took `position` & `rotation_angle` before -> `Isometry2d::new(position, Rot2::radians(rotation_angle))`\r\n  - if it just took `position` before -> `Isometry2d::from_translation(position)`\r\n- 3D\r\n  - if it took `position` & `rotation` before -> `Isometry3d::new(position, rotation)`\r\n  - if it just took `position` before ->
