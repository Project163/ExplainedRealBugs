It's a bit confusing considering the type has Writer in it's name. Renaming it to `.write()` would remove this confusion. Also, it might help indicate a bit better that the `EventWriter` will not instantly send the event.\n\n## What solution would you like?\n\nRename `EventWriter::send()` to `EventWriter::write()` and do the same for `.send_default()`.\n\nDeprecate `.send()` and `.send_default()`\n\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\n\nJust deal with the inconsistency\n\n## Additional context\n\nI don't often use events, but every time I do I end up writing `.write()` because that's what the type is called.\n\nI made a poll on discord and at the moment of writing this issue it has 16 votes to rename it to `.write()` and only 1 vote to rename it to `EventSender` instead.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17856/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
