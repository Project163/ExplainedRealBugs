Implementation Plan\n\nI'll implement this feature by adding a `From<Uuid>` trait implementation for `Handle<A>`.\n\n**Proposed changes:**\n\n1. Add the following implementation to `crates/bevy_asset/src/handle.rs` (after the existing `From` implementations around line 268):\n\n```rust\nimpl<A: Asset> From<Uuid> for Handle<A> {\n    fn from(uuid: Uuid) -> Self {\n        Handle::Uuid(uuid, PhantomData)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Add comprehensive tests in the existing test module to ensure:\n   - Conversion from Uuid works correctly\n   - The resulting handle is a Uuid variant\n   - The handle ID matches the input UUID\n\n3. Run all quality checks (format, clippy, tests) to ensure compliance with project standards.\n\nThis will allow users to write cleaner code when creating handles from runtime UUIDs:\n```rust\nlet uuid = Uuid::new_v4();\nlet handle: Handle<Image> = uuid.into();  // Clean and ergonomic\n```\n\nInstead of the current verbose approach:\n```rust\nlet handle = Handle::<Image>::Uuid(uuid, PhantomData);  // Verbose\n```\n\nI'll open a PR with these changes

PhantomData);\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n- Added comprehensive test `from_uuid` that verifies:\n  - Conversion from `Uuid` to `Handle<A>` works correctly\n  - The resulting handle is a UUID variant\n  - The handle ID matches the input UUID\n  - Both `.into()` and explicit `From::from()` work\n- All existing handle tests continue to pass\n- Clippy and formatting checks pass","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21394/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3373431589","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21349#issuecomment-3373431589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21349","id":3373431589,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U87JEnsl","user":{"login":"andriyDev","id":22285953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22285953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev","html_url":"https://github.com/andriyDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-06T19:02:53Z","updated_at":"2025-10-06T19:02:53Z","body":"Can I understand more about your use case? Why do you need UUIDs for dynamically generated server assets?  UUIDs seem like a strange hammer for that since that UUID is probably gonna need to be passed around if it's truly dynamic, and then why not just pass a handle around that you get from `Assets::add` or `Assets::reserve_handle`?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3373431589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andriyDev","id":22285953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjg1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22285953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev","html_url":"https://github.com/andriyDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andriyDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":20145231998,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U87PTaJrzwAAAASwv9h-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20145231998","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6239e5cf3781828f05079affde08d64bfd30679f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/6239e5cf3781828f05079affde08d64bfd30679f","created_at":"2025-10-07T16:41:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20145232330,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U87PTaJrzwAAAASwv9nK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20145232330","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-07T16:41:45Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20146440851,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U87PTaJrzwAAAASw0kqT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/20146440851","actor":{"login":"tigregalis","id":38416468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NDE2NDY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38416468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigregalis","html_url":"https://github.com/tigregalis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigregalis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigregalis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigregalis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigregalis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigregalis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigregalis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tigregalis/
