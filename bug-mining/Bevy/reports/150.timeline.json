running empty schedules:\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::time::Instant;\r\n\r\nuse bevy_ecs::schedule;\r\nuse bevy_app::prelude::*;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let mut app = bevy_app::App::default();\r\n

app.add_schedule(schedule::Schedule::new(PostUpdate));\r\n    app.add_schedule(schedule::Schedule::new(Last));\r\n    let now = Instant::now();\r\n    for _i in 0..20_000_000 {\r\n        app.update();\r\n    }\r\n    println!(\"{}\", now.elapsed().as_micros() as f64 / 1e6);\r\n  \r\n}\r\n```\r\nPerformance table for this code:\r\nWith LTO = yes\r\nTest Case | Time | Slow Down\r\n-- |

Objective\r\n\r\n* Fixes #11932 (performance impact when stepping is disabled)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe `Option<FixedBitSet>` argument added to `ScheduleExecutor::run()` in #8453 caused a measurable performance impact even when stepping is disabled.  This can be seen by the benchmark of running `Schedule:run()` on an empty schedule in a tight loop (https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11932#issuecomment-1950970236).    \r\n\r\nI was able to get the same performance results as on 0.12.1 by changing the argument\r\n`ScheduleExecutor::run()` from `Option<FixedBitSet>` to `Option<&FixedBitSet>`.  The down-side of this change is that `Schedule::run()` now takes about 6% longer (3.7319 ms vs 3.9855ns) when stepping is enabled\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n* Change `ScheduleExecutor::run()` `_skipped_systems` from `Option<FixedBitSet>` to `Option<&FixedBitSet>`\r\n* Added a few benchmarks to measure `Schedule::run()` performance with various

Objective\r\n\r\nFix #11931 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Make stepping a non-default feature\r\n- Adjust documentation and examples\r\n  - In particular, make the breakout example not show the stepping prompt if compiled without the feature (shows a log message instead)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Removed `bevy_debug_stepping` from default features\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\nThe system-by-system stepping feature is now disabled by default; to use it, enable the `bevy_debug_stepping` feature explicitly:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[dependencies]\r\nbevy = { version = \"0.14\", features = [\"bevy_debug_stepping\"] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCode using [`Stepping`](https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/ecs/schedule/struct.Stepping.html) will still compile with the feature disabled, but will print a runtime error message to the console if the application attempts to enable stepping.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12847/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12347305881,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U85_mBJBzwAAAALf9O-Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12347305881","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eb82ec047e4e415f247ffc708df3f4d5464a1f69","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/eb82ec047e4e415f247ffc708df3f4d5464a1f69","created_at":"2024-04-03T19:31:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12347306027,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U85_mBJBzwAAAALf9PAr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12347306027","actor":{"login":"james7132","id":3137680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzc2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3137680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132","html_url":"https://github.com/james7132","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/james7132/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-03T19:31:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12366539961,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U85_mBJBzwAAAALhGmy5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12366539961","actor":{"login":"chompaa","id":26204416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjA0NDE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26204416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa","html_url":"https://github.com/chompaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chompaa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1dd48d1db6883d57b67ebe64f97eda033aafdcae","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chompaa/bevy/commits/1dd48d1db6883d57b67ebe64f97eda033aafdcae","created_at":"2024-04-05T01:38:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
