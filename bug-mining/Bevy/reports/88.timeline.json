Objective\r\n\r\n- Make running CI locally relatively less painful by allowing continuation after failure\r\n- Fix #12206 \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nPreviously, `ci` would halt after encounting a failure (or shortly thereafter). For instance, if you ran `cargo run -p ci` and a single test within a CI check failed somewhere in the middle, you would never even reach many of the other tests within the check and certainly none of the CI checks that came afterward. This was annoying; if I am fixing issues with CI tests, I want to just see all of the issues up-front instead of having to rerun CI every time I fix something to see the next error. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is not infrequent (because of subtle configuration/system differences) to encounter spurious CI failures locally; previously, when these occurred, they would make the process of running CI largely pointless, since you would have to push your branch in order to see your actual CI failures from the automated testing service. \r\n\r\nNow, when running `ci` locally, we have a couple new tools to ameliorate these and provide a smoother experience:\r\n- Firstly, there is a new optional flag `--keep-going` that can be passed while calling `ci` (e.g. `cargo run -p ci -- doc --keep-going`). It has the following effects:\r\n    - It causes the `--keep-going` flag to be passed to the script's `cargo doc` and `cargo check` invocations, so that they do not stop when they encounter an error in a single module; instead, they keep going (!) and find errors subsequently.\r\n    - It causes the `--no-fail-fast` flag to be passed to the script's `cargo test` invocations, to similar effect.\r\n    - Finally, it causes `ci` itself not to abort after a single check fails; instead, it will run every check that was invoked.\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, `cargo run -p ci -- --keep-going` will run every CI check even if it encounters intermediate failures, and every such check will itself be run to completion.\r\n\r\n- Secondly, we now allow multiple ordinary arguments to be passed to `ci`. For instance, `cargo -p ci -- doc test` now executes both the 'doc' checks and the 'test' checks. This allows the caller to run the tests they care about with fewer invocations of `ci`.\r\n\r\nAs of this PR, automated testing will remain unchanged. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- tools/ci/src/main.rs refactored into staging and execution steps, since the previous control flow did not naturally support continuing after failure.\r\n- Added \"--keep-going\" flag to `ci`.\r\n- Added support for invoking `ci` with multiple arguments.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\n### Design considerations\r\n\r\nI had originally split this into separate flags that controlled:\r\n1. whether `--keep-going`/`--no-fail-fast` would be passed to the constituent commands\r\n2. whether `ci` would continue after a component test failed\r\n\r\nHowever, I decided to merge these two behaviors, since I think that, if you're in the business of seeing all the errors, you'll probably want to actually see all of the errors. One slightly annoying thing, however, about the new behavior with `--keep-going`, is that you will sometimes find yourself wishing that the script would pause or something, since it tends to fill the screen with a lot of junk. I have found that sending stdout to /dev/null helps quite a bit, but I don't think `cargo fmt` or `cargo clippy` actually write to stderr, so you need to be cognizant of that (and perhaps invoke the lints separately). \r\n\r\n~~Next, I'll mention that I feel somewhat strongly that the current behavior of `ci` for automated testing should remain the same, since its job is more like detecting that errors exist rather than finding all of them.~~ (I was convinced this could have value.) Orthogonally, there is the question of whether or not we might want to make this (or something similar) actually the default behavior and make the automated test script invoke some optional flags — it doesn't have to type with its hands, after all. I'm not against that, but I don't really want to rock the boat much more with this PR, since anyone who looks at the diff might already be a little incensed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11996894837,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86A2tVRzwAAAALLEhZ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11996894837","actor":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-04T10:36:46Z","label":{"name":"S-Controversial","color":"d876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/1976279407","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12206#issuecomment-1976279407","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12206","id":1976279407,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U851y6Fv","user":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-04T10:39:12Z","updated_at":"2024-03-04T10:39:48Z","body":"The goal of CI is to fail fast in a case of errors, and to not do extra works when possible.\r\n\r\nChanging that would need more changes than just passing `--keep-going` everywhere: reducing dependency between jobs, not cancelling everything on the first job failed.
