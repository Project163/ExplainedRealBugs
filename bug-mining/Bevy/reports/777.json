This is just a newtype around u32, so `PartialEq` would be trivial. However, I think the macro `impl_reflect_opaque!` used in petgraph.rs might not add that one automatically.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18701/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
