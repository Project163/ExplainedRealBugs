Objective \r\n\r\nText2d doesn't respond to changes to the window scalefactor.\r\n\r\nFixes #16223\r\n\r\n## Solution \r\n\r\nIn `update_text2d_layout` store the previous scale factor in a `Local` instead and check against the current scale factor to detect changes.\r\n\r\nIt seems like previously the text wasn't updated because of a bug with the `WindowScaleFactorChanged` event and it isn't emitted after changes to the scale factor.  That needs to be looked into, but this will work for now.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nReally simple app that draws a big message in the middle of the window:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    App::new()\r\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\r\n        .add_systems(Startup, setup)\r\n        .run();\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands) {\r\n    commands.spawn(Camera2d);\r\n    commands.spawn((\r\n        Text2d::new(\"Hello\"),\r\n        TextFont {\r\n            font_size: 400.,\r\n            ..Default::default()\r\n        },\r\n    ));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks fine:\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"hello1\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5320746b-687e-4682-9e4c-bc43ab7ff9d3\">\r\n\r\nOn main, after changing the monitor's scale factor:\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"hello2\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/486cea16-fc44-4d66-9468-6f68905d4196\">\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this PR the text maintains the same size and position after the scale factor is changed.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15239685328,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86c3FmIzwAAAAOMWyTQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15239685328","actor":{"login":"BenjaminBrienen","id":42162869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTYyODY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42162869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminBrienen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminBrienen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-09T23:21:59Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Investigation","color":"D876E1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2469202236","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16223#issuecomment-2469202236","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16223","id":2469202236,"node_id":"IC_kwDODf6-U86TLQk8","user":{"login":"mockersf","id":8672791,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NzI3OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8672791?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf","html_url":"https://github.com/mockersf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mockersf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-11T22:35:16Z","updated_at":"2024-11-11T22:35:16Z","body":"@NiseVoid
