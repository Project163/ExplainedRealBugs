You are now only limited by Rust's recursion limit: around 1400 children at once.\nRejoice!\nIf you are spawning more than 1400 children in a single macro call, you should probably reconsider your strategy.\n\nWe've made the same change to the `related!` macro, allowing you to spawn huge numbers of related entities in a single call.\n```\n\nWe should make the changes requested in #21073 as part
