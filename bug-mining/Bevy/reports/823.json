A sprite's anchor is stored in the `anchor` field on `Sprite`.\n\nThis definitely seems like a really bad API choice, particularly since there's no warning if you add the `Anchor` component to a sprite entity. `Anchor` should either be a component or not. Suggestions:\n1. Remove the `anchor` field from `Sprite` and require `Anchor` instead.\n2. Remove the component derive from `Anchor` and add an `anchor` field to an existing text component\n3. Remove the component derive from `Anchor` and add a `TextAnchor` component newtyping `Anchor`.\n\nI favour option 1 since there aren't really any Text2d-specific components you can add the `Anchor` field to without messing up change detection. Option 3 is fine but feels redundant.\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/18367/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
