is an implementation within `bevy_window::window` that fixes #12229. \r\n\r\n# Objective\r\n\r\nFixes #12229, allow users to retrieve the window's size and physical size as Vectors without having to manually construct them using `height()` and `width()` or `physical_height()` and `physical_width()` \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAs suggested in #12229, created two public functions within `window`: `size() -> Vec` and `physical_size() -> UVec` that return the needed Vectors ready-to-go.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nMy first FOSS PRQ ever, so bear with me a bit. I'm new to this.\r\n\r\n- I replaced instances of ```Vec2::new(window.width(), window.height());``` or `UVec2::new(window.physical_width(), window.physical_height());` within bevy examples be replaced with their `size()`/`physical_size()` counterparts?\r\n- Discussion within #12229 still holds: should these also be added to WindowResolution?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11984894781,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86A9n6DzwAAAALKWvs9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11984894781","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cc32610543ff97794c3ee8ff7dd5ef58547a3ac5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/cc32610543ff97794c3ee8ff7dd5ef58547a3ac5","created_at":"2024-03-01T22:43:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11984894829,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86A9n6DzwAAAALKWvtt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/11984894829","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-01T22:43:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12062713618,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86A9n6DzwAAAALO_mcS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/12062713618","actor":{"login":"spectria-limina","id":118812919,"node_id":"U_kgDOBxTw9w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118812919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectria-limina","html_url":"https://github.com/spectria-limina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectria-limina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectria-limina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectria-limina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectria-limina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectria-limina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectria-limina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectria-limina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectria-limina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spectria-limina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5cf21656e3bcb6eca2a78efba762ae6262bfa4f0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spectria-limina/bevy/commits/5cf21656e3bcb6eca2a78efba762ae6262bfa4f0","created_at":"2024-03-09T08:36:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
