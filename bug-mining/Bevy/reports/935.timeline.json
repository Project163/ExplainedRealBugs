Objective\r\n\r\n- If an entity command is sent targeting a despawned entity, that command will error, and then panic by default.\r\n- This occurs even if the entity exists at the time the command was sent.\r\n- This can cause surprising panics when working with observers that depend on each other, especially when using entity events that cause entities to be despawned.\r\n- Closes #19623.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAs outlined in #19623, this behavior isn't exactly a bug, although it is surprising.\r\n\r\nWhen you attempt to trigger an observer for an entity that doesn't exist, Bevy should give you some indication that something has gone wrong!\r\n\r\nThe standard mechanism we have for doing so is to return an error in the command, which is passed to the default error handler. By default, this panics, reproducing the problem reported in #19623.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the error reporting was so bad that neither the OP nor the contributors could quickly isolate the problem and tell them what they should be doing differently.\r\n\r\nThe actual solution is both standard to the rest of Bevy and quite simple: just queue the command in a way that makes the error not panic. We should explain that!\r\n\r\nI've added commentary to that effect on both `EntityCommands::trigger/trigger_targets` and the error message returned.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI've added a new test demonstrating the fix for this failure mode. Swapping that test to plain `.trigger` fixes the problem.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20544/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-13T17:15:56Z","updated_at":"2025-08-13T17:15:56Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20552","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20552/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20552/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20552/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/20552","id":3318120655,"node_id":"I_kwDODf6-U87FxoDP","number":20552,"title":"Run `auto_register_static` example in CI","user":{"login":"eugineerd","id":70062110,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDYyMTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70062110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd","html_url":"https://github.com/eugineerd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eugineerd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2197761682,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk3NzYxNjgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/A-ECS","name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751","default":false,"description":"Entities, components, systems, and events"},{"id":3166092163,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTY2MDkyMTYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/C-Testing","name":"C-Testing","color":"b8b8b8","default":false,"description":"A change that impacts how we test Bevy or how users test their apps"},{"id":3166151441,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMTY2MTUxNDQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/labels/S-Ready-For-Implementation","name":"S-Ready-For-Implementation","color":"D876E3","default":false,"description":"This issue is ready for an implementation PR.

example](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/examples/reflection/auto_register_static) currently relies on some unspecified `rustc` compiler behavior that might change in the future, specifically:\n- proc macros execute in the same order as crates get compiled. This is needed for `load_type_registrations!` to work. (I don't think there are any plans to change that?)\n- proc macros aren't cached and execute exactly once every time a crate is recompiled. ([Cached proc macros](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/caching-of-proc-macro-expansions/21466))\n- proc macros have access to FS during execution.

Something is broken with the `std` `cfg` flags in `bevy_tasks`, likely originating in https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/20369.\n\nTo reproduce, run:\n\n```\ncargo test --package bevy_ecs --lib --all-features -- change_detection::tests::change_expiration --exact --show-output \n```\n\nCritically, this only occurs with all-features enabled.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/3186083416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19147048284,"node_id":"MEE_lADODf6-U87FqcKYzwAAAAR1QMVc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19147048284","actor":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-13T22:58:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19147048307,"node_id":"SE_lADODf6-U87FqcKYzwAAAAR1QMVz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19147048307","actor":{"login":"bushrat011899","id":2217286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTcyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2217286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899","html_url":"https://github.com/bushrat011899","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bushrat011899/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-13T22:58:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19147048325,"node_id":"MEE_lADODf6-U87FqcKYzwAAAAR1QMWF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/19147048325","actor":{"login":"NthTensor","id":16138381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MTM4Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16138381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor","html_url":"https://github.com/NthTensor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NthTensor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"
