What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nAfter #11439, it seems like it might be possible to nuke the [breakout example](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/examples/games/breakout.rs)'s custom collision code.\r\n\r\nThe breakout example makes use of [`bevy::sprite::collide_aabb::collide`](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/6a3b059db917999b15ca032a4cab8cd31569b896/crates/bevy_sprite/src/collide_aabb.rs) which exists in Bevy solely to make this particular example work.\r\n\r\nThe current collision code also assumes that the ball is a rectangle, which is no longer true!\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nReplace the code in `breakout` with code based on the new bounding volume intersection stuff introduced in #11439 and remove `bevy::sprite::collide_aabb::collide` from Bevy.\r\n\r\n`breakout` is relying on `collide_aabb::collide` determining \"which side of the thing was collided with,\" so this is slightly more involved than it sounds on the surface.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\nMaybe I've misjudged and it's not time for this yet.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/11479/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
