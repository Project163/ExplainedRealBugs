Objective\r\n\r\nDraw the UI debug overlay using the UI renderer.\r\n\r\nSignificantly simpler and easier to use than `bevy_dev_tools::ui_debug_overlay` which uses `bevy_gizmos`.\r\n* Supports multiple windows and UI rendered to texture.\r\n* Draws rounded debug rects for rounded UI nodes. \r\n\r\nFixes #16666\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nRemoved the `ui_debug_overlay` module from `bevy_dev_tools`.\r\n\r\nAdded a `bevy_ui_debug` feature gate.\r\n\r\nDraw the UI debug overlay using the UI renderer.\r\nAdds a new module `bevy_ui::render::debug_overlay`. \r\n\r\nThe debug overlay extraction function queries for the existing UI layout and then adds a border around each UI node with `u32::MAX / 2` added to each stack index so it's drawn on top. \r\n\r\nThere is a `UiDebugOptions` resource that can be used to enable or disable the debug overlay and set the line width.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe `testbed_ui` example has been changed to use the new debug overlay:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo run --example testbed_ui --features bevy_ui_debug\r\n```\r\n\r\nPress Space to toggle the debug overlay on and off.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Showcase\r\n\r\n<img width=\"961\"

from `bevy_dev_tools`.\r\nThere is a new debug overlay implemented using the `bevy_ui` renderer. To use it, enable the `bevy_ui_debug` feature and set the `enable` field of the `UiDebugOptions` resource to
