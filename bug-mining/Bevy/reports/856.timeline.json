Objective\r\n\r\nAdd specialized UI transform `Component`s and fix some related problems:\r\n* Animating UI elements by modifying the `Transform` component of UI nodes doesn't work very well because `ui_layout_system` overwrites the translations each frame. The `overflow_debug` example uses a horrible hack where it copies the transform into the position that'll likely cause a panic if any users naively copy it.\r\n* Picking ignores rotation and scaling and assumes UI nodes are always axis aligned.\r\n* The clipping geometry stored in `CalculatedClip` is wrong for rotated and scaled elements.\r\n* Transform propagation is unnecessary for the UI, the transforms can be updated during layout updates.\r\n* The UI internals use both object-centered and top-left-corner-based coordinates systems for UI nodes. Depending on the context you have to add or subtract the half-size sometimes before transforming between coordinate spaces. We should just use one system consistantly so that the transform can always be directly applied.\r\n* `Transform` doesn't support responsive coordinates.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n* Unrequire `Transform` from `Node`.\r\n* New components `UiTransform`, `UiGlobalTransform`:\r\n   - `Node` requires `UiTransform`, `UiTransform` requires `UiGlobalTransform`\r\n   - `UiTransform` is a 2d-only equivalent of `Transform` with a translation in `Val`s.\r\n   - `UiGlobalTransform` newtypes `Affine2` and is updated in `ui_layout_system`.\r\n* New helper functions on `ComputedNode` for mapping between viewport and local node space.\r\n* The cursor position is transformed to local node space during picking so that it respects rotations and scalings.\r\n* To check if the cursor hovers a node recursively walk up the tree to the root checking if any of the ancestor nodes clip the point at the cursor. If the point is clipped the interaction is ignored.\r\n* Use object-centered coordinates for UI nodes.\r\n* `RelativeCursorPosition`'s coordinates are now object-centered with (0,0) at the the center of the node and the corners at  (±0.5, ±0.5).\r\n* Replaced the `normalized_visible_node_rect: Rect` field of `RelativeCursorPosition` with `cursor_over: bool`, which is set to true when the cursor is over an unclipped point on the node. The visible area of the node is not necessarily a rectangle, so the previous implementation didn't work.\r\n\r\nThis should fix all the logical bugs with non-axis aligned interactions and clipping. Rendering still needs changes but they are far outside the scope of this PR.\r\n\r\nTried and abandoned two other approaches:\r\n* New `transform` field on `Node`, require `GlobalTransform` on `Node`, and unrequire `Transform` on `Node`. Unrequiring `Transform` opts out of transform propagation so there is then no conflict with updating the `GlobalTransform` in `ui_layout_system`. This was a nice change in its simplicity but potentially confusing for users I think, all the `GlobalTransform` docs mention `Transform` and having special rules for how it's updated just for the UI is unpleasently surprising.\r\n* New `transform` field on `Node`. Unrequire `Transform` on `Node`. New `transform: Affine2` field on `ComputedNode`.\r\nThis was okay but I think most users want a separate specialized UI transform components. The fat `ComputedNode` doesn't work well with change detection. \r\n\r\nFixes #18929, #18930\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThere is an example you can look at: \r\n```\r\ncargo run --example ui_transform\r\n```\r\n\r\nSometimes in the example if you press the rotate button couple of times the first glyph from the top label disappears , I'm not sure what's causing it yet but I don't think it's related to this PR.\r\n\r\n##  Migration Guide\r\nNew specialized 2D UI transform components `UiTransform` and `UiGlobalTransform`.  `UiTransform` is a 2d-only equivalent of `Transform` with a translation in `Val`s. `UiGlobalTransform` newtypes `Affine2` and is updated in `ui_layout_system`.\r\n`Node` now requires `UiTransform` instead of `Transform`. `UiTransform` requires `UiGlobalTransform`.\r\n\r\nIn previous versions of Bevy `ui_layout_system` would overwrite UI node's `Transform::translation` each frame. `UiTransform`s aren't overwritten and there is no longer any need for systems that cache and rewrite the transform for translated UI elements. \r\n\r\n`RelativeCursorPosition`'s coordinates are now object-centered with (0,0) at the the center of the node and the corners at  (±0.5, ±0.5). Its `normalized_visible_node_rect` field has been removed and replaced with a new `cursor_over: bool` field which is set to true when the cursor is hovering an unclipped area of the UI node.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/16615/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18061296822,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86z-C9fzwAAAAQ0iYS2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18061296822","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4836c7868ca36f3976c6b6fa9b33d90d04c8ccf7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/4836c7868ca36f3976c6b6fa9b33d90d04c8ccf7","created_at":"2025-06-09T19:24:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18061297002,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86z-C9fzwAAAAQ0iYVq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/18061297002","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-09T19:24:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
