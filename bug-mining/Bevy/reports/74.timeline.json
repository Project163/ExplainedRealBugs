concrete ones in `ReflectSerialize::get_serializable`.\r\n- Use `get_represented_type_info() -> type_id()` to get the correct type id to interact with the registry in `bevy_reflect::serde::ser::get_serializable`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n- Registering `ReflectSerialize` now imposes additional `FromReflect` and `TypePath` bounds.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n- If `ReflectSerialize` is registered on a type, but `TypePath` or `FromReflect` implementations are omitted (perhaps by `#[reflect(type_path = false)` or `#[reflect(from_reflect =
