What problem does this solve or what need does it fill?\r\n\r\nBevy's error messages for invalid inputs for systems and queries that take `SystemParam`,  `QueryData` or `QueryFilter` are terrible: users get a terrible error message saying that the trait isn't implemented for the whole tuple and suggesting a bunch of irrelevant tuples with generic types.\r\n\r\nFor upstream reports of what these errors look like, please see:\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89681\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89680\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/89679\r\n- https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/114247\r\n\r\n## What solution would you like?\r\n\r\nUse the soon-to-be-stabilized `diagnostic` attribute on our key traits, and manually provide more helpful error messages.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[diagnostic::on_unimplemented(\r\n    message = \"My Message for `ImportantTrait<{A}>` is not implemented for `{Self}`\",\r\n    label = \"My Label\",\r\n    note = \"Note 1\",\r\n    note = \"Note 2\"\r\n)]\r\ntrait ImportantTrait<A> {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/119888 is the stabilization PR which goes over more details of how this works: this will not be available until Rust 1.78.\r\n\r\n## What alternative(s) have you considered?\r\n\r\n1. Add variadic generics to upstream Rust (one day).\r\n2. Use a macro to determine these things that needs to be added to every system. [`bevy_check`](https://crates.io/crates/bevycheck/0.1.2) by @jakobhellermann does this, and is essential prior art.\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\n\r\nThis was brought to my attention by [George Semmler on Mastodon](https://elk.zone/mastodon.gamedev.place/@weiznich@social.weiznich.de/112059023846457822).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12377/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":7},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/12377/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
