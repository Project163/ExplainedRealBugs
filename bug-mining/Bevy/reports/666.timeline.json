adds support for one-to-many non-fragmenting relationships (with planned paths for fragmenting and non-fragmenting many-to-many relationships). \"Non-fragmenting\" means that entities with the same relationship type, but different relationship targets, are not forced into separate tables (which would cause \"table fragmentation\").\r\n\r\nFunctionally, this fills a similar niche as the current Parent/Children system. The biggest differences are:\r\n\r\n1. Relationships have simpler internals and significantly improved performance and UX. Commands and specialized APIs are no longer necessary to keep everything in sync. Just spawn entities with the relationship components you want and everything \"just works\".\r\n2. Relationships are generalized. Bevy can provide additional built in relationships, and users can define their own.\r\n\r\n**REQUEST TO REVIEWERS**: _please don't leave top level comments and instead comment on specific lines of code. That way we can take advantage of threaded discussions. Also dont leave comments simply pointing out CI failures as I can read those just fine._\r\n\r\n## Built on top of what we have\r\n\r\nRelationships are implemented on top of the Bevy ECS features we already have: components, immutability, and hooks. This makes them immediately compatible with all of our existing (and future) APIs for querying, spawning, removing, scenes, reflection, etc. The fewer specialized APIs we need to build, maintain, and teach, the better.\r\n\r\n## Why focus on one-to-many non-fragmenting first?\r\n\r\n1. This allows us to improve Parent/Children relationships immediately, in a way that is reasonably uncontroversial. Switching our hierarchy to fragmenting relationships would have significant performance implications. ~~Flecs is heavily considering a switch to non-fragmenting relations after careful considerations of the performance tradeoffs.~~ _(Correction from @SanderMertens: Flecs is implementing non-fragmenting storage specialized for asset hierarchies, where asset hierarchies are many instances of small trees that have a well defined structure)_\r\n2. Adding generalized one-to-many relationships is currently a priority for the [Next Generation Scene / UI effort](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/14437). Specifically, we're interested in building reactions and observers on top. \r\n\r\n## The changes\r\n\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Adds a generic one-to-many Relationship system\r\n3. Ports the existing Parent/Children system to Relationships, which now lives in `bevy_ecs::hierarchy`. The old `bevy_hierarchy` crate has been removed.\r\n4. Adds on_despawn component hooks\r\n5. Relationships can opt-in to \"despawn descendants\" behavior, meaning that the entire relationship hierarchy is despawned when `entity.despawn()` is called. The built in Parent/Children hierarchies enable this behavior, and `entity.despawn_recursive()` has been removed.\r\n6. `world.spawn` now applies commands after spawning. This ensures that relationship bookkeeping happens immediately and removes the need to manually flush. This is in line with the equivalent behaviors recently added to the other APIs (ex: insert).\r\n7. Removes the ValidParentCheckPlugin (system-driven / poll based) in favor of a `validate_parent_has_component` hook.\r\n\r\n## Using Relationships\r\n\r\nThe `Relationship` trait looks like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait Relationship: Component + Sized {\r\n    type RelationshipTarget: RelationshipTarget<Relationship = Self>;\r\n    fn get(&self) -> Entity;\r\n    fn from(entity: Entity) -> Self;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA relationship is a component that:\r\n\r\n1. Is a simple wrapper over a \"target\" Entity.\r\n2. Has a corresponding `RelationshipTarget` component, which is a simple wrapper over a collection of entities. Every \"target entity\" targeted by a \"source entity\" with a `Relationship` has a `RelationshipTarget` component, which contains every \"source entity\" that targets it.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the `Parent` component (as it currently exists in Bevy) is the `Relationship` component and the entity containing the Parent is the \"source entity\". The entity _inside_ the `Parent(Entity)` component is the \"target entity\". And that target entity has a `Children` component (which implements `RelationshipTarget`).\r\n\r\nIn practice, the Parent/Children relationship looks like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Relationship)]\r\n#[relationship(relationship_sources = Children)]\r\npub struct Parent(pub Entity);\r\n\r\n#[derive(RelationshipTarget)]\r\n#[relationship_sources(relationship = Parent)]\r\npub struct Children(Vec<Entity>);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Relationship and RelationshipTarget derives automatically implement Component with the relevant configuration (namely, the hooks necessary to keep everything in sync).\r\n\r\nThe most direct way to add relationships is to spawn entities with relationship components:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet a = world.spawn_empty().id();\r\nlet b = world.spawn(Parent(a)).id();\r\n\r\nassert_eq!(world.entity(a).get::<Children>().unwrap(), &[b]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are also convenience APIs for spawning more than one entity with the same relationship:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nworld.spawn_empty().with_related::<Children>(|s| {\r\n    s.spawn_empty();\r\n    s.spawn_empty();\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe existing `with_children` API is now a simpler wrapper over `with_related`. This makes this change largely non-breaking for existing spawn patterns.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nworld.spawn_empty().with_children(|s| {\r\n    s.spawn_empty();\r\n    s.spawn_empty();\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are also other relationship APIs, such as `add_related` and `despawn_related`.\r\n\r\n## Automatic recursive despawn via the new on_despawn hook\r\n\r\n`RelationshipTarget` can opt-in to \"despawn descendants\" behavior, which will despawn all related entities in the relationship hierarchy:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(RelationshipTarget)]\r\n#[relationship_sources(relationship = Parent, despawn_descendants)]\r\npub struct Children(Vec<Entity>);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that `entity.despawn_recursive()` is no longer required. Instead, just use `entity.despawn()` and the relevant related entities will also be despawned.\r\n\r\nTo despawn an entity _without_ despawning its parent/child descendants, you should remove the `Children` component first, which will also remove the related `Parent` components:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nentity\r\n    .remove::<Children>()\r\n    .despawn()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis builds on the on_despawn hook introduced in this PR, which is fired when an entity is despawned (before other hooks).\r\n\r\n## Relationships are the source of truth\r\n\r\n`Relationship` is the _single_ source of truth component. `RelationshipTarget` is merely a reflection of what all the `Relationship` components say. By embracing this, we are able to significantly improve the performance of the system as a whole. We can rely on component lifecycles to protect us against duplicates, rather than needing to scan at runtime to ensure entities don't already exist (which results in quadratic runtime). A single source of truth gives us constant-time inserts. This does mean that we cannot directly spawn populated `Children` components (or directly add or remove entities from those components). I personally think this is a worthwhile tradeoff, both because it makes the performance much better _and_ because it means theres exactly one way to do things (which is a philosophy we try to employ for Bevy APIs).\r\n\r\nAs an aside: treating both sides of the relationship as \"equivalent source of truth relations\" does enable building simple and flexible many-to-many relationships. But this introduces an _inherent_ need to scan (or hash) to protect against duplicates. [`evergreen_relations`](https://github.com/EvergreenNest/evergreen_relations) has a very nice implementation of the \"symmetrical many-to-many\" approach. Unfortunately I think the performance issues inherent to that approach make it a poor choice for Bevy's default relationship system. \r\n\r\n## Followup Work\r\n\r\n* Discuss renaming `Parent` to `ChildOf`. I refrained from doing that in this PR to keep the diff reasonable, but I'm personally biased toward this change (and using that naming pattern generally for relationships).\r\n* [Improved spawning ergonomics](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/discussions/16920)\r\n* Consider adding relationship observers/triggers for \"relationship targets\" whenever a source is added or removed. This would replace the current \"hierarchy events\" system, which is unused upstream but may have existing users downstream. I think triggers are the better fit for this than a buffered event queue, and would prefer not to add that back.\r\n* Fragmenting relations: My current idea hinges on the introduction of \"value components\" (aka: components whose type _and_ value determines their ComponentId, via something like Hashing / PartialEq). By labeling a Relationship component such as `ChildOf(Entity)` as a \"value component\",  `ChildOf(e1)` and `ChildOf(e2)` would be considered \"different components\". This makes the transition between fragmenting and non-fragmenting a single flag, and everything else continues to work as expected.\r\n* Many-to-many support\r\n    * Non-fragmenting: We can expand Relationship to be a list of entities instead of a single entity. I have largely already written the code for this.\r\n    * Fragmenting: With the \"value component\" impl mentioned above, we get many-to-many support \"for free\", as it would allow inserting multiple copies of a Relationship component with different target entities.\r\n\r\nFixes #3742 (If this PR is merged, I think we should open more targeted followup issues for the work above, with a fresh tracking issue free of the large amount of less-directed historical context)\r\nFixes #17301\r\nFixes #12235 \r\nFixes #15299\r\nFixes #15308 \r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n* Replace `ChildBuilder` with `ChildSpawnerCommands`.\r\n* Replace calls to `.set_parent(parent_id)` with `.insert(Parent(parent_id))`.\r\n* Replace calls to `.replace_children()` with `.remove::<Children>()` followed by `.add_children()`. Note that you'll need to manually despawn any children that are not carried over.\r\n* Replace calls to `.despawn_recursive()` with `.despawn()`.\r\n* Replace calls to `.despawn_descendants()` with `.despawn_related::<Children>()`.\r\n* If you have any calls to `.despawn()` which depend on the children being preserved, you'll need to remove the `Children` component first.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17398/reactions","total_count":67,"+1":18,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":49,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17398/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15970549151,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86mjak-zwAAAAO36z2f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15970549151","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-17T02:22:57Z","label":{"name":"A-ECS","color":"c6a751"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15970549154,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86mjak-zwAAAAO36z2i","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15970549154","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-17T02:22:57Z","label":{"name":"C-Usability","color":"b8b8b8"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15970549160,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86mjak-zwAAAAO36z2o","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15970549160","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-17T02:22:57Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Design","color":"D876E3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15970549165,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86mjak-zwAAAAO36z2t","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/15970549165","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.

Objective\r\n\r\n- Fixes #17411\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- Deprecated `Component::register_component_hooks`\r\n- Added individual methods for each hook which return `None` if the hook is unused.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- CI\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n`Component::register_component_hooks` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. When implementing `Component` manually, also implement the respective hook methods on `Component`.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Before\r\nimpl Component for Foo {\r\n    // snip\r\n    fn register_component_hooks(hooks: &mut ComponentHooks) {\r\n            hooks.on_add(foo_on_add);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// After\r\nimpl Component for Foo {\r\n    // snip\r\n    fn on_add() -> Option<ComponentHook> {\r\n            Some(foo_on_add)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nI've chosen to deprecate `Component::register_component_hooks` rather than outright remove it to ease the migration guide. While it is in a state of deprecation, it must be used by `Components::register_component_internal` to ensure users who haven't migrated to the new hook definition scheme aren't left behind. For users of the new scheme, a default implementation of `Component::register_component_hooks` is provided which forwards the new individual hook implementations.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think this is a cleaner API to work with, and would allow the documentation for hooks to exist on the respective `Component` methods (e.g., documentation for `OnAdd` can exist on `Component::on_add`). Ideally, `Component::on_add` would be the hook itself rather than a getter for the hook, but it is the only way to early-out for a no-op hook, which is important for performance.\r\n\r\n## Migration Guide\r\n\r\n`Component::register_component_hooks` has been deprecated. If you are manually implementing the `Component` trait and registering hooks there, use the individual methods such as `on_add` instead for increased clarity.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/17685/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16199998243,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86mjak-zwAAAAPFmFsj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16199998243","actor":{"login":"github-merge-queue[bot]","id":118344674,"node_id":"BOT_kgDOBw3L4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-merge-queue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-merge-queue%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d0c0bad7b494a21becbf2dd65c555b1eddb0b7ad","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/commits/d0c0bad7b494a21becbf2dd65c555b1eddb0b7ad","created_at":"2025-02-05T19:48:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16199998464,"node_id":"CE_lADODf6-U86mjak-zwAAAAPFmFwA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16199998464","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-05T19:48:59Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16326575537,"node_id":"REFE_lADODf6-U86mjak-zwAAAAPNI8Wx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16326575537","actor":{"login":"mrchantey","id":25616826,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NjE2ODI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25616826?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey","html_url":"https://github.com/mrchantey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mrchantey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0926b202b0fbdf7d462a71f6430d2eed302735f1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mrchantey/bevy/commits/0926b202b0fbdf7d462a71f6430d2eed302735f1","created_at":"2025-02-17T02:53:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
