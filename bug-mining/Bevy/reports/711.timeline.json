If you just want it to print as a pointer (like NonNull does) then deferring the implementation to NonNull or to the existing `fmt::Pointer` implementation should be fine. If you want it to print like `Ptr(0x6248d6a57c80)`, then you need to do something like the following in `impl_ptr!`:\n```rust\nimpl<A: IsAligned> Debug for $ptr<'_, A> {\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {\n        f.debug_tuple(stringify!($ptr)).field(&self.0).finish()\n    }\n}\n```\nIf you want the debug to represent whether the pointer is aligned or unaligned, you could do the following:\n```rust\nimpl Debug for $ptr<'_, Aligned> {\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {\n        f.debug_tuple(stringify!($ptr))\n            .field(&self.0)\n            .field(&Aligned)\n            .finish()\n    }\n}\nimpl Debug for $ptr<'_, Unaligned> {\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {\n        f.debug_tuple(stringify!($ptr))\n            .field(&self.0)\n            .field(&Unaligned)\n            .finish()\n    }\n}\n```\nwhich does require that Aligned and Unaligned implement Debug, and prints `Ptr(0x6248d6a57c80, Aligned)`.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/comments/2678259953/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mysteriouslyseeing","id":61419567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNDE5NTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61419567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysteriouslyseeing","html_url":"https://github.com/mysteriouslyseeing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysteriouslyseeing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysteriouslyseeing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysteriouslyseeing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysteriouslyseeing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysteriouslyseeing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysteriouslyseeing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysteriouslyseeing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysteriouslyseeing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mysteriouslyseeing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16438675268,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86rIK8KzwAAAAPT0kdE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16438675268","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-24T22:21:21Z","label":{"name":"C-Feature","color":"b8b8b8"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16438675275,"node_id":"UNLE_lADODf6-U86rIK8KzwAAAAPT0kdL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16438675275","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-24T22:21:22Z","label":{"name":"S-Needs-Triage","color":"D876e3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16438675280,"node_id":"LE_lADODf6-U86rIK8KzwAAAAPT0kdQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/events/16438675280","actor":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-c
