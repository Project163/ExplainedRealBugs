doesn't have a render graph configured. Consider adding a `Camera2d` or `Camera3d` component, or manually adding a `CameraRenderGraph` component if you need a custom render graph.\n```\nThe confusing part is specifically \"Consider adding a `Camera2d` or `Camera3d` component\".\n\nBumping the version number from `0.16` -> `0.17` with the aforementioned features, `CamerRenderGraph` would be automatically inserted onto the entity with `Camera2d`. However, since these dependent features point to `bevy_camera` over `bevy_core_pipeline`, this message is now emitted despite inserting `Camera2d` in the example.","closed_by":{"login":"alice-i-cecile","id":3579909,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzk5MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3579909?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile","html_url":"https://github.com/alice-i-cecile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alice-i-cecile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bevyengine/bevy/issues/21090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
