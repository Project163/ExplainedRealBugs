+title: Remove default implementation of extend_from_iter from RelationshipSourceCollection
+pull_requests: [20255]
+---
+
+The `extend_from_iter` method in the `RelationshipSourceCollection` trait no longer has a default implementation. If you have implemented a custom relationship source collection, you must now provide your own implementation of this method.
+
+```rust
+// Before: method was optional due to default implementation
+impl RelationshipSourceCollection for MyCustomCollection {
+    // ... other required methods
+    // extend_from_iter was automatically provided
+}
+
+// After: method is now required
+impl RelationshipSourceCollection for MyCustomCollection {
+    // ... other required methods
+    fn extend_from_iter(&mut self, entities: impl IntoIterator<Item = Entity>) {
+        // Use your collection's native extend method if available
+        self.extend(entities);
+        // Or implement manually if needed:
+        // for entity in entities {
+        //     self.add(entity);
+        // }
+    }
+}
+```
