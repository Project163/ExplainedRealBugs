+
+`bevy_ui` now supports distinct border colors on each side of your UI nodes,
+controlled with the [`BorderColor`] component.
+This feature was borrowed from CSS, where it is commonly used to fake buttons with depth,
+but we're looking forward to seeing your creative designs.
+
+[`BorderColor`]: https://docs.rs/bevy/0.17.0-rc.1/bevy/prelude/struct.BorderColor.html
