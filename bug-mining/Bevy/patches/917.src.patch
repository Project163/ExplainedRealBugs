+
+When working with large hierarchies of game objects, coordinating the state of the entire tree can be frustrating.
+Bevy uses this pattern when working with transforms and visibility internally,
+but users have had to reinvent the wheel every time they wanted to use similar patterns.
+
+While this pain was most acute when working with [`RenderLayers`], this pattern is more broadly useful,
+and has been exposed to end users in the form of the [`HierarchyPropagatePlugin`].
+You might use this for synchronizing color and alpha values for "ghost" versions of previewed buildings,
+ensuring that all of the parts of a model are on the same render layer,
+or propagating font styles.
+
+This plugin has three generics:
+
+- `C: Component`: the type of component that should be propagated
+- `F: QueryFilter=()`: if set, only entities which match this filter will be affected by propagation
+- `R: Relationship = ChildOf`: the type of tree-like relationship to propagate down
+
+Each copy of this plugin will propagate components of type `C` down the hierarchy, along all entities which match the
+query filter of type `F`.
+With this plugin enabled for `C`, you can add a [`Propagate<C>`] component to add new components to all children,
+add a [`PropagateStop<C>`] component to stop propagation, or even use [`PropagateOver<C>`] to skip this entity during propagation.
+
+This is a very general tool: please let us know what you're using it for and we can continue to add examples to the docs!
