+TODO: grab images from 20434 PR description.
+
+Any good [procedural atmosphere] deserves a procedural sun to light it.
+To enable this, add the [`SunDisk`] component to your [`DirectionalLight`] entity.
+The sun will move with your light, playing nicely with any positioning or movement logic you've implemented.
+
+You can set both the `angular_size` and `intensity` of the sun disk, changing the size and brightness of the sun.
+We've included a convenient `SunDisk::EARTH` constant, to spare you the tricky experimental trigonometry.
+
+If you've ever stared directly at the sun in real life (not recommended), you'll also be familiar with a spreading glow
+that bleeds out into the nearby sky.
+This is an effect known as "bloom", which is enabled by adding the [`Bloom`] component to your camera entity.
