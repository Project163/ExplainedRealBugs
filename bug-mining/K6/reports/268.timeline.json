Feature Description\r\n\r\nWhen using multiple scenarios, you might want to have a quick way to run the test with or without a particular scenario.\r\n\r\nThe [suggested solution](https://community.k6.io/t/how-to-execute-single-scenario-out-of-multiple-scenarios-in-a-script/1573) is to use environment variables to edit the [scenarios object](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/k6-options/reference/#scenarios).\r\n\r\nA dummy example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst scenarios = {\r\n  scenario_1: {\r\n    executor: \"shared-iterations\",\r\n    iterations: 1,\r\n    vus: 1,\r\n  },\r\n  scenario_2: {\r\n    executor: \"shared-iterations\",\r\n    iterations: 1,\r\n    vus: 1,\r\n  },\r\n  scenario_3: {\r\n    executor: \"shared-iterations\",\r\n    iterations: 1,\r\n    vus: 1,\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n\r\nif (__ENV.SKIP_SCENARIO1) {\r\n  delete scenarios[\"scenario_1\"];\r\n}\r\nif (__ENV.SKIP_SCENARIO2) {\r\n  delete scenarios[\"scenario_2\"];\r\n}\r\nif (__ENV.SKIP_SCENARIO3) {\r\n  delete scenarios[\"scenario_3\"];\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const options = {\r\n  scenarios: scenarios,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Suggested Solution\r\n\r\n> Changed the initial proposal based on @pablochacin's suggestion\r\n\r\nProvide an [scenario common option](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/scenarios/#common-options) to toggle the scenario execution. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const options = {\r\n  scenarios: {\r\n    scenario_1: {\r\n      executor: \"shared-iterations\",\r\n      iterations: 1,\r\n      vus: 1,\r\n      skip: __ENV.SKIP_SCENARIO1,\r\n    },\r\n    scenario_2: {\r\n      executor: \"shared-iterations\",\r\n      iterations: 1,\r\n      vus: 1,\r\n      skip: __ENV.SKIP_SCENARIO2,\r\n    },\r\n    scenario_3: {\r\n      executor: \"shared-iterations\",\r\n      iterations: 1,\r\n      vus: 1,\r\n      skip: __ENV.SKIP_SCENARIO3,\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd/or using the CLI:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nk6 run --skip scenario_1,scenario_2 test.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Already existing or connected issues / PRs

What?\r\n\r\nWarn on shorthand options(vus, duration, stages, iterations) overriding scenarios from previously defined scenarios. Mostly applicable when using cli flags to override them from within the script.\r\n\r\nThis is currently implemented only for scenarios as that is the case that is most confusing. Implementing this for duration overriding stages (for example) is possible, but it seems to not be nearly hit enough.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately due to too many of things of #883 and the way shorthand options are handled in particular, the code can't be in any Apply function with enough information to have a nice message.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nThis is probably one of the things that confuses the most users as explained in the original #2529 issue.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nIf you haven't read the contributing guidelines https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
