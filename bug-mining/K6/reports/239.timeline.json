this check was only returning `false` if it also could emit it, and true otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis should rarely be a problem as the same context that is being checked here is the one that interrupts the VM - so no code will be able to run after this.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the code checking if it should be emitted is racing with the one that interrupts the VM. So it is possible for the VM to still not be interrupted when a `check` returns a wrong value. It is even possible for more code to be run before the interrupt is actually called.\r\n\r\nThe code still checks the context as this also updates the internal check structure and we don't want to that if the context is done. The above should be changed with #2869\r\n\r\nFixes
