It's been on the chopping block in my mind ever since the first person (internally) wrote `res.timings.x < y` in a check. If it's causing this much confusion internally with no clear use case, I'm terrified of what would happen if we released it to the public. It currently just seems to encourage people to shoot themselves in the foot and not even realize it.\r\n\r\n2. **How do we express time** when passing it to custom metrics? Go uses nanoseconds and has you multiply by unit constants (eg. `1*time.Second` or `1000*time.Millisecond`), and that's how thresholds temporarily do it (`100*ms`). Ruby instead has `1.second`. Does JS have a convention for how to handle times?
