spent some more time investigating this and there are some bad news and some good news... \r\n\r\nThe bad news is that there's no current workaround for the bug, basically once a binary response is treated as a utf-16 string, the information is lost. As an example, if I have create a \"string\" with all possible byte values:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nb := make([]byte, 256)\r\nfor i := 0; i <= 255; i++ {\r\n    b[i] = byte(i)\r\n}\r\nruntime := goja.New()\r\nruntime.Set(\"testStr\", string(b))\r\n```\r\n\r\nand I pass it to a goja runtime, where I dump the data in it by running a script like this:\r\n```js\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < testStr.length; i++) {\r\n    buffer.push(testStr.charCodeAt(i));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the values from 0 to 127 fine, but the rest are encoded as 65533, which is basically a replacement character that substitutes for corrupt UTF sequences... So no recovering the original data from that...\r\n\r\nBut the good news is that I think we can solve the issue with a relatively simple fix. We can add a new HTTP request `responseType` option that specifies how to receive the response body, similar to the browser [`XMLHttpRequest.responseType` option](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/responseType). By default it would be `text`, but if users supply `binary`, we'll return the original Go `[]byte` value. Of course we'd have to change the `HTTPResponse.Body` type from `string` to `interface{}`, but there shouldn't be any issues with that. \r\n\r\nThere may even be some benefits, for example we can return `null` when users have enabled the new `discardResponseBody` option (we use an empty string now, which could be somewhat confusing). We might even rename the new `discardResponseBody` option to instead be `responseType=none`, so we don't have 2 separate options.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/415012936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/415191241","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/748#issuecomment-415191241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/748","id":415191241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTE5MTI0MQ==","user":{"login":"sherrman","id":1403628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDM2Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1403628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherrman","html_url":"https://github.com/sherrman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherrman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherrman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherrman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherrman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherrman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherrman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherrman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherrman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sherrman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-22T21:44:19Z","updated_at":"2018-08-22T21:44:19Z","body":"That's awesome.

adds a new backwards-compatible request option called `responseType` with a default value of `text`, so by default response bodies would still be returned as strings.
