Brief summary\n\nWhen using the async version of setup() the return value of the function call does not create the data object that should be passed in to the default function.\r\n\r\nIf you change back to a non-async setup call then the data object is set correctly.\n\n### k6 version\n\n0.44\n\n### OS\n\nMac OS 13.1\n\n### Docker version and image (if applicable)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps to reproduce the problem\n\nexport async function setup() {\r\n    return {data: \"Arbitrary value here\"}\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default function (data) {\r\n    console.log(data)\r\n}\r\n\n\n###
