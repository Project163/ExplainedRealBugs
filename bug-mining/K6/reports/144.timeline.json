demonstrated by https://community.k6.io/t/warn-0000-error-getting-terminal-size/767 / https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1559, k6 has some troubles when running in \"git bash\" on Windows. We will fix the panic, but the user experience of k6 will never be quite as good there as on other terminals, so we probably should document something like the the following usage guidelines for windows:\r\n> If you're using [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or [mintty](https://mintty.github.io/) as your terminal on Windows, you might not get the best user experience out of k6. Consider using a different terminal like [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701), PowerShell or [Cmder](https://cmder.net/). Alternatively, to [work around](https://github.com/mintty/mintty/wiki/Tips#inputoutput-interaction-with-alien-programs) the issues, you can run k6 through [`winpty`](https://github.com/rprichard/winpty), which should already be preinstalled in your Git Bash environment: `winpty k6 run script.js`. \r\n>\r\n> If you're using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you are probably going to get better experience by using the Linux k6 binary above.\r\n>\r\n> For all other cases of running k6 on Windows, the normal k6 Windows binary / .msi package should work fine.\r\n\r\n(With the understanding that as soon as we have an official signed package for the windows package manager, that will be the recommended way to install k6.)\r\n\r\ncc @imiric

seems similar to https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1559 as it is unable to get the terminal width correctly, but 0.27.1 did not fix the issue in CodeFresh, and still crashes in the same way.  Reverting to 0.26.2 works as expected.\r\n\r\nAttempting to run any script on a k6 0.27.0 or 0.27.1 container in CodeFresh should see this behavior.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1579/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1579/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-31T08:06:21Z","updated_at":"2020-07-31T08:06:21Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1376","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1376/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1376/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1376/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/1376","id":590344637,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1OTAzNDQ2Mzc=","number":1376,"title":"Add

cases, examples, etc. -->\r\nIn #1332 we experimented with a `--ui-mode` option to change how the progress bars were rendered, but after some discussion we agreed that it was best leaving that option (or a similarly named one) to change how the entire UI is rendered, and not just progress bars.\r\n\r\n## Suggested Solution\r\n<!--- Any implementation suggestions you might have: technical details, design tradeoffs, API proposals, etc. -->\r\nOne possible value could be `log`, where instead of showing progress bars, k6 would output log messages, which might be useful for headless/CI environments.\r\n\r\nA related option to this might be `--ui-refresh-rate`, which would control the update frequency (currently hard-coded to 100ms).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1376/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
