Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\r\nIn v0.26.2 it was possible to scale `maxVUs` arbitrarily using the REST API or the helper `scale -m` command.\r\n\r\nOn the current `new-schedulers` branch (2f150f2e), it's only possible to scale `maxVUs` up, but not back down, and no errors are returned when attempting to do so.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n<!--- Provide as much information about your environment as possible: output from `k6 version`,\r\n      OCI runtime and image information if using containers, cloud execution environment, etc. -->\r\n- k6 version: `new-schedulers` (2f150f2e)\r\n- OS and version: Linux\r\n- Docker version and image, if applicable:\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what should happen -->\r\n- It should be possible to scale `maxVUs` down to the initial `maxVUs` setting.\r\n- Trying to scale `maxVUs` below the initial `maxVUs` setting should return an error. This is a slight breaking change from 1007 in order to allow VU sharing between executors.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\r\n`k6 scale -m N` where `N` is below the currently set `maxVUs` value (whether that was the initial value or one scaled up to with `k6 scale -m` previously) is silently ignored, and the executor remains with the previous value.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\n<!--- Provide the exact commands, environment variables and relevant script(s) to reproduce this bug. -->\r\n\r\n1. Given the following `script.js`:\r\n```js\r\nimport { sleep } from 'k6';\r\n\r\nexport let options = {\r\n  scenarios: {\r\n    adjustable_at_will: {\r\n      executor: \"externally-controlled\",\r\n      vus: 0,\r\n      maxVUs: 20,\r\n      duration: \"10m\",\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default function () {\r\n  sleep(1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Run `k6 run script.js`.\r\n3. In another terminal, run `k6 scale -m 50`. Note the `vus-max: \"50\"` in the output.\r\n4. Run `k6 scale -m 20`. Note that `vus-max` remains at `50`.\r\n5. Run `k6 scale -m 10`. Note that `vus-max` remains at `50` and no error is returned.\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure that the behavior of `scale -u` is also consistent, and returns errors in the same way as v0.26.2.","closed_by":{"login":"imiric","id":1009277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDkyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1009277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric","html_url":"https://github.com/imiric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1511/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
