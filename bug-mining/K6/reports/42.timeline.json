off, apologies for using an issue for questions - the Slack invite linked on k6.io states that it is no longer valid.\r\n\r\nI have a working script created with v0.12.2. Upon upgrading to v0.17.0 there are three major issues:\r\n\r\n1. `import { checkGet, checkPost, checkAuthenticate } from './general';` has to be changed to `import { checkGet, checkPost, checkAuthenticate } from './general.js';` (note the .js)\r\n2. `Object.assign` now results in `TypeError: Object has no member 'assign`\r\n3. I had been creating a `json_body` member of `res` (code below). The reason for doing this vs using `res.json()` is it makes it convenient to have a default empty {} object so downstream checks can validate against it. With `.json()` those checks would fail. This now results in `TypeError: Cannot assign to property json_body of a host object` however. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction getJsonBodyChecks(res, expectedContentType) {\r\n\tlet jsonBodyCheck = {};\r\n\t\r\n\tif('application/json' === expectedContentType) {\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tres.json_body = JSON.parse(res.body);\r\n\t\t} catch(e) {\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tjsonBodyCheck = {\r\n\t\t\t'body is JSON'\t: (r) => 'object' === typeof(r.json_body),\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn jsonBodyCheck;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ... down the line ...\r\nexport function checkGet(endpoint, additionalChecks = {}, expectedContentType='application/json' ) {\r\n\tconst res = http.get(\r\n\t\tEndpoints[endpoint], \r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\theaders : getBaseHeaders()\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t);\r\n\r\n\tconst allChecks = Object.assign(\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t'status was 200'\t\t\t: (r) => r.status === 200,\r\n\t\t\t'transaction time OK'\t\t: (r) => r.timings.duration < 200,\r\n\t\t\t'content-type OK'\t\t\t: (r) => r.headers['Content-Type'] && r.headers['Content-Type'].startsWith(expectedContentType),\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tgetJsonBodyChecks(res, expectedContentType),\r\n\t\tadditionalChecks\r\n\t);\r\n\r\n\tcheck(res, allChecks);\r\n\r\n\treturn res;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease advise on alternatives/workarounds!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
