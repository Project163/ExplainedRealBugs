Read operations are trickier, especially if there were many write operations since the last read operation. I try to test such a scenario using k6, as follows:\r\n1. `POST` 100 commands using 10 vus and 100 iterations, check the response status for each (group `POST requests`)\r\n2. `GET` once *after all `POST`s are done (group `GET request`)\r\n\r\nIssue description\r\n===\r\nTo accomplish the second part, I'm making the request in the `teardown` function and check the response status.\r\n\r\nExpected result\r\n===\r\n1. Result set should be compiled of two groups:\r\n1.1. `POST requests`: 100 checks\r\n1.2. `GET requests`: 1 check\r\n2. Total amount should be 101 checks\r\n\r\nActual results\r\n===\r\n1. Result set contains only the first group, 100 checks\r\n2. Total amount is 101 checks (correct)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6158608/54217830-0569b200-44f5-11e9-8118-1a2a0294839d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/949/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
