Feature Description\r\n\r\nIt could be useful to declare multiple [log outputs](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/options/#log-output) at the same time for `k6 run` and `cloud` commands.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nk6 run --logformat json \\\r\n    --log-output file=./k6run.log \\\r\n    --log-output loki=http://127.0.0.1:3100/loki/api/v1/push \\\r\n    ./samples/http_get.js\r\n```\r\nor a more advanced example\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nk6 run --verbose \\\r\n    --log-output \"stdout,level=info\" \\\r\n    --log-output \"file=all.log,level=debug\" \\\r\n    --log-output \"loki=http://whatever,level=warn\" \\\r\n    ./samples/http_get.js\r\n```\r\n#### Logformat\r\nIt could include the additional features for making more fine-grained `logformat` configuration considering that at the moment [logformat](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/options/#logformat) can be only defined at the global layer.\r\n* a per-output `logformat` option for a fine-grained definition of the format for the specific output\r\n\r\nAn example with the previous advanced example:\r\n```sh\r\nk6 run --verbose \\\r\n    --log-output \"stdout,level=info,format=raw\" \\\r\n    --log-output \"file=all.log,level=debug,format=json\" \\\r\n    --log-output \"loki=http://whatever,level=warn,format=json\" \\\r\n    ./samples/http_get.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Cloud\r\nThe cloud supports the `log-output` option and it shouldn't be confused as did during an internal discussion with [show logs option](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/options/#show-logs).\r\n\r\n>k6 has its own debug log messages that are not driven from the script console.log(), just run k6 run --verbose or k6 cloud --verbose with a script without any console.log() calls and you'll see them.\r\n\r\nso the following example is still a valid case:\r\n```sh\r\nk6 cloud --verbose --log-output \"file=debug.log\" --show-logs=false script.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Already existing or connected issues / PRs (optional)\r\n\r\n*
