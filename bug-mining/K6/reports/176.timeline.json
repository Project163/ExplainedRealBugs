more details, k6 doesn't deal well with complex types when it tries to urlencode them. It really can't deal with that, since there isn't a standard for how to encode maps and arrays into URL parameters for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` requests. PHP would have sent `topping` as `topping[]=onion&topping[]=bacon&topping[]=cheese`, for example, and as you say, other languages would have sent `topping=onion&topping=bacon&topping=cheese`. The same for maps, some libraries would format `obj: { a: \"b\", c: 4 },` as `obj[a]=b&obj[c]=4`, others as `obj.a=b&obj.c=4`. It's not specified in an RFC anywhere, so there are a bunch of possible right solutions.\r\n\r\nThough, as shown in https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/878, k6 would currently do something that is definitely wrong... :disappointed:  It would send something like `topping=%5Bonion+bacon+cheese%5D&obj=map%5Ba%3Ab+c%3A4%5D`, i.e. convert the complex types to their JS `String()` representation and send that. So maybe we should pick one of the conventions above and stick with it, even though it won't cover 100% of use cases? :man_shrugging:

we have this example k6 script:\r\n```js\r\nimport http from \"k6/http\";\r\n\r\nexport default function () {\r\n    let data = {\r\n        arr: [1, 2, 3, \"a\"],\r\n        str: \"test\",\r\n        obj: { a: \"b\", c: 4 },\r\n    };\r\n    let resp = http.post(\"https://httpbin.org/post\", data, { headers: { \"content-type\": \"application/json\" } });\r\n    console.log(resp.json().data);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMost people will expect it to print something like `{\"arr\":[1,2,3,\"a\"],\"str\":\"test\",\"obj\":{\"a\":\"b\",\"c\":4}}`, or to print a warning, or even fail with an error.\r\n\r\nInstead, k6 will silently do a stupid thing and actually assume that the content-type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, and thus try to urlencode the supplied object. Even that may have been fine, if there was a standard in for URL-encoding nested objects. But as far as I can see, there isn't an RFC for this, and and [only PHP supports string keys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30261513/is-there-a-spec-for-nested-urlencoded-params) in maps anyway. In the above example, k6 will actually print `arr=%5B1+2+3+a%5D&obj=map%5Ba%3Ab+c%3A4%5D&str=test`. Basically converts JS arrays and objects to strings and then just tacks them on, which is pretty much useless to everyone. To get the expected result, users have to manually pass `JSON.stringify(data)` instead of simply `data`.\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion is to specifically check if a request's body isn't a string or a binary payload and if its `content-type` is `application/json` and just automatically marshal the request body to
