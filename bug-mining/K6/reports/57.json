We use X509 auth heavily for our non-user-facing services so it'd be very useful, hopefully the underlying mechanics are in place already via the Go TLS lib.\r\n\r\nI guess it'd be best to be able to specify the client cert/key to use in the config (by path to files) per URL since they may well differ if the test is for e.g. a user journey simulation or covers >1 service for some reason.\r\n\r\nCheers","closed_by":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/206/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
