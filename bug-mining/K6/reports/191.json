[k6 API ](https://docs.k6.io/docs) does not provide an API to exit a load test.  The [fail](https://docs.k6.io/docs/fail-err) does not cover this case.\r\n\r\nA common workaround is to configure a [threshold that aborts the test](https://docs.k6.io/docs/thresholds#section-aborting-a-test-when-a-threshold-is-crossed) when the threshold is crossed.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { sleep } from \"k6\";\r\nimport http from \"k6/http\";\r\nimport { Counter } from \"k6/metrics\";\r\n\r\nexport let options = {\r\n    stages: [\r\n        { duration: \"30s\", target: 50 }\r\n    ],\r\n    thresholds: {\r\n        \"myThresholdMetric\": [{threshold: \"count<1\", abortOnFail: true}]\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst myThresholdMetric = new Counter(\"myThresholdMetric\");\r\n\r\nexport default function() {\r\n    http.get(\"https://test.loadimpact.com/\");\r\n    if (__VU === 1 && __ITER === 1) { \r\n        myThresholdMetric.add(1);\r\n    }\r\n    sleep(3);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut this or other workarounds have a few inconveniences or limitations:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The [Threshold](https://docs.k6.io/docs/thresholds) API works well for evaluating complex conditions but the API is not intuitive or simple when you want just to check a simple condition. \r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    if (condition) { \r\n        exit();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n2. It cannot `exit` the load test on a non-error mode. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nexit(0);\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. It cannot provide different `exit` codes. Related issue: [Different exit codes for different errors](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/870)\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexit(5);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n4. it cannot provide user message\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexit(10, “service was not available”);\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. The API should also work on the `setup/teardown` methods.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport function teardown(time) {\r\n    if (condition) { \r\n        exit(1);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `exit` API is a suggestion, but in any case, I think it could be a good addition if k6 provides an API to support these cases during local and cloud execution.  Some users have already asked for a similar utility.","closed_by":{"login":"imiric","id":1009277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDkyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1009277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric","html_url":"https://github.com/imiric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1001/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1001/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
