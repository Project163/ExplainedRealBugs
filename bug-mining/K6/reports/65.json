I also think it would be beneficial to have this implemented as a REST API endpoint (https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/tree/master/api/) so that one could communicate with the k6 REST API (we start k6 suspended in the cloud) to add blacklisted IPs/blocks.\r\n\r\nBefore trying to connect to a target system k6 should make sure that the IP is not in a blacklisted block. If it is, k6 should exit, with a non-zero exit code and log an error message with the following fields:\r\n\r\n- Offending IP\r\n- Blacklisted CIDR block that the offending IP is part of\r\n- URL of HTTP/WebSocket request/connection in question\r\n- Error message explaining the test termination\r\n\r\n@martinfijal Please add to this issue if there's something I've overlooked.","closed_by":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/389/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/389/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
