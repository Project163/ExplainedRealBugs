What?\r\n\r\nAdds an extensible secret sources. Basically #4139 but without http secret source as that turned out to have too many configuration problems. But it has a mock secret source which basically gets them form the cli arguments - probably should be renamed.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport secrets from \"k6/secrets\";\r\n\r\nexport default async () => {\r\n\tconst my_secret = await secrets.get(\"cool\"); // get secret from a source with the provided identifier\r\n\tconsole.log(my_secret);\r\n\tawait secrets.get(\"else\"); // get secret from a source with the provided identifier\r\n\tconsole.log(my_secret);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo run . run --secret-source=mock=cool=some,else=source script.js\r\n```\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d35f56d-ad69-42be-9fc3-74efa58eb88c)\r\n\r\nor with a secret file:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncool=some\r\nelse=source\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ngo run . run --secret-source=file=file.secret script.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe extension points are under ./secretsource and mostly around the `Get` method which gets a secret and returns it.\r\n\r\nThe rest of k6 makes certain to not request it again and redact it from logs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Should we throw an exception or return `undefined` on errors, or at least on not found secrets. I currently think having an exception lets sources have specific errors potentially helping with debugging. But maybe logging the error is good enough :shrug: \r\n- [X] Multiple secret sources is almost done but not quite\r\n- [X] Unit Tests and likely some integration ones will be nice - although I do plan to add some more.\r\n- [ ] ~Have HTTP secret source? Maybe for later version~ this seems to have way too many moving pieces to be a good idea for first versions\r\n- [ ] Configuration currently only happens from CLI flags which might not be ideal ~~and is definitely problematic as `,` is special, so you need ot use some other character for separation like `:` in the mock configuration.~~\r\n- [x] Having `Name` be parsed by the internal parts *before* we actually make the secret source\r\n- [x] Having a way to define a Default secret source when named ones are also possible.\r\n- [ ] Some Benchmarks will be nice\r\n- [X] Docs of any kind  \r\n- [x] Moving to `k6/secrets` seems like a better idea - both easier to track if it used, but also will stop adding stuff to `\"k6\"` a module that mostly has stuff that ... are not great.\r\n- [ ] usage statistics on used secret source\r\n- [ ] Use Description and log which secret sources are used a kin to outputs\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\n<!-- A short (or detailed) explanation of why these changes
