pull request totally rewrites the old local executor and a bunch of other things. It builds on https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/913 and introduces quite a lot of new functionality, but it also has some minor breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### New features and changes\r\n\r\n#### New executors\r\n\r\nThe biggest change in this PR is the introduction of 7 distinct new VU executors:\r\n- [x] `shared-iterations`, a.k.a. `iterations` + `vus`.\r\n- [x] `constant-vus`, a.k.a. `duration` + `vus`.\r\n- [x] `ramping-vus`, a.k.a. `stages` + `vus`.\r\n- [x] `externally-controlled` is similar to `ramping-vus`, but the number of initialized and active VUs at any given time can be controlled by the k6 REST API - it's the only executor that could be paused or controlled while it's running (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/867, closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1028).\r\n- [x] `per-vu-iterations` is а new feature that allows each configured VU to execute an exact number of iterations; the shared iterations have caused confusion before and there are legitimate reasons people want an equal number of iterations for each VU (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/381, https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/663, https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/627, https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/378, and probably others).\r\n- [x] `constant-arrival-rate` executes a constant number of iterations per second (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/550).\r\n- [x] `ramping-arrival-rate` executes a variable number of iterations per second, specified as ramp-ups or ramp-downs `stages`, similar to how the `ramping-vus` is configured.\r\n\r\nThese executors can be configured via the new `execution` JS/JSON option. For now, they aren't directly configurable via CLI flags or environment variables.\r\n\r\nHowever, most of the old simple k6 uses where `stages`, or `iterations` or `duration` are specified in any way, including via CLI flags and env vars, are still supported. They are just transparently converted to their respective new `execution` executor configurations. There are some breaking changes here, described in detail in the *Breaking Changes* section below, but generally only when there is a conflict or ambiguity in the specified configuration.\r\n\r\n#### Other new features\r\n\r\n- [x] Multiple different executors can be configured in a single test run, both sequentially and in parallel (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/239).\r\n- [x] Each executor has a `startTime` property, which defines at what time relative to the test run start it will start executing.\r\n- [x] VUs are reused between the different configured executors when that's possible.\r\n- [x] Executors have new `gracefulStop` property that allows for iterations to complete gracefully for some amount of time after the normal executor duration is over (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/879); even with `gracefulStop=0`, i.e. the old behavior, metrics are emitted and processed in a much saner way (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1033)\r\n- [x] Validation of the supplied execution configuration is very strict (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/875 and slightly helps with https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/883)\r\n- [x] There is a new feature called execution segments that allows tests to be easily partitioned between multiple k6 instances (implements the execution parts of https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/997 and helps towards https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/140 and https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/864)\r\n- [x] There are separate descriptions and real-time thread-safe progress bars for each individual executor.\r\n- [x] Different executors can execute different functions than the `default` exported one.\r\n- [x] Different executors can have different environment variables.\r\n\r\n### Example of the new config\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport let options = {\r\n  scenarios: {\r\n    stages_up_down: {\r\n      executor: \"ramping-vus\",\r\n      startVUs: 0,\r\n      stages: [\r\n        { duration: \"10s\", target: 20 },\r\n        { duration: \"10s\", target: 0 },\r\n      ],\r\n      gracefulRampDown: \"0s\",\r\n      gracefulStop: \"0s\",\r\n    },\r\n    stages_down_up: {\r\n      executor: \"ramping-vus\",\r\n      startVUs: 20,\r\n      stages: [\r\n        { duration: \"10s\", target: 0 },\r\n        { duration: \"10s\", target: 20 },\r\n      ],\r\n      gracefulRampDown: \"0s\",\r\n      gracefulStop: \"0s\",\r\n    },\r\n    const_loop_vus: {\r\n      executor: \"constant-vus\",\r\n      vus: 20,\r\n      duration: \"20s\",\r\n      gracefulStop: \"0s\",\r\n    },\r\n    constant_arr_rate: {\r\n      executor: \"constant-arrival-rate\",\r\n      rate: 20,\r\n      timeUnit: \"1s\",\r\n      duration: \"10s\",\r\n      preAllocatedVUs: 10,\r\n      maxVUs: 20,\r\n      startTime: \"20s\",\r\n      gracefulStop: \"0s\",\r\n    },\r\n    variable_arr_rate: {\r\n      executor: \"ramping-arrival-rate\",\r\n      startRate: 20,\r\n      timeUnit: \"1s\",\r\n      preAllocatedVUs: 10,\r\n      maxVUs: 20,\r\n      startTime: \"20s\",\r\n      stages: [\r\n        { target: 0, duration: \"5s\" },\r\n        { target: 20, duration: \"5s\" },\r\n      ],\r\n      gracefulStop: \"0s\",\r\n    },\r\n    per_vu_iters: {\r\n      executor: \"per-vu-iterations\",\r\n      vus: 20,\r\n      iterations: 10,\r\n      startTime: \"30s\",\r\n      maxDuration: \"10s\",\r\n      gracefulStop: \"10s\",\r\n    },\r\n    shared_iters: {\r\n      executor: \"shared-iterations\",\r\n      vus: 20,\r\n      iterations: 200,\r\n      startTime: \"30s\",\r\n      maxDuration: \"10s\",\r\n      gracefulStop: \"10s\",\r\n    },\r\n    adjustable_at_will: {\r\n      executor: \"externally-controlled\",\r\n      vus: 5,\r\n      maxVUs: 10,\r\n      duration: \"40s\",\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default function () {\r\n  console.log(`Start VU ${__VU} ITER ${__ITER}`);\r\n  sleep(0.5 + Math.random() * 0.5);\r\n  console.log(`Done VU ${__VU} ITER ${__ITER}`);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n\r\nThere are a few breaking changes caused by this PR:\r\n- Execution config options (`execution`, `stages`, `iterations`, `duration`) from \"upper\" config layers overwrite execution options from \"lower\" (i.e. CLI flags > environment variables > JS options > JSON options) config layers. For example, the `--iterations` CLI flag will overwrite any execution options set as environment variables (e.g. `K6_DURATION`, `K6_STAGES`, etc.) or script options (`stages: [ /* ... */]`, `execution: { /* ... */ }`, etc. ).\r\n- Using different execution config options on the same level is now a configuration conflict error and will abort the script. For example, executing `k6 run --duration 10s --stages 5s:20 script.js` won't work (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/812). The only exception is combining `duration` and `iterations`, which will result in a `shared-iterations` executor with the specified non-default `maxDuration` (https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1058).\r\n- The k6 REST API for controlling script execution (i.e. the `k6 pause`, `k6 scale` commands) now only works when a `externally-controlled` executor is configured in the `execution` config. The initial pausing of a test (i.e. `k6 run --paused script.js`) still works with all executor types, but once the test is started with `k6 resume` (or the corresponding REST API call), it can't be paused again unless only the `externally-controlled` executor is used.\r\n- Previously, running a script with `k6 run --paused script.js` would have still executed the script's `setup()` function (if it was present and wasn't explicitly disabled with `--no-setup`) and paused immediately after. Now, k6 will pause before it executes `setup()`.\r\n- The `vusMax` / `K6_VUS_MAX` / ` -m` / `--max` option is deprecated - it was previously used for the control of the initialized VUs by the REST API. Since that has now been restricted to the `externally-controlled` executor, the equivalent option there is called `maxVUs`.\r\n- Tests with infinite duration are now only possible via the `externally-controlled` executor.\r\n- Previously, all iterations were interruptible - as soon as the specified `duration` expired, or when VUs were ramped down in a stage, any running iterations were interrupted. Now all executors besides the `externally-controlled` one have a `gracefulStop` period of `30s` by default (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/898). Additionally, `ramping-vus` executor has a `gracefulRampDown` parameter that configures the ramp-down grace period. For those periods, no new iterations will be started by the executors, but any currently running iterations will be allowed up to the specified periods to finish their execution.\r\n\r\n### Broken

refactor core (needs further discussion, previous discussion was in https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1007#discussion_r332447323)\r\n- [ ] update the [k6 architecture wiki page](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/wiki/Architecture)\r\n\r\n### `TODO`s in the code that will be handled in future pull requests, i.e. for now only issues will be created:\r\n- [x] handle Ctrl+C graceful shutdown + teardown execution\r\n- [x] have a special error code for Ctrl+C interrupts\r\n- [x] ~tag metrics from different executors differently~ (already described in

manually writing it as a JSON\r\n- [ ] changes and additions to the metrics and tags k6 emits, given the new executors - this includes tagging metrics with the executor ID by default, maybe split the vus metric by executor, a new metric for insufficient VUs by the arrival-rate executors\r\n\r\nThings that need to be done shortly before or after this PR is merged in `master`:\r\n- [ ] a lot of manual testing, especially on different OSes\r\n- [ ] update the documentation

I've noticed that json output takes up a lot of disk space for long running tests. I've found this issue #321, the csv output option was discussed there and I've decided to implement it. It works similar to json output, writing one sample per row. It uses twice as less space than json, so I've decided to open a pull request for it.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone can suggest a way, how to transform the samples, so it would be one line per http request. Then I will make the changes and reopen the pull request.\r\n\r\nI'm new to Go language, so I'm open to criticism.
