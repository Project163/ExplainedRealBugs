Brief summary\n\nk6 appears to be re-using a cached import for a relative path `../fragments/index.js` wherever you use it in the code that's being used in a testrun. \n\n### k6 version\n\n0.42\n\n### OS\n\nmacOS11 / Ubuntu Linux\n\n### Docker version and image (if applicable)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps to reproduce the problem\n\nUsing the relative path from the brief summary, if imported first in `src/graphql/a/operations/index.js` (to indicate `src/graphql/a/fragments/index.js`) and then later in `src/graphql/b/operations/index.js` (to indicate `src/graphql/b/fragments/index.js`) it will provide me with the former import (`src/graphql/a/fragments/index.js`).\r\n\r\nWe recently updated to v0.42.0 from v0.40 (where this issue did not occur) and after some digging into any recent changes, it appears to me (though bear in mind I have next to no knowledge in Go) that is what introduced the issue: https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/b750e206859a495b8a1fe12aa016dc8ed0e1c9db/js/initcontext.go#L109\r\n\r\nAt this point it seems to me that `../fragments/index.js` is what will serve as key in the cache, instead of the full URL (or anything that includes the file that is doing the importing).\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nFor the relative import to provide me with the correct file relative to whatever file it is being imported from.\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nA cached import for the exact same relative path name is being returned regardless of where it is being imported from.","closed_by":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2902/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
