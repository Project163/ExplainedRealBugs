following script: \r\n```javascript\r\nimport { Counter } from \"k6/metrics\";\r\nimport { group } from \"k6\";\r\nconst delay = () => { return Promise.resolve(); } // this is just a placeholder for something useful.\r\nlet l = new Counter(\"my coutner\")\r\n\r\nexport default () => {\r\n    group(\"coolgroup\", () => {\r\n        l.add(1) // nice\r\n\r\n        delay(1).then(() => {\r\n                l.add(1)// not so nice\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill *not* emit \"my counter\" with \"group=coolgroup\". \r\n\r\nTo that the user will need to wrap the inner parts of the `then` in a group as in \r\n```javascript\r\nimport { Counter } from \"k6/metrics\";\r\nimport { group } from \"k6\";\r\nconst delay = () => { return Promise.resolve(); }\r\nlet l = new Counter(\"my coutner\")\r\n\r\nexport default () => {\r\n    group(\"coolgroup\", () => {\r\n        l.add(1) // nice\r\n\r\n        delay(1).then(() => {\r\n            group(\"coolgroup\", () => {\r\n                l.add(1)// not so nice\r\n            });\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because `group` is kind of \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport exec from \"k6/execution\"\r\nfunction group (name, fn) {\r\n  let oldGroup = exec.vu.tags[\"group\"];\r\n  exec.vu.tags[\"group\"] = oldGroup + \":\" + name;\r\n  try {\r\n    fn() // the actual inner function\r\n  } finally {\r\n    exec.vu.tags[\"group\"] = oldGroup;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the `then` \"callbacks\" get called only after the stack is empty the whole `group` code would have been executed, resetting the group back to the root name (which is empty). And when the `then` get's called it will have an empty group. \r\n\r\nThe \"workaround\" works as it just calls `group` again. \r\n\r\nA more hacking but ... more useful workaround is \r\n```javascript\r\nimport { Counter } from \"k6/metrics\";\r\nimport { group } from \"k6\";\r\nconst delay = () => { return Promise.resolve(); }\r\nlet l = new Counter(\"my coutner\")\r\n\r\nlet originalThen = Promise.prototype.then;\r\nPromise.prototype.then = function(onResolved, onRejected) {\r\n    let o = onResolved\r\n    onResolved = function(res) {\r\n        group(\"coolgroup\", () => { // this in practice will need to get hte group name\r\n            o(res);\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n    // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55413715/cant-i-overwrite-the-then-function-of-promise\r\n    return originalThen.call(originalThen.call(this, onResolved, onRejected), undefined, error => {\r\n        console.log(`upload the error to server: ${error}`);\r\n        throw error;\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default () => {\r\n    group(\"coolgroup\", () => {\r\n        l.add(1) // nice\r\n\r\n        delay(1).then(() => {\r\n            l.add(1)// not so nice\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ... likely has *other* problems. \r\n\r\n### Solutions: \r\n\r\nI would argue this might be just showing that `group` is a *bad* abstraction and should be deprecated. It makes little sense in a lot of the cases. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand people are using it (albeit sometimes wrongly) and likely will still want to use it once k6 has a lot more async APIs (which return promises). \r\n\r\nSome of those can be fixed in the actual go code - it can get the `group` before returning the promise. Which in practice is needed as getting the group in a goroutine while js code is runnign si racy as `group()` call can be made, changing it, while the goroutine gets it.\r\n\r\nThis in no way helps though  with later `.then` calls. \r\n\r\nSo for a more real example \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndelay(1).then(() => {\r\n  return anotherPromise();\r\n}).then((resultFromAnotherPromise)=>{\r\n  return morepromises();\r\n}.then((.....\r\n```\r\nfor all of those setting `group` will currently not work great. \r\n\r\n### `async`/`await` support:\r\n\r\nWhile we *might* be able to fix some of this for case wher `group(\"name\" , async function () {...})` through just doing some magic in `group` - that will likely only work for the `await` usages, but not if you then ( :wink: ) call `.then` or something. \r\n\r\n So it might work great for some of the \"async\" stuff but not for the other. \r\n\r\n### pure callbacks\r\n\r\nIf somebody has an API that just have callbacks ... having them support `group` will be on a case by case callback basis. They will need to make certain to get the `group` from where the `callback` is defined and then when making it to set the `group` ... and then unset it.\r\n\r\n### API changes \r\n\r\nI guess it is possible for the `js/eventloop` to provide API to ...that, but that will likely be quite involved, but might be the easiest way forward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2728/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2728/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8364966078,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAz4Wr85ZqkYnzwAAAAHyl0C-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/8364966078","actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"22f852485f082aae2d73201752ef9213ac97d9a3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/commits/22f852485f082aae2d73201752ef9213ac97d9a3","created_at":"2023-01-26T15:08:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8364979746,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAz4Wr85ZqkYnzwAAAAHyl3Yi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/8364979746","actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0f22696cb95f2d7687fde3c84a46ba2b174510a4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/commits/0f22696cb95f2d7687fde3c84a46ba2b174510a4","created_at":"2023-01-26T15:09:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-26T15:10:04Z","updated_at":"2023-01-26T15:10:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2877","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2877/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2877/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2877/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2877","id":1558295117,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAz4Wr85ImWRs","number":2877,"title":"http:

General description\r\n\r\nK6 has historically had only synchronous calls as it also did not have an event loop in order for asynchronous calls to be implemented.\r\n\r\nThis is no longer the case:\r\n1. There is now an event loop\r\n2. A bunch of APIs are now asynchronous or have asynchronous counterparts.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately mixing synchronous calls with asynchronous ones leads to blocking the event loop effectively slowing down the execution of asynchronous ones. \r\n\r\nOld users will likely have particular problems as they might want to start using a single asynchronous API call. But it will seem to work badly if there are also a bunch of synchronous calls blocking the event loop, delaying the return of a result and potentially making the test fail due to it.\r\n\r\nA good example of this happening was [already reported](https://github.com/grafana/k6-docs/issues/1070), with `sleep`. \r\n\r\n### Solution \r\n\r\nDuring discussions about  (in early December) #2728 and the  #2863 it was discussed if we can warn users when they call synchronous calls in async functions. This obviously depends on us being able to detect that we are currently in async function at all.\r\n\r\nAt the time it wasn't certain if that will be possible and later, as #2863 was not merged, work on this stalled, and I never even started working on possible solution. \r\n\r\nCurrently, it seems like goja does provide us a way to know we are in an [asynchronous context](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dop251/goja#AsyncContextTracker). But even without it in practice the moment the first call in the event loop is over - any consequent call is within an asynchronous context, by definition as it need to originate from an asynchronous operation. \r\n\r\n### Problems:\r\n\r\n#### Scope:\r\n\r\nI would argue there should be a way to detect whether we are in async context by a JS module, and then it can decide whether to log a warning.\r\n\r\nThis likely will be done for all relevant core k6 blocking calls, but extensions writers can choose what to do.\r\n\r\n#### Warning \"fatigue\"\r\n\r\nIt will be nice if users don't see 1 warning per each execution but just per each original call. As it will also not be nice if they don't see all occurrences of this. Especially while transitioning, and they have 10 synchronous calls and 1 asynchronous one.\r\n\r\nThis can likely be done with some helper function \r\n```golang\r\ncommon.WarnOnce(logger, msg, idKey) \r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Time will likely fix this\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before this is a problem mostly due to k6 having only synchronous calls for years. Over time users will stop use them as the new asynchronous ones become more popular and versatile. We also are likely to deprecated all the old ones and have warnings in the documentation against usage.\r\n\r\nThis still let users mistakenly using synchronous APIs. Also, there will likely be more than a year before most people use asynchronous APIs instead of synchronous ones even if we do more of #2825 type of changes instead of whole API redesigns, which take way longer.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2967/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18064520544,"node_id":"SE_lADOAz4Wr85ZqkYnzwAAAAQ0urVg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/18064520544","actor":{"login":"Stonepaw","id":19153066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTUzMDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19153066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw","html_url":"https://github.com/Stonepaw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-09T23:45:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18064520972,"node_id":"UE_lADOAz4Wr85ZqkYnzwAAAAQ0urcM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/18064520972","actor":{"login":"Stonepaw","id":19153066,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTUzMDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19153066?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw","html_url":"https://github.com/Stonepaw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Stonepaw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unsubscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-09T23:45:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
