These flows usually go like this:\r\n\r\n1. Start by doing a request: `response = http.get(someUrl)`\r\n2. Do `response = response.submitForm()` a couple of times. Sometimes provide some custom data.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about this is that the test follows the real flow: each step is based on the result of the previous step.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes in these flows a user would click a link instead of submit a form (the idea is the same, but the technical implementation slightly different.\r\nThis breaks with that principle. In the test you suddenly get an `http.get` call again. Not using anything from the response.\r\n\r\nA solution for this would be to add a `response.clickLink()` method:\r\n- `selector` the selector for the link which will be 'clicked'. Optional, default: 'a'.\r\n- `params` custom request paramaters. Optional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"robingustafsson","id":1792533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTI1MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1792533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson","html_url":"https://github.com/robingustafsson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
