I launch the [test server from this `h2c` example](https://github.com/veqryn/h2c) and run the following k6 script with k6 v0.24.0 (basically, emulating what `curl -v --http2 http://localhost:8080/` does, even though we [don't currently support h2c connections](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/970)):\r\n```js\r\nimport http from \"k6/http\";\r\n\r\nexport default function () {\r\n   http.get(\"http://localhost:8080/\", {\r\n       headers: {\r\n           \"Connection\": \"Upgrade, HTTP2-Settings\",\r\n           \"Upgrade\": \"h2c\",\r\n           \"HTTP2-Settings\": \"AAMAAABkAARAAAAAAAIAAAAA\",\r\n       }\r\n   });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nk6 will get completely stuck... And by that I mean that neither `Ctrl+C` will stop it, nor will k6 exit by itself when the script `duration` is exceeded. It will have to be killed externally... :face_with_head_bandage: This currently only occurs with k6 v0.24.0, but the actual root cause of the issue lies with a change introduced in Go 1.12, which we used to compile k6 v0.24.0. So other older k6 releases compiled by it, like some `master` Docker images (since we build them with `golang:1-alpine`) or user builds could also be affected.\r\n\r\nThere are at least two things, revealed by this bug, that we need to fix. The first part is that something in the event handling inside of k6 is broken, since it shouldn't be possible to get stuck like this from a single misbehaving HTTP request, whatever else may be.\r\n\r\nThe second part is that we need to properly handle these `Upgrade` requests in k6. @MStoykov  found the root cause of the bug (by bisecting the Go source! :1st_place_medal: ) in this Go commit: https://github.com/golang/go/commit/541620409dee210c5498cc38433dcf690f58f888. We definitely don't want to have infinite requests, at the very least, the configured `timeout` values should be respected. And we also should investigate other `Upgrade` uses like websockets. I think this should also be unit-testable as well, so we don't relapse in the future...","closed_by":{"login":"imiric","id":1009277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDkyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1009277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric","html_url":"https://github.com/imiric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/971/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/971/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
