why a user was running out of memory running a simple script after some time, I discovered that apparently influxdb leaks memory ... :(. Using the simple script below (optimized for metrics ;) )\r\n```javascript\r\nimport http from \"k6/http\";\r\nimport {sleep} from \"k6\";\r\n\r\nexport let options = {\r\n    duration: \"10m\",\r\n    thresholds: {\r\n        \"responseTime\": [\"p(95)<2000\", \"p(70)<1500\", \"avg<1500\", \"med<1200\", \"min<500\"],\r\n    },\r\n    discardResponseBodies: true,\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default function () {\r\n    http.batch (\r\n        [[\"GET\", `${__ENV.HOST}`],\r\n        [\"GET\", `${__ENV.HOST}`],\r\n        [\"GET\", `${__ENV.HOST}`],\r\n        [\"GET\", `${__ENV.HOST}`],\r\n        [\"GET\", `${__ENV.HOST}`],\r\n        [\"GET\", `${__ENV.HOST}`],\r\n        [\"GET\", `${__ENV.HOST}`],\r\n        [\"GET\", `${__ENV.HOST}`],\r\n        [\"GET\", `${__ENV.HOST}`],\r\n        [\"GET\", `${__ENV.HOST}`],\r\n]);\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnd hitting local simple golang http server serving empty files you can run out of memory 16GB of memory in 7 minutes with 200 VUS while without influxdb you can run 2k VUS with somewhere around 7-8GB including calculating thresholds. \r\nBelow is the difference between the inuse objects from the 3th to the 4th minute:\r\n```\r\npprof) top10\r\nShowing nodes accounting for 7987343, 63.13% of 12653129 total\r\nDropped 83 nodes (cum <= 63265)\r\nShowing top 10 nodes out of 96\r\n      flat  flat%   sum%        cum   cum%\r\n   1605656 12.69% 12.69%    5633669 44.52%  github.com/loadimpact/k6/vendor/github.com/influxdata/influxdb/client/v2.NewPoint\r\n   1277291 10.09% 22.78%    1419291 11.22%  github.com/loadimpact/k6/vendor/github.com/influxdata/influxdb/models.MakeKey\r\n   1271690 10.05% 32.83%    4072794 32.19%  github.com/loadimpact/k6/vendor/github.com/influxdata/influxdb/models.NewPoint\r\n    813813  6.43% 39.27%     813813  6.43%  strconv.fmtF\r\n    699521  5.53% 44.80%    1668937 13.19%  github.com/loadimpact/k6/lib/netext/httpext.(*transport).measureAndEmitMetrics\r\n    557072  4.40% 49.20%     557072  4.40%  github.com/loadimpact/k6/vendor/github.com/dop251/goja.asciiString.concat\r\n    502463  3.97% 53.17%    1316276 10.40%  github.com/loadimpact/k6/vendor/github.com/influxdata/influxdb/models.appendField\r\n    475148  3.76% 56.92%     475148  3.76%  strings.(*Builder).WriteString\r\n    418758  3.31% 60.23%     418758  3.31%  github.com/loadimpact/k6/stats/influxdb.(*Collector).extractTagsToValues\r\n    365931  2.89% 63.13%    6713318 53.06%  github.com/loadimpact/k6/stats/influxdb.(*Collector).batchFromSamples\r\n(pprof)\r\n```\r\nClearly some of those influxdb objects are the problem. I am under the impression that maybe the library shouldn't be used like that, but just in case (and because it will be way quicker) I would like to update the dependancy and test again. Unfortunately due to some influxdb refactoring (and probably the new version 2) It has changed repos ;( to https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb1-client . So maybe if we had been using [modules](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1070) that would've been easy again :( ","closed_by":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1081/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1081/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
