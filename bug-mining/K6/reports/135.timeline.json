I mentioned in https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1479#pullrequestreview-426625213, I don't like how complex the `vuHandle` implementation has gotten. True, its job is very tricky, so I am a bit skeptical about my gut feeling we can simplify it... It has to deal with a few gnarly synchronization issues:\r\n1. The `gracefulStop` / `gracefulRampDown` handling, which can require a VU that is in the process of gracefully shutting down to resume again, without ever returning the VU to the pool, if we suddenly ramp up. And we don't know how long the last iteration it's executing is going to be, so it can end at basically any time in that process, or not at all... :sob: \r\n2. The VU deactivation, which, because of the way we stop their goja JS runtime (by necessity), happens a bit after the VU context is cancelled...\r\n3. The unpredictable nature of the `externally-controlled` executor...\r\n\r\nI initially thought that this will finally be a job for [`sync.Cond`](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Cond), but because of the `context` we require for JS execution and deactivation, it really doesn't seem to be of much use, though I might be missing something :disappointed: That said, it might not be totally out of place in some bigger refactoring, for example if we use the `changed` atomic more broadly. That is, if instead of just signalling that something has changed, we use a few different values to signal the current state `Stopped` / `Running` / `GracefullyStopping` that the executor is supposed to be in... But that has issues of its own, namely something has to cancel the VU context...\r\n\r\nSomething else to consider... For `variable-looping-vus` executor, we can know the precise time each VU is supposed to run, including the `gracefulStop` value. It will become easier to calculate once we zip `rawStepEvents` and `gracefulLimitEvents` in a single plan, to address https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1473. So, instead of having a resident goroutine for each VU we want to run (i.e. a stopped `vuHandle`), we can launch new goroutines every time we ramp up, and give 2 unique contexts to each of them, somewhat similar to what we do with the executor contexts, ` maxDurationCtx, regDurationCtx, cancel := getDurationContexts()`... That would still leave the problem of what to do with the `externally-controlled` executor though... \r\n\r\nAnd it also won't solve the issues with rapid ramp-down, ramp-up events. In these, we may have a situation where a VU is in the process of gracefully stopping, but it's still executing its last iteration. And if, before the `gracefulRampDown` time expires, we ramp up to that VU again, the VU never has to stop. So, in this case, what we do on the iteration length - for short iteration, we would have returned the VU to the buffer, but for iterations longer than the gap, it should be as if there was never any interruption in the VU running at all. This is the trickiest issue that I can't think of any other way besides a \"`vuHandle`\" to solve... :disappointed: \r\n\r\nSo yeah, leaving this here for some future time, if we have any bright ideas... Or, we can close this a few months from now and just use my ramblings above as a documentation/justification of the current approach :sweat_smile:

fix VLV not respecting gracefulStop since 270fd91c, add test for it\r\nand try to make some other VLV tests more stable.\r\n\r\nThe original code (pre 270fd91c) did go through all the raw steps\r\n(ramp up/down) and the graceful stop ones concurrently and when the raw\r\nsteps ended it will return from Run, but will start a goroutine to go\r\nthrough the remainign graceful stop ones. The most important of which (\r\nat least in my current understanding) being the last one which is the\r\nactuall gracefulStop end which will make all VUs stop. The reason why\r\nthis actually worked is that it also waiting on all activeVUs to have\r\nended being active, being returned in the new terminology, before it\r\nactually cancels the context for all of them. So if the VUs manage to\r\nend iterations in this time the executor will end earlier if not the\r\ngracefuStop will make them.\r\n\r\n270fd91c broke the returning of VUs which lead to the executor never\r\nreturning and moving the cancel \"before\" the waiting for activeVUs fixed\r\nthat at the cost of gracefulStop not being taken into account, but with\r\nno tests, nobody noticed.\r\n\r\nHere I basically revert that especially because vuHandle now returns VUs\r\nwhen stopped.\r\n\r\nfixes
