fixes a regression introduced in 2753196ab where in all imports are cached on the specifier that is provided for them. This is fine for k6 modules which happen to always have the same absolute names.\r\n\r\nBut source modules can have relative paths that resolve to different absolute ones depending on where they are imported from.\r\n\r\nFor example: import { cool } from \"./somepath/cool.js\"` - was cached based on the name/key \"./somepath/cool.js\" and it will be returned if anywhere in the code that same import specifier is used. \r\n  \r\nBut this is a bug if this is done from two different directories. \r\n  \r\nAs in one called from `/A/A.js` and from `/B/B.js` should get two different files `/A/somepath/cool.js` and `/B/somepath/cool.js`. Instead, in v0.42.0 the first to load the relative path will be wrongly cached with the relative path, and then it will be used for the other import as well.\r\n\r\nNow k6 again caches source modules based on their *absolute* paths.   \r\n\r\nFixes #2902\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2903/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2903/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8448663264,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAz4Wr85dvc0UzwAAAAH3lF7g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/8448663264","actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-06T15:24:28Z","milestone":{"title":"v0.43.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/1419261924","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2902#issuecomment-1419261924","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2902","id":1419261924,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAz4Wr85UmDfk","user":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-06T15:24:31Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T15:24:31Z","body":"Thanks for reporting this :bow: \r\n\r\nUnfortunately you are right. That code was added to the module caching mostly for internal modules (implemented in go) as source modules (as the one you are talking about) have had separate cache for ... years. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately none of our tests caught this and apperantly it isn't as common to happen so  nobody else has reported for over a month of this public.\r\n\r\nI have created a [bug fix](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2903) and there is already a [PR refactoring](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2881) this in a way that it is already fixed there. \r\n\r\nThe fix will land in v0.43.0 which is slatted for release in 2 weeks.
