- I suggest we do what @uppfinnarn mentions above - we let tests \"recover\" and perhaps remove the --abort-on-taint option. Would be a cleaner solution. Tests will run until the end (or they are aborted), and the threshold status at the time the test ends is what determines if the whole test is a pass or a fail.\r\n\r\nThe reason I wanted to be able to abort tests early if some threshold failed was that I wanted to run many small load tests in a CI test suite, and then you want to save time if possible. If I can abort the test prematurely because my failure criteria has already been met, then that can be useful to shorten the time it takes to run a test suite with many small load tests in it.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I think this (being able to abort early) is \"luxury\" functionality that we really don't know if anyone but me want/need. As @aidylewis points out, looking at the thresholds once after the test is done is really the MVP here - maybe we should focus on that?\r\n\r\nOne issue also, with checking thresholds during the test, is that you have no control over what set of samples k6 will be using to check the threshold - i.e. I think there is a \"grace period\" right now, at the start of the test where thresholds aren't checked, right?  Can't remember exactly, but the point is:\r\n\r\n- if we check e.g. \"95th percentile RTT should be <100ms\" and do it after the very first HTTP request, then the test may fail just because that single request happened to be over 100ms (which is not unlikely, given that time-consuming things like DNS lookups tend to happen early in the test).\r\n\r\nIntroducing a magical grace period, that the user has no means of affecting, is not the best solution. Neither is clumping together samples in sets, maybe based on time intervals, and checking thresholds against samples in a set. We don't know if the intervals/set size is what the user wants. IMO, the only really \"clean\" solution, that doesn't mean introducing new complex functionality to let people control when/for what data thresholds are checked, is to only check them once after the test has ended - on all samples.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/277350271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ragnarlonn","id":6524809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjQ4MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6524809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn","html_url":"https://github.com/ragnarlonn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":948636464,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTQ4NjM2NDY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/948636464","actor":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-03T20:12:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":948636465,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDk0ODYzNjQ2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/948636465","actor":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-03T20:12:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":948636466,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTQ4NjM2NDY2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/948636466","actor":null,"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-03T20:12:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":948636468,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDk0ODYzNjQ2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/948636468","actor":null,"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-03T20:12:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":950539486,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk1MDUzOTQ4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/950539486","actor":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com
