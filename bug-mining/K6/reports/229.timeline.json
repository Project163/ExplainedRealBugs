However you will have to keep changing the transformation for that to happen. When you run tests under different conditions, shorter/less intensive tests are more likely to have µs units, where as longer/more intensive tests will more likely pass the 1 second threshold thus be in ms. It becomes problematic and less streamlined if you need to do different transformations to the same metric under different test conditions.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/346809839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"V3ckt0r","id":10748283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQ4Mjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10748283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/V3ckt0r","html_url":"https://github.com/V3ckt0r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V3ckt0r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V3ckt0r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V3ckt0r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V3ckt0r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V3ckt0r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V3ckt0r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V3ckt0r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V3ckt0r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/V3ckt0r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1357012281,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTM1NzAxMjI4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/1357012281","actor":null,"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-24T11:40:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1357012282,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEzNTcwMTIyODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/1357012282","actor":null,"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-24T11:40:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/346811074","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/363#issuecomment-346811074","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/363","id":346811074,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NjgxMTA3NA==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-24T11:47:04Z","updated_at":"2017-11-24T11:47:04Z","body":"This is going back some time but *I think* I remember InfluxDB automatically moving from milliseconds to seconds (for example) when visualising through Grafana.
