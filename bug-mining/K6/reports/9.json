Because above all *it makes using the app harder* \r\n\r\nThere are also other arguments against it:  \r\n\r\n- Are we aiming to make an app that is safe from local exploits?  That is a tall order. Right now, there are likely other, equally serious local exploits that we would have to start working on, if our aim is to provide a \"secure\" app. I question whether this feature alone makes much of a difference to a determined attacker. I think it is *much* better to avoid all security concerns inside our app and focus on the core functionality of generating traffic and measuring stuff.\r\n\r\n- There exists simple-to-use external functionality that provides the same level of security, or better (chroot).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/58/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/58/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
