Would that be useful, do you think?  And yes, a suite of small JS tests would be better from a testing perspective, but I personally feel that a single file exercising all script API functionality could serve as a really nice introduction & reference to the scripting API. Documentation needs would then motivate people (perhaps me primarily) to update it as new functionality becomes available, and the regression testing comes as a bonus.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/315291047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ragnarlonn","id":6524809,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjQ4MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6524809?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn","html_url":"https://github.com/ragnarlonn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragnarlonn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1163840881,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTE2Mzg0MDg4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/1163840881","actor":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-14T07:25:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1163840882,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDExNjM4NDA4ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/1163840882","actor":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-14T07:25:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/319197127","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/280#issuecomment-319197127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/280","id":319197127,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTE5NzEyNw==","user":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-31T21:08:41Z","updated_at":"2017-07-31T21:08:41Z","body":"I
