of the below might be relevant to other executors not mentioned \r\n\r\n# Less goroutines starts\r\nAs suggested in this [comment](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1285#discussion_r402952759) it might be better if instead of constantly starting goroutines for each iteration, instead to have each VU in a \"permanent\" goroutine and send it iteration to start. \r\nThis will probably be more performant but has the downside that unlike the current approach doesn't guarantee that the least used VU will do the next iteration ... which might be something we care about a lot. \r\n\r\nI propose we try it out and benchmark it .. if it is really a lot faster and has some amount of balancing - I am for using it. \r\n\r\n\r\n# Bucketing iterations\r\nWhile discussing how accurate the proposed start of iterations we came to the idea that having a way to be ... \"less\" accurate is a good idea. A lot of times people have asked if they can start a number of iterations at the same time and it is also the way that probably some people will understand the arrival rate executors: you start 10 iterations at the beginning of each second. instead of you start 10 iterations over 1 second. The proposal is that we add yet another argument which is in what buckets we should start iterations (I guess we can also use it for variable looping VUs to start VUs in buckets :) ). \r\n\r\nSo :\r\n```\r\nexecution:{\r\n       \"var1\": {\r\n            type: \"variable-arrival-rate\",\r\n            startRate: 50,\r\n            timeUnit: \"1s\",\r\n            timeBucket: \"100ms\",\r\n            preAllocatedVUs: 20,\r\n            stages: [\r\n                { target: 50, duration: \"5s\"},\r\n                { target: 100, duration: \"5s\", timeBucket \"500ms\"},\r\n                { target: 100, duration: \"5s\" },\r\n            ],\r\n        },\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWould mean that for the first 5 seconds instead of starting one iteration each 1s/50 = 20ms. We will start 5 iterations each 100ms (the time bucket).\r\nThen instead of ramping up (linearly from 50 to 100), which usually would've meant that will be starting iterations every 20ms-10ms depending on how close to the end of the ramp-up we are we will start all the iterations for each 500ms at the same time every 500ms. \r\nFinally instead of doing 1 iteration every 10ms(1s/100) we will start10 iterations every 100ms (the `timeBucket`).\r\n\r\nI wonder if this will not be easier with defining a number of iterations instead of time ... maybe both could be supported.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should add another executor for this instead, as this will probably worsen the usual performance? Although it is important to note that the original proposal was to do this by default for 1ms  so we don't need to sleep so much .. and possibly be nearly as accurate ... so all of those need to be tested :D
