a few bugs when manually testing the `variable-looping-vus` (i.e. `stages`) executor.

This then repeats a few times until the duration is done :confused: \r\n\r\nThe second bug I found happened when I enabled the commented-out execution segment option. Notice the `Graceful stop` event at t=43s (in the cast, ~2s into the second script execution), when we should be ramping up VUs, not stopping them :confused: This then repeats a few times, notice how the value of X in the text `currently X active looping VUs` wobbles, when it should consistently and gradually increment from 0 to 5 in the first 10 seconds and then gracefully decrement...","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3260385325,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDMyNjAzODUzMjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/3260385325","actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-22T12:37:34Z","milestone":{"title":"v0.27.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/617971878","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/1308#issuecomment-617971878","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1308","id":617971878,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNzk3MTg3OA==","user":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-22T19:05:13Z","updated_at":"2020-04-22T19:05:50Z","body":"This is not fixed yet, `shared-iterations` doesn't partition iterations and `constant-arrival-rate` even has a new bug.

Feature Description\n\nIn the current state of things, when `stages` are defined in a load test configuration (`options`); the interpolation observed during both ramping up and ramping down is always linear.\r\n\r\n![K6 Linear Ramping up and down](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/690867/142835075-6836215f-ac2f-4cdc-8f13-ed64dbc954a7.png)\r\n \r\n We think, and heard from our users, that it could also be useful to support custom **non-linear** interpolation functions to drive the transition between stages. Their usage could be driven by a dedicated `interpolation` in the `stages` objects.\r\n \r\n![K6 Ramping up and down](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/690867/142835500-7a2d0bc8-6432-4912-949c-1cb783c8e9bb.png)\r\n\r\nAs a starting set of custom interpolation function, we propose:\r\n- `linear`: the **default**, and already implemented interpolation function transitions between stages following using a linear function.\r\n- `exponential`: drives the interpolation/transition between two stages following an exponential function.\r\n- `instant`: drives the interpolation/transition following a square-wave like function; effectively making transitions between stages seemingly instantaneous.\r\n- `easeIn`: drives the interpolation/transition between two stages using a function that produces a slow progression at the beginning, and a fast/abrupt one at the end.
