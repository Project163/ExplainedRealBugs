in the error handling code before...\r\n- The message `setup: Timeout during setup` could be rephrased as `Timeout during setup() execution`\r\n- Even better, `setup() execution timed out after X seconds`\r\n\r\nHere's a proposal how the above scenario could look like:\r\n```\r\nERRO[0010] setup() execution timed out after 10 seconds         hint=\"You can increase the time limit via the

is currently very uninformative, even if there are\r\nduplicated error messages.\r\n\r\nThis PR change TimeoutError to a struct, which contains both the place\r\nand the timeout duration, so it helps constructing error message with\r\nmore useful information to user.\r\n\r\nWhile at it, also prevent duplicating timeout error message for setup\r\nand teardown.\r\n\r\nClose
