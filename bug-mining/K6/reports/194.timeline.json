see it as a fairly simple solution to attract JMeter users. It would not handle the most complex configurations. The big advantage over a proxy-based solution is in the onboarding. @micsjo may be right that many JMeter users are familiar with proxy-based recording, but let's consider the onboarding flow here: if a JMeter user has a need to do some load testing, and wants to reuse some old JMeter test plans but is interested in using a new tool (k6), the Fiddler-based solution assumes that:\r\n\r\n- The Jmeter environment is up and running, fully functional\r\n- The test/sink environment is up and running, will accept traffic and that we're allowed to test it *right now*\r\n- The user has a Windows machine up and running\r\n- The user has Fiddler installed\r\n- The user has Fiddler2k6 installed\r\n\r\nOn comparison, a Jmeter2k6 converter hosted online assumes *zero* of these things. The user just has to have a web browser. This fact is going to dramatically increase the funnel for the hosted-converter-tool solution, and make it a lot more efficient as a way to increase k6 adoption among JMeter

testing web pages, it's common to use some `recorders` to help auto-generating load scripts.\r\n\r\nThis is a useful feature for web pages testing because, amongst other things, page assets change often its filename on each deployment (when adding fingerprint checksums to the filename before uploading to the CDN). \r\n\r\nDeployment 1: https://subdomain.cloudfront.net/images/foo-342b0f87ea609e6d349c7925d86bd597.png\r\n\r\nDeployment 2: https://subdomain.cloudfront.net/images/foo-735d6c098496507e26bb40ecc8c1394d.png\r\n\r\n\r\nA recorder can help to:\r\n\r\n- create your first version of your load tests\r\n- identify some of your web page assets\r\n\r\n\r\nOther load testing tools offer similar utils either as command option as [\"gatling\"](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/tree/master/gatling-recorder/src/test/resources/har) or making use of external libraries as [\"jmeter\"](https://github.com/Seitenbau/har2JMeter). \r\n\r\nIn case the converter made sense, I see two possibilities:\r\n\r\n1) Add the conversion option to `k6`\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nk6 convert  my-session.har -o script.js\r\n```\r\n2) Create an external tool for example as global npm package\r\n \r\n```\r\nnpm install -g hartok6\r\nhartok6 convert  my-session.har -o script.js\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have the doubts with the first option because I am not a fan to expand the scope of libraries and tools, but if the `HAR` approach proves to be a robust solution to the problem, I find better the `k6 convert` option because of developer convenience.
