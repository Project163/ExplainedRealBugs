seen in https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1036#issue-450791743, core.js is responsible for the vast majority of VU memory usage and initialization time for simple scripts, even after the fixes from https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1038. \r\n\r\nAlso, currently babel transformation happens on the \"do it if it fails without it\": https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/2a2fe2cc665e0d2b818c4f3ca7ce4fc9a5821294/js/compiler/compiler.go#L131-L146\r\n\r\nI think this is wrong for a few different reasons:\r\n- it's unpredictable and confusing - some files of a project may be transpiled, others may not be\r\n- it's probably slower - likely, the vast majority of files will fail the direct goja parsing, so they will need to be transpiled, so the initial parsing is a waste of effort\r\n- there are probably corner cases where goja could parse a file at the surface level and not return an error, but when it later tries executing it, it would fail\r\n\r\nSo the proposal is that by default k6 would always transpile files with babel and include core.js, but we'll have a flag to completely disable that behavior for users that don't need these things or for power users that have their own script bundling/transformation pipeline.","closed_by":{"login":"imiric","id":1009277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDkyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1009277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric","html_url":"https://github.com/imiric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1049/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1049/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
