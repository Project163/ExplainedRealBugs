Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\r\nI am trying to create a github action which uses k6 to test on a localhost server, but the server refuses to connect.\r\n## Environment\r\n<!--- Provide as much information about your environment as possible: output from `k6 version`,\r\n      OCI runtime and image information if using containers, cloud execution environment, etc. -->\r\n- k6 version: 0.26.2\r\n- OS and version: Mac OS 10.14.6\r\n- Docker version and image, if applicable:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what should happen -->\r\nCreate a github action which performs load testing on each push on a local instance (port 3000).\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n<!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior

#1059 it has been allowed to import URLs with a scheme or more specifically with `https`(`file` is also supported for local files). \r\n\r\nPrevious to this, it was specifically required that there is no scheme and an `https://` was added to the front and tried.
