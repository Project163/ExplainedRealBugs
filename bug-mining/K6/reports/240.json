Brief summary\r\n\r\nTracing instrumentation wrongly overwrites HTTP methods in the client and assigns `PATCH` method to both `POST` and `PUT` requests.\r\n\r\n### k6 version\r\n\r\n0.43\r\n\r\n### OS\r\n\r\nall\r\n\r\n### Docker version and image (if applicable)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the problem\r\n\r\n1. Instrument code with `tracing.instrumentHTTP`\r\n2. Call `http.post` or `http.put`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nInstrumented tracing HTTP client sends:\r\n* a `POST` request when `http.post` is invoked\r\n* a `PUT` request when `http.put` is invoked\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nMethods `http.post` and `http.put` methods after calling `tracing.instrumentHTTP` send HTTP `PATCH` request.\r\nI'm not familiar with k6 code base but these [two lines](https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/12f5dd846338d251b5d7702111b3a3533d3e0dc6/js/modules/k6/experimental/tracing/module.go#L155-L156) seem to be a reason for this behavior.\r\n\r\nIf you agree that these two lines are causing this issue, I'll be happy to provide a fix.","closed_by":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2983/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
