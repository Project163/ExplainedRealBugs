huge thanks for reporting and fixing this! Unfortunately, as you say in your [jslib PR](https://github.com/grafana/jslib.k6.io/pull/40), contributing changes like this to jslib.k6.io is not ideal at the moment because of the versioned files... :disappointed: I am working on moving the summary code to its own repo and using jslib only for distributions. Unfortunately, that might take a while, since we also want to make the license less restrictive (Apache2 instead of AGPL3, so that people can use the code more freely in their own private projects), but also set up a CLA (because we also bundle the same code in k6)...\r\n\r\nSo, unfortunately, we can't merge your PR in jslib just yet... :disappointed: To qualify you for hacktoberfest and to release the fix in k6 v0.35.0, can you please make your PR against the [copy of the summary JS code that's bundled in k6](https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/master/js/summary.js) instead? Since we already have a CLA set up here, it will be fine and we can merge it. This way we'll also be able to release it as v0.0.2 in jslib and the new upcoming repo without any legal issues, I think...\r\n\r\nThis year we're sending our own merch for hacktoberfest as well, so if you contact @FloorD at `floor[at]grafana.com`, she will send you
