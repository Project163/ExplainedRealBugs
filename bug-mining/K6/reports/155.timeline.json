Two things to consider here, where to specify it; CLI vs script options (is this something you'd want to version control with the script?), and what format to use to identify the NICs; IP/CIDR vs interface name.\r\n\r\nI guess we at least have the following possibilities in terms of CLI (allowing CLI option to be specified more than once):\r\n- CLI and IP: `k6 run --nic 1.2.3.4`\r\n- CLI and CIDR (matching any NIC with an IP in the block): `k6 run --nic 1.2.3.0/24`\r\n- CLI and interface name: `k6 run --nic eth0` (or `k6 run --nic eth+` to match all `eth` interfaces etc.)\r\n\r\nand for script option something along the lines of this:\r\n```js\r\nexport let options = {\r\n    nics: [\"eth0\", \"eth+\", \"!eth\", \"1.2.3.4\", \"1.2.3.4/32\", \"2a00:1450:400f:806::200e\"]\r\n};\r\n```\r\nI'd propose we start with a CLI option (like `--nic`) supporting both IP addresses, CIDRs and interface names as input.\r\n\r\nNow, in terms of implementation would a simple round-robin selection of interface to use for a VU to make TCP connections be enough?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/359075821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"robingustafsson","id":1792533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTI1MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1792533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson","html_url":"https://github.com/robingustafsson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1433155045,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQzMzE1NTA0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/1433155045","actor":{"login":"FournierAlexandre","id":35603272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjAzMjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35603272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre","html_url":"https://github.com/FournierAlexandre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-19T20:09:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1433155046,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0MzMxNTUwNDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/1433155046","actor":{"login":"FournierAlexandre","id":35603272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjAzMjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35603272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre","html_url":"https://github.com/FournierAlexandre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-19T20:09:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/359516461","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/476#issuecomment-359516461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/476","id":359516461,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTUxNjQ2MQ==","user":{"login":"FournierAlexandre","id":35603272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NjAzMjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35603272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre","html_url":"https://github.com/FournierAlexandre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FournierAlexandre/orgs","repos_url":"ht

It would make sens for such a configuration.\r\n\r\nA round-robin will be more than enough, the goal is to use all card available with the same amount of VUS on each if possible.

I'm not sure what the best way to implement and expose this feature is and I'll share some of my concerns below.\r\n\r\nConfiguring the used NICs/IP addresses (and any advanced features like weights, IP per url, etc.) via new functions in k6 goes goes against the grain a bit - the current methods for configuring things are the `.json` config file, the exported `options` object, environment variables, and CLI flags (in that order). At the same time, like you mentioned, I also don't see how we can use the current configuration options effectively to express these types of very dynamic and complex things, so doing it via JS functions could give us better UX and more flexibility... I'm just raising the point since I don't know all of the implications of introducing these sort of new config dynamics.\r\n\r\nFor example, I'm not sure if those types of functions would be problematic for clustered/distributed execution or not. If they have to return the network interfaces for all machines in the cluster, it would add synchronization overhead and new dependencies and could potentially lead to one machine wanting to use the interface of another. But if they only return the individual network interfaces and addresses of each machine in the cluster, it could probably be a bit confusing since they would return different things in different k6 instances. And also one k6 instance won't know the details of the whole cluster, which could hinder some types of calculations regarding how many and which addresses should be used.\r\n\r\nAlso, should those functions be accessible only from the [init context](https://docs.k6.io/docs/test-life-cycle#section-init-and-vu-stages) or should some or all of them also be usable from the `default` function. If so, how does that affect performance and what happens with keep-alive requests when switching IPs/NICs between iterations of a VU or in the in the middle of an iteration.\r\n\r\nAnother potential concern is the cost-benefit analysis regarding complexity and where to draw the line on a new feature set like this. Since k6 is primarily a load-testing tool, the main purpose of supporting multiple NICs and IPs is probably to get more throughput and multiple source IPs. So I'm not sure if the additional complexity needed to support different weights, shrink IP ranges when certain time has elapsed, etc. would be worth it.\r\n\r\nI'm still not sure about the answers to any of those questions, I'm just raising them here to generate some discussion and ideas, so please don't get discouraged. I actually kind of like the idea of controlling that aspect of k6's execution via some API exposed to the JS runtime, the above wall of text was just me trying to semi-verbally work through all of the implications of that decision that I can think of :sweat_smile:
