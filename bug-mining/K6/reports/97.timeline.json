I did some tests. Currently this seems like a thing that is not supported. I would argue that it was previously not supported as well ... but I suppose your workaround was working.\r\n\r\n My current suggestion for workaround is either rollback to the previous stable version, especially if you don't need some of the new features or (more involved) you write your own get/post/put methods which use `http.*` to make request with [\"redirects\":0](https://docs.k6.io/docs/params-k6http) and than follow the redirect.\r\n\r\nBecause I think that this while rare case for most situation still worth supporting in some ways I have a couple of suggestion on our side:\r\n1. we can just add a field to the response that is `actual_last_url` (name to be discussied )\r\n2. we can change the current `response.url` to be last url for which this response is - I don't like this \r\n3. we can change the current `response.request.url` to be the last url that was request - I don't like this even more.\r\n4. Having an array of previous request/responses as a field. This seems like the best solution but has some problems. \r\n4.1. It will take memory, especially in cases with a lot of redirects\r\n4.2. body's can be big and we probably should save them ... again memory\r\n4.3.
