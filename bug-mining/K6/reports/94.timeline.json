would like to improve the workflow for users of Postman collections (v2.x) that want to load test their APIs using k6, provide an even better onboarding experience to k6 (and in extension Load Impact), by extending the postman-to-k6 converter to take the following Postman collection features into account in the conversion process. A completed solution will also include tests and docs (updated README).\r\n\r\n**Related issues**:\r\n- https://github.com/loadimpact/postman-to-k6/issues/7: Convert collection that uses Environment Variables\r\n- https://github.com/loadimpact/postman-to-k6/issues/12: Add support for variables in body\r\n\r\n## Cookies\r\nSetting cookies properly if they’re explicitly defined in the collection, see [docs](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/sending_api_requests/cookies).\r\n\r\n**Relevant links**:\r\n- https://docs.k6.io/docs/cookies\r\n- https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/sending_api_requests/cookies\r\n\r\n## TLS Client Certificates\r\nSetting up use of client certificates in k6 if defined in the collection, see [docs](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/sending_api_requests/certificates).\r\n\r\n**Relevant links**:\r\n- https://docs.k6.io/docs/ssl-tls-client-certificates\r\n- https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/sending_api_requests/certificates\r\n\r\n## Authentication\r\nSupport the most common authentication options supported by Postman, see [docs](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/sending_api_requests/authorization).\r\n\r\nThe authentications we want to support:\r\n\r\n- No auth (already supported in the converter)\r\n- Bearer token\r\n- HTTP Basic (already supported in the converter)\r\n- HTTP Digest\r\n- OAuth 1 / 2\r\n    - See: TODO KB example script\r\n- AWS Signature v4\r\n    - See https://support.loadimpact.com/4.0/test-scripting/examples/#aws-signature-v4-authentication (will be more performant once we have support for binary output for the hashing algorithms in the crypto package: https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/856)\r\n- NTLM Authentication\r\n\r\nThis should also include the case when the authentication is set to “Inherit auth from parent”.\r\n\r\n**Relevant links**:\r\n- https://github.com/loadimpact/postman-to-k6/tree/master/lib/postman/auth\r\n- https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/sending_api_requests/authorization\r\n\r\n## Environment/global variables\r\nSupport environment and global variables defined in the collection, see [docs](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/variables). The conversion to k6 JS must make sure to adhere to the scoping rules defined in https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/variables/#variable-scopes.\r\n\r\nIn general variables in the request URL, params, headers and body will have the form {{someVariable}}. These needs to be set by properly resolving the variable.\r\n\r\n**Relevant links**:\r\n- https://docs.k6.io/docs/environment-variables\r\n- https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/environments_and_globals/variables\r\n\r\n### Dynamic variables\r\nThe conversion needs to support Postman’s dynamic variables that can be present in the request URL, params, headers and body:\r\n- `{{$guid}}`: Adds a v4 style GUID\r\n- `{{$timestamp}}`: Adds the current timestamp\r\n- `{{$randomInt}}`: Adds a random integer between 0 and 1000\r\n\r\n### Data variables\r\nThe conversion needs to support what’s called “data variables” in Postman, see [docs](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collection_runs/working_with_data_files/). This is parameterization data loaded from a CSV or JSON file and then used in request URL, params, headers, body or pre-/post-request scripts.\r\n\r\n### In scripts\r\nIn scripts you get variables (global, environment, dynamic or data) by using one of the APIs, see Scripting below.\r\n\r\n## Scripting\r\nPostman has support for JS scripting in the form of pre-request scripts and post-response test scripts. By providing a shim layer in the converted script to support the Postman Sandbox execution environment, where pre-/post-requests scripts are executed, we should be able to provide a much more useful conversion tool from Postman to k6 for doing load testing.\r\n\r\n### Shimming\r\nThe shim layer could either be embedded in the converted script (or as a module that the converter spits out and the main file loads) or fetched from k6 github perhaps as a remote import, something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport postman from “github.com/loadimpact/k6/master/shims/postman-sandbox.js”;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pre-/Post-request scripts/tests\r\nThese are currently appended as comments in the k6 script, but will now need to be inserted into k6 verbatim, with the necessary Postman APIs made available by the shim layer. See [pre-request scripts docs](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/scripts/pre_request_scripts) and [post-request test scripts](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/scripts/test_scripts) for more info.\r\n\r\nSupport both pre-request scripts specified for a collection, a folder and an individual request (respecting the [execution order of scripts](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/scripts/intro_to_scripts/#execution-order-of-scripts)).\r\n\r\n### Postman Sandbox APIs\r\nThe following Postman Sandbox APIs needs to be supported/shimmed:\r\n\r\n- It will include making some third-party libs available by default (see list in [API docs](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/scripts/postman_sandbox_api_reference)). This could probably be handled by inserting them as imports to be loaded by the [supported CDN/Github loaders in k6](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/tree/master/loader).\r\n    - [Lodash

But in any case, I wouldn't be opposed to a `binary` result by default, if it was actually useful... The currently returned plain int array just isn't. The `Buffer` that [node's crypto](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_hash_digest_encoding) APIs return, or the [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) objects that the web crypto APIs return are way better than the plain old int arrays we return.\r\n\r\nSo in IMO we should add the `binary` encoding as an option, because we need it, but we shouldn't set a default for now.

currently don't have a good way to deal with binary data on the JS side yet :disappointed:. We rely on `[]byte` from the Go code, which translates to int arrays in JS, which is far from optimal. These are the places where we currently have binary data that I can think of:\r\n- `open(\"somefile\", \"b\")`\r\n- HTTP response bodies when the request had `{ responseType: \"binary\" }` as params\r\n- in `crypto.randomBytes()` (https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/922)\r\n- in the `crypto` hashing and digest functions (https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/952)\r\n- in the new PKI crypto functions (https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/900)\r\n- base64 encoding and decoding\r\n\r\nWe need a native analogue of the node.js [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html), or better yet - to properly support ES [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) objects. We actually have `ArrayBuffer`, the code below compiles and runs as you'd expect:\r\n```js\r\nexport default function () {\r\n    var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(16);\r\n\r\n    // Create a couple of views\r\n    var view1 = new DataView(buffer);\r\n    var view2 = new DataView(buffer, 12, 4); //from byte 12 for the next 4 bytes\r\n    view1.setInt8(12, 42); // put 42 in slot 12\r\n\r\n    console.log(view2.getInt8(0));\r\n\r\n    var z = new Int32Array(buffer, 0, 4);\r\n    console.log(z);\r\n};\r\n```\r\nbut I'm not sure if this `ArrayBuffer` comes from the bundled core.js or from goja. It [seems](https://github.com/dop251/goja/blob/master/builtin_typedarrays.go) like the `ArrayBuffer` is from goja (though I [wouldn't rely on it](https://github.com/dop251/goja/blob/master/builtin_typedarrays_test.go) very much), but the `DataView` and `Int32Array` seem to be from core.js :confused: \r\n\r\nSo we need to investigate exactly what the situation is and what we can use to handle binary data sensibly...\r\n\r\nRelated issues: https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/856, https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/874,
