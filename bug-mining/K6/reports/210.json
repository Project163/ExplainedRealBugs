Given that HTTP2 is requiring TLS for all browsers (atm) I would guess practically 100% of the traffic generated by k6 is HTTPS one.\r\n\r\n Golang does [support it since 1.8](https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/tls#example-Config-KeyLogWriter), a thing that I just now realised as I have previously looked at the [original issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13057). \r\n\r\nThis will require a some way of specifying a file to dump to ... I propose that we add a cli flag and env variable and name it as Firefox this, but with k6 in front - `K6_SSLKEYLOGFILE`. \r\n\r\nArguably this is [more involved](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2018/01/15/inspect-curls-tls-traffic/) than the `http-debug` but also has the benefits of using wireshark to debug web traffic which IMO is the more powerful option, and I would guess a familiar one for people who have needed it. \r\n\r\nThis also ... automatically negates any shortcomings of the golang stdlib on reporting what it actually sends (#774 #986  #1042) and just looks at the actual data send through the wire.","closed_by":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1043/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1043/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
