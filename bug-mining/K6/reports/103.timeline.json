better support users running tests against AWS infrastructure and to increase compatibility with Postman collections, we want to include the AWS v4 signature auth algorithm as one of the built-in auth options in k6.\r\n\r\nThe expected JS API would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport default function() {\r\n    let res = http.post(\"https://some.aws.amazon.com/api\", null,\r\n        { auth: {\r\n            type: \"awsv4\",\r\n            accessKey: _ENV.AWS_ACCESS_KEY,\r\n            secretKey: _ENV.AWS_SECRET_KEY,\r\n            service: \"s3\",\r\n            region: \"us-east-1\"\r\n         }\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following “awsv4” auth options are optional:\r\n`service`: as it can be derived from the URL host in most (all?) cases\r\n`region`: as it can be derived from the URL host in most (all?) cases\r\n\r\nThis would require the following changes to k6:\r\n- We’d need to handle `auth` request param option being either a string or an object\r\n- We’d need to add handling of “awsv4” auth as part of request processing, probably around the place where we handle Digest auth today: https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/master/lib/netext/httpext/request.go#L295\r\n- We’d need to handle parsing and matching the `service` and `region` from the URL if that’s not included in the AWS Go SDK.\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n- AWS Go SDK: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go\r\n- v4 signature code: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/blob/master/aws/signer/v4/v4.go\r\n- We’d most likely use a static provider to pass in access key and secret key:

Now instead of\r\nseparating files by whether they are scripts or no, they are separated\r\nbased on whether their URI scheme.\r\n\r\nThrough the (majority) of k6 now instead of simple strings a url.URL is\r\nused to identify files(scripts or otherwise).\r\n\r\nThis also means that all imports or `open` can have schemes.\r\nPreviously remote modules were supported specifically without scheme.\r\nWith this change we specifically prefer if they are with a scheme. The\r\nold variant is supported but logs a warning.\r\nAdditionally if remote module requires a relative/absolute path that doesn't have a\r\nscheme it is relative/absolute given the remote module url.\r\n\r\nBecause of some of the changes, now caching is done through a afero.Fs\r\ninstead of additional map. This also fixes not loаding remotely imported\r\nfiles from an archive, but instead requesting them again.\r\n\r\nfixes #1037, closes #838, fixes #887 and fixes #1051","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1059/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2522665639,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUyMjY2NTYzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/2522665639","actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-31T10:05:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2522665787,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI1MjI2NjU3ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/2522665787","actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ea8384fd9d356ae1dc3a05de8ffb34d73e312519","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/commits/ea8384fd9d356ae1dc3a05de8ffb34d73e312519","created_at":"2019-07-31T10:05:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
