What?\n\nWith the recently merged PRs to the xk6-webcrypto, the k6 core team concluded that the `k6/experimental/webcrypto` module is close to graduation and should become a part of the core even if [some functionality is missing](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-webcrypto/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aopen+label%3A%22WebCrypto+API+Compliant%22). \n\nThe idea is to make it globally available under `crypto`, like it's done in browsers and many other implementations.\n\nWe did previously the same for the timers' module, however while making `crypto` we should not fall into same trap with the

What?\r\n\r\nThis makes the setTimeout and co. timers package into a not js module package. The current one is tc55, the newly made common API to make technical committee alongside tc39. This might be changed later.\r\n\r\nThis also allows us to make them globally available without importing js module \"k6/timers\" allowing us to fix #3814.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nReporting k6/timers as always used is not good.\r\n\r\nAlso, setTimeout and co shouldn't; be dependent on being in a module.\r\n\r\nLikely more changes will happen in the future and tc55 will either grow or disappear as a package. \r\n\r\nbreaking change is set only because previously in modulestest `k6/timers` was automatically made available - I doubt anyone used that, but it is a thing.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nIf you haven't read the contributing guidelines https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md \r\nand code of conduct https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md yet, please do so\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my code.\r\n- [ ] I have added tests for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have run linter locally (`make lint`) and all checks pass.\r\n- [ ] I have run tests locally (`make tests`) and all tests pass.\r\n- [ ] I have commented on my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.\r\n<!-- - [ ] Any other relevant item -->\r\n\r\n## Related PR(s)/Issue(s)\r\n\r\n<!-- - <https://github.com/grafana/...> -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Does it close an issue? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Closes #ISSUE-ID -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for your contribution! 🙏🏼 -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/4563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/4563/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16379788480,"node_id":"CE_lADOAz4Wr86NjmQPzwAAAAPQT7zA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/16379788480","actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-20T10:20:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16379788525,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAz4Wr86NjmQPzwAAAAPQT7zt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/16379788525","actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eb9e25e0e1a4d8ea356a27b83b6a1e587516221c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/commits/eb9e25e0e1a4d8ea356a27b83b6a1e587516221c","created_at":"2025-02-20T10:20:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
