We'll make a semi-official xk6 output extension repo with the current `kafka` output code\r\n2. We'll start using that new repo as a dependency in k6 for the built-in `kafka` output (WIP PR at https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1917) in k6 v0.32.0\r\n3. The \"built-in\" `kafka` output will still continue to work for the next 2-3 k6 versions, but it will show a deprecation warning to stop using it and point users to the xk6 kafka extension instead.\r\n4. We will make improvements only to the kafka output extension, we won't change the k6 built-in one.\r\n5. After 2-3 k6 versions (e.g. in k6 v0.34.0), we will completely drop the \"built-in\" `kafka` output.","closed_by":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1934/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1934/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
