tight coupling is preventing us from implementing `group()` and `check()` purely in JavaScript. It is also preventing us from implementing similar functions, but with better UX (e.g. https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/1066, https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2865) or that work better with `async` / `await` (https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2848, https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2728)\r\n\r\nThe tight coupling can be removed with only a very small loss of efficiency, by just having the `MetricEngine` process `check`  and `group_duration` metrics as they appear and group them based on their `group` tag.
