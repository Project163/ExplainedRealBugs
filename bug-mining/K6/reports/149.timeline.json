better like to understand K6s behaviour in relation to DNS caching.\r\n\r\nI’m trying to run tests against a couple of load balanced K8S clusters. The failover is managed by a traffic manager so once the traffic manager has detected a failure in one of the clusters it will update the DNS records so that traffic only hits the healthy cluster. I’ve tried to reduce the problem, described below.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a performance test to run for 5m against a particular endpoint. E.g., https://gist.github.com/paulgrav/a8b6d77639b0d54774b499c5dfd660c6\r\n2. Ensure that `host.name` points to a CNAME that returns HTML and has a TTL of 60s.\r\n3. Run the test.\r\n4. After one minute, update the CNAME for `host.name` to a domain that doesn’t resolve e.g., `foo.bar.asdf`\r\n\r\n# Actual results:\r\n\r\nAll HTTP calls in the test succeed despite the CNAME record being changed to point to a domain that doesn’t resolve.\r\n\r\n# Expected results:\r\n\r\nAfter 60s but before the test ends, there should be some test failures because the HTTP requests fail.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/726/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-12T08:04:58Z","updated_at":"2019-07-12T08:04:58Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1079","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1079/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1079/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1079/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/1079","id":467277752,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NjcyNzc3NTI=","number":1079,"title":"Replace

#1059 it became obvious [afero](https://github.com/spf13/afero) has some problems specifically with it's [MemMapFs](https://github.com/spf13/afero/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+memmapfs), but also missing features in [CacheOnReadFs](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/6b08d619bc6b65352bf4238966be37729f962e81/lib/fsext/cacheonread.go), problems with

the cleanest (and I would argue very good) solution is for MemMapFs to be rewritten in a way that it fixes all it's bugs and is in general not hacky, I propose that we fork afero and use the [go modules](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1070) [replace](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#when-should-i-use-the-replace-directive) functionality. We should still try to merge all the fixes in the original repo, but unfortunately it looks pretty dead to me so it will probably take a while ... \r\n\r\nThis is definitely not *high* priority, as the current workarounds work, but it will still make the experience of using MemMapFs and afero much less error-prone and with less hacks.

why a user was running out of memory running a simple script after some time, I discovered that apparently influxdb leaks memory ... :(.

I am under the impression that maybe the library shouldn't be used like that, but just in case (and because it will be way quicker) I would like to update the dependancy and test again. Unfortunately due to some influxdb refactoring (and probably the new version 2) It has changed repos ;( to https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb1-client . So maybe if we had been using [modules](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1070) that would've been easy again :(

for release notes:\r\n\r\n> Influxdb refactoring:\r\n> the InfluxDB output has been updated to use less memory and try to send smaller and consistent chunks of data to InfluxDB in order to not drop packages and use less memory. This is primarily done by sending data in parallel as this seems to be better from performance perspective and more importantly queuing data in separate packages so we don't send the data for a very long period at a time. Also the library used was updated which also decreased the memory usage as well.\r\n> \r\n> Two new options were added:\r\n> K6_INFLUXDB_PUSH_INTERVAL - configures at what interval the collected data is queued to be send to InfluxDB.  By default this is \"1s\". \r\n> K6_INFLUXDB_CONCURRENT_WRITES - configures the amount of concurrent write calls to InfluxDB. If this limit is reached the next writes will be queued and made when a slot is freed. By default this is 10.\r\n>

PR adds support for a [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/) collector.\r\n\r\nI've included the JSON source for a Grafana dashboard that has a couple of more features than the ones available for InfluxDB:\r\n\r\n![grafana-open-source-load-testing-stack](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1792533/68465067-07198000-0212-11ea-8c80-497aac67f1d1.png)\r\n\r\nWith this PR I also propose we make TimescaleDB the \"default\" collector over InfluxDB for the Docker Compose setup for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- SQL is waay easier and more powerful than InfluxQL, and I personally didn't want to invest the time to learn yet another query language if I would have instead opted for InfluxData's [Flux language](https://github.com/influxdata/flux) that they support in newer versions of InfluxDB.\r\n- TimescaleDB (and PostgreSQL) is something we have much more knowledge about internally than InfluxDB given that we operate TimescaleDB for our cloud service.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] ~Figure out how to add [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) as a dependency as I'm running into issues with `dep ensure` and [the author seems to be suggesting using Go modules](https://github.com/jackc/pgx/issues/628) (related to https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1070)~\r\n- [ ] Write tests for the collector\r\n- [ ] Write docs for using the collector\r\n- [ ]

fixes.\r\n\r\nThere are some minor differences between `go.mod` and the previous `Gopkg.lock`. The missing packages are indirect and seem fine, and the version differences shouldn't cause problems, but let me know if they should be explicitly overriden.\r\n\r\n- In `go.mod` but not in `Gopkg.lock`:\r\n```\r\ngithub.com/Shopify/toxiproxy v2.1.4+incompatible // indirect  (from github.com/Shopify/sarama)\r\ngithub.com/google/go-cmp v0.5.1 // indirect                   (from
