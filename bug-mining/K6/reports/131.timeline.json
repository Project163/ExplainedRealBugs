And it can be either the source or the destination machine. After all, 5000/10000 VUs (i.e. JavaScript runtimes) and concurrent network connections are quite a lot. Something that is indicative of this is that with 5000 VUs, k6 managed to open 4907 sessions (98.1%), while with 10000 VUs it opened only 8676 (86.7%). \r\n\r\nSome questions to help debug this and suggestions what to try:\r\n- What are the CPU/RAM/networks specs of the machine you ran those tests on? \r\n- When you launched k6 with both tests, what percentage of those resources was \"eaten\" by it?\r\n- What happens when you increase the test `duration`? The current dialing timeout in k6 [is 30 seconds](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/d219b19a0353ddc73063ff3c45bc17444f0771c3/js/runner.go#L91), so that, added to any delays and roundtrips in the actual websocket communication, means that those 2 minutes may very well pass before an actual connection is established. That way the VU may be running, but `session_counter` won't be incremented.\r\n- What happens when you try the same test with 3000 VUs?\r\n- What happens when instead of starting all of the VUs simultaneously, you ramp them up gradually via the `stages` option? Something like this:\r\n  ```js\r\n  export let options = {\r\n    stages: [\r\n        { duration: \"2m\", target: 5000 }, // Linearly ramp up from 1 to 5000 VUs over 2 minutes\r\n        { duration: \"2m\", target: 5000 }, // Stay at 5000 VUs for 2 more minutes\r\n    ]\r\n  };\r\n  ```\r\n  Or maybe add a random sleep between 1 and 10 seconds before the `ws.connect()` call, so each VU doesn't simultaneously try to talk to the remote server. After all, 10000 simultaneous connection attempts is bound to get messy.\r\n- When you say _\"active socket connection count to my backend and tracked that number real time\"_, do you mean that you tracked the number of actual network connections at the OS level, or the number of established websocket connections at the application level?\r\n\r\n> And as an extra question, I also want to handle the socket connection errors to re-open that connection after an error to keep the session going. But I didn't see on the documantation page. I want to make my tests as real as possible and if a client loses its socket connection, it usually re-opens the connection.\r\n\r\nYour current code should already do that :slightly_smiling_face: k6 works by having each active VU loop through the exported `default` function over and over again, until the test `iterations` or `duration` or `stages` run out and the test ends. So in your case, if the `ws.connect()` call ends, the next script iteration will start, making that VU connect to the server again. Although there's currently a [bug](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/581) in the websocket handling code that causes k6 to get stuck in some situations...\r\n\r\n> And from the documantation I was hoping to see default ws metrics to be on the result screen but for some reason I am not seeing, that is the reason I am counting every event manually.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why I tagged the issue as `bug`/`refactoring`. It is partially caused by your code clashing with some k6 semantics, but it's also because of an unfinished refactoring on my part. Some background:\r\n- As I mentioned above, k6 currently works through [looping VUs](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6#running-k6) that iterate over the `default` function.\r\n- All HTTP requests and websocket connections in k6 are measured and different metrics are emitted. Those are then used to calculate the summary results at the end of the test.\r\n- k6 intentionally [discards](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/d219b19a0353ddc73063ff3c45bc17444f0771c3/core/local/local.go#L198-L214) any metrics that were generated after the test duration (2 minutes in this case) has passed.\r\n- Your script doesn't finish even a single iteration (notice the `No data generated, because no script iterations finished` warning) because for the whole script duration, each VU is stuck inside of the `ws.connect()` call, until k6 kills it at the end of the test.\r\n- Websocket metrics are unfortunately [emitted only after the websocket is closed](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/d219b19a0353ddc73063ff3c45bc17444f0771c3/js/modules/k6/ws/ws.go#L277-L321)... In your case, that means that they're either not emitted at all (if `socket.done` wasn't triggered) or sent after the test duration has passed (and thus discarded).\r\n\r\nThat last one is definitely a bug, and it's something I overlooked when I was refactoring the k6 metrics to be emitted in real-time in [this pull request](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/678). All of the websocket metrics except `ws_session_duration` should actually be emitted as soon as they happen, not when the socket is closed...\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/450642259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/450648678","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/885#issuecomment-450648678","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/885","id":450648678,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDY0ODY3OA==","user":{"login":"gcg","id":811685,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTY4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/811685?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcg","html_url":"https://github.com/gcg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gcg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-31T13:58:26Z","updated_at":"2018-12-31T13:58:26Z","body":"Wow, thank you @na--  for the explanations, I will go thru them point by point and share with you the results.
