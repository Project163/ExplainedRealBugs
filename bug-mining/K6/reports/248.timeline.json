our case we test a little over 150 endpoints in over 50 scenarios. Some of our endpoints trigger differently optimized stored procedures on the database side depending on what query parameters are passed. In other cases, we have endpoints that do different things depending on the payload passed in and have different performance profiles based on the same (not the best design, I know, but what we have to live with for now). Further, different scenarios might call the same endpoint and sometimes we want to keep track of the originating scenario. For example, we might need to call search endpoint as if it was used by individual user and also call it in different scenario as if it was called by user from a support center.\r\n\r\nWe generate custom Trend metrics to keep track of these things, as we care about aggregate performance over the duration of the test more so than any individual call. We start off by using our routes file to name metrics by the HTTP request type, and route (so GET /gateway/api/search for example, which we'll have to modify when this change goes into effect). Then, depending on if we need to keep track of scenario that called the metric and parameters, we append that information to the metric name after white space and some separator, for example - character. This gives us easy to read and process metric results in k6-reporter where engineer can see what endpoint was called, as well as what scenario was used and what underlying functionality was targeted. It makes tracking performance problems much easier in our workflow, we end up using a little over 160 custom metrics and may want to expand that further.\r\n\r\nWe also use _ character to identify id placeholders in the URI, so with that becoming only allowed non number/letter character we'd have to account for that as well.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, I can certainly understand the desire to support a single standard.

sorry for dropping the ball on this conversation :(.\r\n\r\n> Several longer metric names we have triggered the warning. Is the intent to limit metric name length going forward as well?\r\n\r\nThis was mostly done as originally we kept the 128 characters limit that we had up until then, before [it was pointed out](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3066#discussion_r1192078711) that Otel limits them to 63. \r\n\r\nThat has since change and I just bumped it to 128 again in #3335. And we might bump it to 255. I also decided to add the 128 character restriction in the message, but still keep it short :crossed_fingers: \r\n\r\n\r\nOn the previous comment: \r\n\r\nWhat do you use for this metrics? Again this restrictions are to align us with prometheus and Otel and looking at some other names in the industry:\r\n1. [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/custom_metrics/#naming-custom-metrics) has periods as well and then converts a bunch of stuff to `_` which IMO is worse\r\n2. Influxdb doesn't have any restrictions (which breaks a bunch of integrations from the thing I looked at) but they have a list of [*recommendations*](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/#what-words-and-characters-should-i-avoid-when-writing-data-to-influxdb) so that you don't shoot yourself in the foot. \r\n3.
