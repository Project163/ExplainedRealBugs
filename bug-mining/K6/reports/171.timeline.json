does add an interface that can be implemented by other outputs as well.\r\n\r\nfixes #1880\r\n\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n- [ ] Figure out a good name. I kept changing what I think this should be called through the writing of this and am not certain I like any of the names much ... I would argue that the best one is `StopExecutionOnOutputSignal` as it makes it more accurate that we will over stop if the output couldn't be started, and that this is a signal from the output to *stop* not just that there was some error. Unfortunately, it's a bit of a mouthful\r\n- [ ] Figure out how to write an integration test of this ... I have tested it manually and it works (and takes 3 minutes to test) but it will be nice to have a full integration test about this.\r\n- [ ] Print which output signaled to close \r\n\r\n\r\nRelated to the last point,  I decided to have an error be \"returned\" not just to call some function is so that we can *always* print it in some good known format instead of it being a responsibility of the output.
