thing I've noticed when creating tests is that it would be nice to extend the options from modules in an easy way, especially thresholds in my case.\r\n\r\nTo show an example of what I mean, let's say we have a main.js like so:\r\n```js\r\nimport { group } from \"k6\";\r\nimport http from \"k6/http\";\r\n\r\n// Units/Pages\r\nimport { testIndexPage } from \"./units/index.js\";\r\n\r\n// Options\r\nexport let options = {\r\n    stages: [\r\n        { duration: \"30s\", target: 10 },\r\n        { duration: \"30s\" },\r\n        { duration: \"30s\", target: 0 }\r\n    ]\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Scenario\r\nexport default function() {\r\n    group(\"Front page\", function() {\r\n        testIndexPage();\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand a index.js file in a units/ sub directory:\r\n```js\r\nimport { check, group, options  } from \"k6\";\r\nimport http from \"k6/http\";\r\n\r\n// Constants\r\nconst baseURL = __ENV.BASE_URL || \"http://test.loadimpact.com\";\r\nconst mainURL = `${baseURL}/`;\r\nconst thresholdP95 = 100;\r\n\r\n// Options\r\nlet pageThresholds = {};\r\npageThresholds[`http_req_duration{url:${mainURL}}`] = [`p(95)<${thresholdP95}`];\r\n\r\noptions.extend(\"thresholds\", pageThresholds);\r\n\r\n// Tests\r\nexport function testIndexPage() {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default function() {\r\n    testIndexPage();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI'd like to be able to do something along the lines of what is done on line 13 in index.js above (`options.extend(\"thresholds\", pageThresholds)`, with `options` imported from `\"k6\"`).\r\n\r\nSpecifying options using `options.extend(...)` should be possible to use as an alternative to the top-module `export let options = {...};`, meaning index.js should work both as a module/unit used in a larger test and as a standalone test case.\r\n\r\nThe solution I've used thus far is to export the `pageThresholds` and then merge thresholds from several modules into one JS object that gets set as the `thresholds` option.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/240/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ppcano","id":825430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTQzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/825430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppcano","html_url":"https://github.com/ppcano","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppcano/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppcano/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppcano/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppcano/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppcano/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppcano/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppcano/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppcano/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ppcano/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-16T09:50:34Z","updated_at":"2017-06-16T09:50:34Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/251","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/251/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/251/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/251/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/251","id":236225082,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzYyMjUwODI=","number":251,"title":"Missing

sleep(ms/1000);\r\n    callback();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there any way to do

off, apologies for using an issue for questions - the Slack invite linked on k6.io states that it is no longer valid.\r\n\r\nI have a working script created with v0.12.2. Upon upgrading to v0.17.0 there are three major issues:\r\n\r\n1. `import { checkGet, checkPost, checkAuthenticate } from './general';` has to be changed to `import { checkGet, checkPost, checkAuthenticate } from './general.js';` (note the .js)\r\n2. `Object.assign` now results in `TypeError: Object has no member 'assign`\r\n3. I had been creating a `json_body` member of `res` (code below). The reason for doing this vs using `res.json()` is it makes it convenient to have a default empty {} object so downstream checks can validate against it. With `.json()` those checks would fail. This now results in `TypeError: Cannot assign to property json_body of a host object` however. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction getJsonBodyChecks(res, expectedContentType) {\r\n\tlet jsonBodyCheck = {};\r\n\t\r\n\tif('application/json' === expectedContentType) {\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tres.json_body = JSON.parse(res.body);\r\n\t\t} catch(e) {\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tjsonBodyCheck = {\r\n\t\t\t'body is JSON'\t: (r) => 'object' === typeof(r.json_body),\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\treturn jsonBodyCheck;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ... down the line ...\r\nexport function checkGet(endpoint, additionalChecks = {}, expectedContentType='application/json' ) {\r\n\tconst res = http.get(\r\n\t\tEndpoints[endpoint], \r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\theaders : getBaseHeaders()\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t);\r\n\r\n\tconst allChecks = Object.assign(\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t'status was 200'\t\t\t: (r) => r.status === 200,\r\n\t\t\t'transaction time OK'\t\t: (r) => r.timings.duration < 200,\r\n\t\t\t'content-type OK'\t\t\t: (r) => r.headers['Content-Type'] && r.headers['Content-Type'].startsWith(expectedContentType),\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\tgetJsonBodyChecks(res, expectedContentType),\r\n\t\tadditionalChecks\r\n\t);\r\n\r\n\tcheck(res, allChecks);\r\n\r\n\treturn res;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease advise on alternatives/workarounds!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1196126557,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTE5NjEyNjU1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/1196126557","actor":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"c9ab90b25e873af8ca2a4461d4396fcc9db346e6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/commits/c9ab90b25e873af8ca2a4461d4396fcc9db346e6","created_at":"2017-08-07T20:56:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
