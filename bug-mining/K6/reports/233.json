Brief summary\n\nThe `k6/ws` module's 'connect` doesn't emit `WSSessionDuraiton` if there is exception the first callback it has.\r\n\r\nGiven that at that point k6 will emit `ws_sessions` (and `ws_connecting) (since 0.27.1 at least) - it seems reasonable to also emit `ws_session_duration` \r\n\r\nThis was noticed while rewriting test for lint issues and it turn out [one of them](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2732#discussion_r996756991) was checking for this, but was getting false possitive due to reusage of test setup. \n\n### k6 version\n\nv0.40.0\n\n### OS\n\nlinux\n\n### Docker version and image (if applicable)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Steps to reproduce the problem\n\nrun \r\n```\r\nimport ws from 'k6/ws';\r\n\r\nexport default function() {\r\n  let url = `wss://test-api.k6.io/ws/crocochat/test/`;\r\n\r\n  let res = ws.connect(url, function(socket) { throw \"oops\" });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously the real code will be probably something that fails with an exception then actually just throwing within ;)\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nEmit all the three ws metrics even with very low valuse\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nemitting 2 of the 3 metrics","closed_by":{"login":"imiric","id":1009277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDkyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1009277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric","html_url":"https://github.com/imiric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2734/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
