currently exploring this issue, and would like to confirm the requirements.\r\n\r\nAs discussed briefly over Slack with @na--, the trend count should be displayed immediately after the trend name and colon, as the first column, without a column name, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n    iterations.................: 1      1.615195/s\r\n    my_trend...................: 12345  avg=309.5    min=266      med=309.5    max=353      p(90)=344.3    p(95)=348.65\r\n    vus........................: 1      min=1 max=1\r\n    vus_max....................: 1      min=1 max=1\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this should only be displayed for user-created metrics, not any of the built-in trend metrics like `http_req_blocked`, `http_req_connecting`, etc., correct?\r\n\r\nIf yes, that makes sense, but would skew the column alignment of this row compared to the other trend metrics. Should we care about this and pad the other rows with blank space to match?\r\n\r\nBut more important than this alignment issue is that I currently don't see an easy way of distinguishing user-created metrics from built-in ones [when rendering the results](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/2dbf69559f48cf0c32e27245843800b050fbcfca/ui/summary.go#L277). Is there an existing way of doing this (besides checking metric names), or should we add another field to `stats.Metric` like `UserCreated bool` or something similar for this purpose? I don't like this approach, so I'm hoping there's an easier method.\r\n\r\nIf no (i.e. the count should be shown for built-in metrics as well), then that avoids the above two issues, but it doesn't make much sense to show, since the count will likely be the same for all and `http_reqs` already shows that.\r\n\r\nAlso, one minor question: should we display the column name in addition to the value? E.g. `count=12345`. This would make it consistent with the other values, and perhaps more readable.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/527194561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imiric","id":1009277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDkyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1009277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric","html_url":"https://github.com/imiric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2601494104,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYwMTQ5NDEwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/2601494104","actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-02T16:05:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2601494106,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MDE0OTQxMDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/2601494106","actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-02T16:05:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/527361827","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/1087#issuecomment-527361827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1087","id":527361827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNzM2MTgyNw==","user":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-03T08:34:52Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T08:35:37Z","body":"> And this should only be displayed for user-created metrics, not any of the built-in trend metrics like `http_req_blocked`, `http_req_connecting`, etc., correct?\r\n\r\nHmm a very good question... My gut feeling is that we should display this for all `Trend` metrics, both custom and built-in ones. However, there will be tons and tons of duplication with the different `http_req_*` metrics, they will all have the same count :confused: What's more, as you've mentioned, we already have a separate `Counter` metric called `http_reqs` that displays this exact same count... \r\n\r\nSo, unfortunately, it seems like we'd either have to:\r\n   1. Distinguish between `Trend` metrics for which we should display counts, and thread metrics for which we shouldn't. And that's not necessarily the same as distinguishing between user/custom and built-in metrics, because while showing the counts for the `http_req_*` metrics would be mostly repetitive and useless, the same cannot be said for all [built-in metrics](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/master/lib/metrics/metrics.go). For example, `group_duration`, `ws_ping`, `ws_connecting`, and probably some future ones (https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/921, https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/888, https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/851 among others).\r\n   It's also worth pointing out that even if we do this, it would only affect the current human-readable end of test summary. We probably should always output the `count` value for all `Trend` metrics in the upcoming JSON output of the end-of-test summary stats (https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/355).\r\n\r\n  2. (my currently preferred solution) Figure out a non-annoying way to display the duplicate information, so we won't need to distinguish between the different `Trend` metrics. My initial suggestion of having the count immediately after the metric name and colon won't work, since displaying the most useless information in the most visible space would be stupid :sweat_smile: . But if we place it last and add the `count` column name as you suggested, it might work. Here's an example about how this would look like with the [thresholds example](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6#checks-and-thresholds) from the README (with an extra custom time `Trend` metric):\r\n```\r\n  ✓ check_failure_rate.........: 0.00%   ✓ 0    ✗ 1745\r\n    checks.....................: 100.00% ✓ 4363 ✗ 0   \r\n    data_received..............: 4.7 MB  67 kB/s\r\n    data_sent..................: 238 kB  3.4 kB/s\r\n    group_duration.............: avg=151ms    min=137.81ms med=148.53ms max=937.56ms p(90)=154.42ms p(95)=156.84ms  count=824\r\n    http_req_blocked...........: avg=8.48ms   min=1.13µs   med=2.81µs   max=585.59ms p(90)=5.09µs   p(95)=6.84µs    count=2617  \r\n    http_req_connecting........: avg=2.79ms   min=0s       med=0s       max=189.75ms p(90)=0s       p(95)=0s        count=2617  \r\n  ✓ http_req_duration..........: avg=149.09ms min=135.37ms med=147.71ms max=937.21ms p(90)=154.01ms p(95)=156.44ms  count=2617  \r\n    ✓ { staticAsset:yes }......: avg=149.72ms min=135.37ms med=147.77ms max=937.21ms p(90)=153.43ms p(95)=156.14ms  count=1648    \r\n    http_req_receiving.........: avg=449.14µs min=39.82µs  med=129.46µs max=148.99ms p(90)=323.54µs p(95)=642.32µs  count=2617  \r\n    http_req_sending...........: avg=58.36µs  min=9.22µs   med=48.69µs  max=404.67µs p(90)=99.9µs   p(95)=128.44µs  count=2617  \r\n    http_req_tls_handshaking...: avg=5.67ms   min=0s       med=0s       max=398.18ms p(90)=0s       p(95)=0s        count=2617  \r\n    http_req_waiting...........: avg=148.58ms min=135.24ms med=147.34ms max=937.12ms p(90)=153.2ms  p(95)=155.74ms  count=2617  \r\n    http_reqs..................: 2617    37.38567/s\r\n    iteration_duration.........: avg=3.81s    min=2.29s    med=3.77s    max=5.71s    p(90)=5s       p(95)=5.14s     count=824  \r\n    iterations.................: 824     11.771415/s\r\n    my_custom_trend............: avg=149.76ms min=135.37ms med=147.4ms  max=937.21ms p(90)=152.98ms p(95)=155.74ms  count=123  \r\n    vus........................: 50      min=5  max=50\r\n    vus_max....................: 50      min=50 max=50\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot great, but not super annoying either... Notice that the subset of `http_req_duration` with the `staticAsset` tag has a different count, which is useful to know. And this specific script just has a single group, but generally the count of the `group_duration` metric would be different than the `count` of `iterations`. \r\n\r\nSo, in summary, I think we should always display the count, even if there's some repetition, just in a maximally unobtrusive way. What's more, I'm not sure we should always emit all `http_req_*` metrics. It will be a minor breaking change, but it's currently a bit strange that we emit `http_req_tls_handshaking=0` for plaintext HTTP requests...\r\n\r\n@MStoykov, @cuonglm - thoughts?\r\n\r\n> If yes, that makes sense, but would skew the column alignment of this row compared to the other trend metrics.

adds an optional `count` column for Trend metrics in the CLI summary output, while refactoring parts of `ui/summary.go` for code style (avoiding globals, explicit validation, etc.) and negligible performance improvements (using a map for column lookups).\r\n\r\nTo enable it run e.g. `k6 run --summary-trend-stats 'avg,p(99.99),count' test.js`.\r\n\r\nThis essentially makes the existing default Count metrics like \"http_reqs\" and \"iterations\" obsolete, so we might want to consider making `count` a default column after all and removing these two metrics from the output.\r\n\r\nI added a
