you make HTTP requests with redirects, the `name` tag in the generated metrics is wrong - it contains the original URL... For example, if you run the following script:\r\n```js\r\nimport http from 'k6/http';\r\n\r\nexport default function () {\r\n    http.get(\"https://httpbin.test.k6.io/redirect-to?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.test.k6.io%2Fanything\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith `k6 run --out json=results.json script.js`, and then filter the generated metrics with to get the `url` tags with `jq '. | select(.type==\"Point\" and .metric == \"http_reqs\") | .data.tags.url' results.json`, you'd get this:\r\n```\r\n\"https://httpbin.test.k6.io/redirect-to?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.test.k6.io%2Fanything\"\r\n\"https://httpbin.test.k6.io/anything\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is perfectly fine, but if you get the `name` tag with `jq '. | select(.type==\"Point\" and .metric == \"http_reqs\") | .data.tags.name' results.json`, you'd get:\r\n```\r\n\"https://httpbin.test.k6.io/redirect-to?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.test.k6.io%2Fanything\"\r\n\"https://httpbin.test.k6.io/redirect-to?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttpbin.test.k6.io%2Fanything\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we had explicitly specified such a `name` tag, or anything other in the `http.get()` `params`, it would be fine. But in this case, the result of these 2 commands should have been identical...\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this in the cloud is even worse, since the [`name` tag is used for request grouping](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/http-requests#url-grouping), it looks like this:\r\n![Screenshot_2020-05-29 Test run 739754 - app k6 io](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3336773/83229878-6f6d8600-a191-11ea-96a7-0bee4c468062.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imiric","id":1009277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDkyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1009277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric","html_url":"https://github.com/imiric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
