Feature Description\r\n\r\nHello,\r\nIn my organization InfluxDB cluster is not available for direct connections from certain locations, but it is possible using a proxy.\r\nI tried to use a command like this:\r\n```\r\nHTTP_PROXY=proxy:3128 HTTPS_PROXY=proxy:3128 k6 run /tests/generic_endpoint.js --out influxdb=$K6_INFLUXDB_URL:$K6_INFLUXDB_PORT/$K6_INFLUXDB_DATABASE\r\n```\r\nbut it looks like k6 uses those vars only for the testing requests. I also tried to export those vars, but got the same results. But even if it would work like that, it is still not a good solution since I don't want to send my requests through the same proxy.\r\n\r\n### Suggested Solution (optional)\r\n\r\nAdd the K6_INFLUXDB_PROXY env var\r\n\r\n### Already existing or connected issues / PRs (optional)\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/3418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/3418/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
