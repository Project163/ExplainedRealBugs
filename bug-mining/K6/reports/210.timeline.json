Feature Description\r\nCurrently if you are using https you have only `--http-debug=full` to see what the request/response are ... this is not terrible, but given that it has issues and that with big or binary response/request it is nearly unusable, I would argue that it is better if users can use wireshark(or other tools with similar capabilities).\r\n\r\nLuckily for some time now (go1.8) golang has support to dump the tls keys it uses in a [format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/Key_Log_Format) that wireshark [understands](https://jimshaver.net/2015/02/11/decrypting-tls-browser-traffic-with-wireshark-the-easy-way/).\r\n\r\nSo I propose we add a flag to enable logging those keys to a file using the [tls.KeyLogger](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#example_Config_keyLogWriter)\r\n\r\nA [repo with a basic implementation and

#1043 \r\n\r\nDuring some of the previous discussions we really wanted to close the file at the end of the test. Unfortunately there isn't really a good way for this currently and arguably it will take a lot of time so the solutions (AFAIK) are:\r\n1. don't close the file - in this case we can just open it in `js.Runner` and give it to all `VUs`. The file will be closed when the process exits, possibly not flushing a line ... I guess (although os.File is not buffered by default). \r\n2. Wait for a rewrite to get us a signal for \"k6 is stopping\" to close the file. This arguably is connected with way too many other life-time issues in k6 and is unlikely to be easy to fix. \r\n3. Move this outside of the `js` package and push it in. This in practice will mean more arguments, but may let us do it in `cmd/run.go` for example :shrug:, Which does know when a k6 will stop executing\r\n4. Do some \"reference counting\" on activation and deactivation of VUs and open/close the file when appropriate - what this PR does.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2485/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6387780615,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAz4Wr84bBXjlzwAAAAF8vcwH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/6387780615","actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-07T11:56:00Z","label":{"name":"good
