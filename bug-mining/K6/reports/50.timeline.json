think that there probably are at least a few dependencies we could prune in the future. For example, it looks like removing `golang.org/x/net/http2` may be possible. It was added in [this commit](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/commit/37c8efd966920e9af40e4e0c4692496d2809eb17), but the tests still passed after removing the import and the line `_ = http2.ConfigureTransport(transport)`. I assume that the [issue](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/268) may have been caused by an older Go version, though I'll have to investigate thoroughly to be sure. It may be worth it to go through all of the direct dependencies at least and check if they are still necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
