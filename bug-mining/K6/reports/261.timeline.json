What? \r\n\r\nHave `open` , `k6/experimental/fs.open` and `k6/net/grpc.Client#load` be relative to the same path for each execution.\r\n\r\nOr at least specify and stick to one new norm among them and anything else related to loading files.\r\n\r\n### Why? \r\n\r\nConsistency, ease of reasoning, also potentially debugging and using one in place of the other.\r\n\r\n### Current situation:\r\n\r\n`k6/experimental/fs.open` and `k6/net/grpc.Client#load`  are relative to the entry point of `k6` - so either the folder of the argument to `run` or if is `-` (stdin) - the folder k6 is executed in.\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure this was a mistake in gRPC  (#2781). `fs.open` was [more](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3165#discussion_r1302659695) of \"let's not make this more complicated especially given this is an experimental module\".\r\n\r\n`open` on the other hand is relative to the currently executed file, but I would argue by design it was supposed to be relative to the file it is called in. Similar to how `require` (previously [buggy](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3534)) is defined, and also how `import`s both static and dynamic usually work in ECMAScript. And how they are actually now implemented.\r\n\r\nSo for me this seems like a bug all around.\r\n\r\n### Examples of the behaviour:\r\nIf we have the following structure\r\n```\r\n/root/main.js\r\n/path/A.JS\r\n/path/B/B.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nmain.js:\r\n```javascript\r\nimport \"/path/A.JS\"\r\n```\r\nA.js\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { openHelper, fsOpenHelper } from \"./B/B.js\";\r\nimport fs from \"k6/experimental/fs\";\r\nopen(\"./some/path/file.csv\") // this is /path/some/path/file.csv - which seems pretty correct\r\nfs.open(\"./some/path/file.csv\") // this is /root/some/path/file.csv - which isn't the worst ... but still confusing\r\n// same for grpc \r\nopenHelper(\"./some/path/file.csv\") // this is /path/some/path/file.csv - which is ... quite impossible to guess\r\nfsOpenHelper(\"./some/path/file.csv\") // this is /root/some/path/file.csv - at least this is consistent\r\n```\r\nB.js\r\n```javascript\r\nimport fs from \"k6/experimental/fs\";\r\n\r\nexport function openHelper(s) { open(s) }\r\nexport function fsOpenHelper(s) { fs.open(s) }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case the `openHelper` is arguably the \"good\" example for the current behaviour, but if you wanted to have helper that does something completely different but as part of it it opens \r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nexport function checkSomethingExists(id) {\r\n    return open(\"./some/path/to/file.json\")[id]\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nThat relative path will be relative to whatever calls `checkSomethingExists` as in the example above.\r\n\r\n### Proposal: \r\n\r\nChange all of them to be relative to the file being called in - how imports and require work.\r\n\r\nGiven that the three currently have 3 different behaviours and only on of them is experimental - we will need to have at least a couple of releases with warnings about this.\r\n\r\nI recommend we do the same as with `require` - test that the new implementation will not give a different result (which is possible in some cases) and only if it isn't - then emit a warning.\r\n\r\nWe can also recommend using https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3856 if it is implemented at the time.\r\n\r\nThe existance of `import.meta.resolve` doesn't change the fact that the functions having different things they are relative to is a confusing behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Related issues and PRs

What?\r\n\r\nThis implements and tests `import.meta.resolve()` a way to get the path to a module the same way ESM and/or `require` will do.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't read or load the file in question from the file.\r\n\r\nThis also showed that we currently always parse code as ECMAScript modules. Even when the parsed/compiled file was to be wrapped as CommonJS.\r\n\r\nThis likely had no other side effects as all other ESM specific syntax is also either not implemented in k6 or forces CommonJS wrapping disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nThis lets people use `open`, `require` , `experimental/fs.open`, etc. and have a way to always be relative to the module it is written in. \r\n\r\nThe fixes to compiler were as otherwise CommonJS modules don't error on `import.meta` and doesn't just isn't supported in the standard.\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nIf you haven't read the contributing guidelines https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md \r\nand code of conduct https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md yet, please do so\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my code.\r\n- [ ] I have added tests for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have run linter locally (`make lint`) and all checks pass.\r\n- [ ] I have run tests locally (`make tests`) and all tests pass.\r\n- [ ] I have commented on my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.\r\n<!-- -
