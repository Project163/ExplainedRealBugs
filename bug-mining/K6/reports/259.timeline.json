What?\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request contains a fix for the sample flags values being incorrect when using the tracing module's Jaeger propagator.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nAs reported by @Blinkuu, the sampling option of the tracing module did not set the trace header flags correctly. That led to traces not being sampled, regardless of the options set on the `instrumentHTTP` called.\r\n\r\nThis was caused by the constant values defining the sampled/unsampled flags being inverted. This Pull Request sets their values back to their specified values. It also adds tests ensuring that we observe the correct flags from the propagators `Propagate` methods under various conditions.  \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nIf you haven't read the

Background\r\n\r\nIn the [Open Telemetry API](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/trace/api/#) a `Span` represents a single operation within a trace. Spans can be nested to form a trace tree. Each trace contains a root span, which typically describes the entire operation and, optionally, one or more sub-spans for its sub-operations.\r\n\r\nA span is said to be a root span if it does not have a parent. Each trace includes a single root span, which is the shared ancestor of all other spans in the trace. Implementations MUST provide an option to create a Span as a root span, and MUST generate a new `TraceId` for each root span created.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nIn the discussion that follows we will be using the following example as a reference. It describes the whole journey of a user in a shop. The user logs in, browses the catalog, adding products to the cart, and then checks out. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction userJourney() {\r\n      // start of journey\r\n      http.post()  // login\r\n      \r\n      // browse catalogue and add to cart\r\n      http.get();\r\n      http.get()\r\n      http.put()\r\n       \r\n      // checkout\r\n      http.get()\r\n      http.post()\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n##  Problem\r\n\r\nPresently, the `experimental/tracing` module generates `traceIDs` for each HTTP request and propagates them using an HTTP header. The resulting trace tree for the example will be:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n- root span\r\n   |- post\r\n- root span\r\n   |- get\r\n- root span\r\n   |- get\r\n- root span\r\n   |- put\r\n- root span\r\n   |- get\r\n - root span\r\n   |- post\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feature is useful to allow distributed tracing of each individual request.  However, for more complex tests, it is customary to group requests that model a user journey in order to collect metrics such as error rates.\r\n\r\nIt would be convenient for developers to be able to create a single tree of traces with all the requests in that journey. \r\n\r\nIn practice, this means that all requests under the journey should share the same `traceID`.\r\n\r\nSome mechanism is needed in order to tell the tracing module when a new root span starts and a new `traceID` is needed.\r\n\r\nAn important nuance about the `traceID` that is generated by the tracing module, is that, in order to work properly with the cloud tracing feature (which makes traces generated by the application under test visible in the test results) this `ID` must follow a concrete format. Therefore, it cannot be supplied by the developer of the test by means of an API, but must be generated by the tracing module.\r\n\r\nAnother important consideration is that the tracing module is not presently generating any span that corresponds to this `traceID`. As a consequence, the tracing backend will report that the \"root span is missing\".  Addressing this issue is outside the scope of this feature but we intend that the proposed solution could also help to address it. \r\n\r\n## Suggested Solution\r\n\r\n### Automatic traceID generation based on the request context\r\n\r\nThe tracing extension keeps track of the context in which each request is executed, including the scenario, iteration, and group. This information is used as metadata and sent to the cloud tracing backend. \r\n\r\nWe propose that the tracing extension generate a different `traceID` for each context and that all requests in the same context use the same `traceID`.\r\n\r\nThe resulting trace tree for the example would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- root span\r\n   |- post\r\n   |- get\r\n   |- get\r\n   |- put\r\n   |- get\r\n   |- post\r\n```\r\nAll requests for the journey are now under the same root span. \r\n\r\n### Alternative: Explicit API for controlling root spans\r\n\r\nInstead of automatically creating a new `traceID` for each context (as described in the previous section), the tracing module could provide an interface for signaling when a new root span starts and a new `TraceID` is needed, following the OTEL specification.\r\n\r\nThe `startTrace()` function generates a new `traceID` to be used for all subsequent requests until the current root span is ended using the `endTrace()` function. \r\n\r\nBy default, a new `traceID` will be used for each request unless the `startTrace` method is called.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction userJourney() {\r\n      // start of journey\r\n      startTrace()\r\n      \r\n      http.post()  // login\r\n      \r\n      // browse catalogue and add to cart\r\n      http.get();\r\n      http.get()\r\n      http.put()\r\n       \r\n      // checkout\r\n      http.get()\r\n      http.post()\r\n    \r\n     // end of journey\r\n     endTrace()\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe main advantage of this option is that it will give control to the developer to define the scope of each trace.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,  it could be extended to cover other requirements, such as creating sub-spans for grouping steps in a test following the OTEL API.\r\n\r\nHowever, this interface is error-prone: starting a new trace in the wrong place (for example, in a sub-function) will break the trace tree.\r\n\r\nAlso, it doesn't add any immediate value when compared with the automatically generated traces unless it is complemented with other features.\r\n\r\n## Related problems not covered by this proposal\r\n\r\n### Generating a root span for each traceID\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, currently the tracing extension is only generating the `traceID` and associating it with a random `parentID`, but no root span is reported to the tracing backend.\r\n\r\nThis proposal does not address this issue. However, there seems not to be any impediment to implement this functionality in the future.\r\n\r\n### Creating sub-spans\r\n\r\nFor complex tests, it would be convenient to allow developers to group requests in sub-spans that represent different steps in the test.\r\n\r\nFor example, group the request for the browse catalog and checkout steps under different sub-spans:\r\n```\r\n- root span\r\n   |- post\r\n   |- sub-span (browse catalog)\r\n   |   |- get\r\n   |   |- get\r\n   |   |- put\r\n   |- sub-span (checkout)\r\n       |- get\r\n       |- post\r\n```\r\nCreating this span tree will require a mechanism to inform the tracing extension of the start/end of a new spam to be used as the parent of the requests.\r\n\r\nImplementing this functionality is outside the scope of this proposal.\r\n\r\n### Already existing or connected issues / PRs (optional)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3029 mentions the ability to export traces, which was removed from the `tracing` module.
