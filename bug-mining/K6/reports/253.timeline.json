clarification and my understanding, what does the target user-experience look like?\r\n\r\nMy assumption reading this is:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// No need to import the `k6/timers` module\r\n\r\nexport default function () {\r\n    setTimeout(...)  // timer functions are available in the runtime \"natively\", like in v8 browser runtimes\r\n    setInterval(...)\r\n    clearTimeout(...)\r\n    clearInterval(...)\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf so, I think that makes a lot of sense, and although I'm not completely set on that, it is also something we might want to consider also for \"Web APIs\" we integrate in the future (webcrypto, streams, fetch (if we do), etc...) to provide a user-experience close to what is available in other runtimes. \r\n\r\n🙇🏻

by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>k6 `v0.50.0` is here 🎉! \n\nThis release:\n- Adds support for uploading files from the browser module.\n- Introduces the `options.cloud` option.\n- Stabilizes the previously experimental timers module as the `k6/timers` module.\n- Brings JSON Web Key support to the `k6/experimental/webcrypto` module.\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n- [websockets#60](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-websockets/pull/60) allows manually setting the `name` tag, which also overwrites the `url` tag with the `name` value. This change makes it consistent with the logic that was implemented in k6 v0.41. Thanks, @mkadirtan for contributing!\n\n### Browser APIs to Async\n\nIn future releases, we are going to be moving most of the synchronous browser APIs to asynchronous ones (promisifying them). We expect this will affect most of our users, so we are posting this upfront before making the change. Here are the reasons for making this large breaking change:\n\n1. Most browser APIs use some form of long-running IO operation (networking) to perform the requested action on the web browser against the website under test. We need to avoid blocking JavaScript's runtime event loop for such operations.\n2. We're going to add more asynchronous event-based APIs (such as [page.on](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/issues/1227)) that our current synchronous APIs would block.\n3. To align with how developers expect to work with JavaScript APIs.\n4. To have better compatibility with Playwright.\n\nYou can find a list of all the APIs that we expect to convert to async in a comment in issue [browser#428](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/issues/428#issuecomment-1964020837).\n\nAwaiting on something that’s not a thenable just returns that value, which means you can add the `await` keyword against APIs that will become async to future proof your test scripts.\n\n## New features\n\n### Add support for uploading files from the browser module [browser#1097](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1097), [browser#1244](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1244)\n\nYou can now upload files using the available input forms on the website under test. The new API is `setInputFiles` which can be called from a `page`, `frame` or `elementHandle` types. It can upload one or more files encoded in the test script. To upload files from the local file system, work with the [experimental fs module](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-experimental/fs/).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Expand to see the examples.</summary>\n\nFor the following examples, we will use the HTML file:\n\n```html\n<html>\n\n<body>\n    <form method=\"POST\" action=\"/upload\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\">\n        <input type=\"file\" name=\"upl\" id=\"upload\" multiple />\n        <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Send\" />\n    </form>\n</body>\n\n</html>\n```\n\nUploading a file can be achieved with the following script:\n\n```js\n// Import the k6 encoder module.\nimport encoding from 'k6/encoding';\n...\nexport default async function () {\n  const page = browser.newPage();\n\n  await page.goto(url)\n\n  // Encode and upload some data into a plain text file called test.txt.\n  page.setInputFiles('input[id=\"upload\"]', { name: 'test.txt', mimetype: 'text/plain', buffer: encoding.b64encode('Hello World') })\n  \n  // Click on the submit button on the form to upload the file.\n  const submitButton = page.locator('input[type=\"submit\"]')\n  await Promise.all([page.waitForNavigation(), submitButton.click()])\n\n  page.close();\n}\n```\n\nUploading multiple files can be done with the use of an array:\n\n```js\npage.setInputFiles('input[id=\"upload\"]',\n    [{ name: 'test.txt', mimetype: 'text/plain', buffer: encoding.b64encode('Hello World') },\n    { name: 'test.json', mimetype: 'text/json', buffer: encoding.b64encode('{\"message\": \"Hello World\"}') }])\n```\n\n</details>\n\nThanks to @bandorko! :bow: :tada:\n\n### Introducing options.cloud [#3348](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3348), [#3407](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3407)\n\nIn this release, we introduce a new way of defining cloud options. From now on, you can use `options.cloud` instead of `options.ext.loadimpact`. \n\nTo migrate, you can move the `loadimpact` object to the root of the `options` object and rename it to `cloud`. For example:\n\n```javascript\nexport let options = {\n    ext: {\n        loadimpact: {\n            name: \"Legacy way of defining cloud options\",\n            projectID: 12345,\n        }\n    }\n};\n\nexport let options = {\n    cloud: {\n        name: \"Current way of defining cloud options\",\n        projectID: 12345,\n    }\n};\n```\n\nAll scripts with legacy `options.ext.loadimpact` will continue to function as before. There's no planned sunset date for the legacy option, but we highly encourage using `options.cloud` going forward. For more details about cloud options, refer to [Cloud options](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/k6/author-run/cloud-scripting-extras/cloud-options/).\n\n### Timers API becomes part of the k6 core [#3587](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3587)\n\nWith this release, the timers API is no longer experimental and can be imported as `k6/timers` instead of as `k6/experimental/timers`. The later will be supported until `v0.52.0`.\n\nYou can also contribute to the discussion on making the current timer exports globally available in [#3589](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3589), or just give it a :+1:.\n\n### JSON Web Key support in `k6/experimental/webcrypto` module [webcrypto#61](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-webcrypto/pull/61)\n\nThe experimental webcrypto module now supports the JSON Web Key (JWK) format, using the `importKey` and `exportKey` methods.\n\nThis allows you to import and export keys in the JWK format for the supported algorithms.\n\n```js\nconst generatedKey = await crypto.subtle.generateKey({name: \"AES-CBC\", length: \"256\"}, true, [ \"encrypt\", \"decrypt\"]);\n\nconst exportedKey = await crypto.subtle.exportKey(\"jwk\", generatedKey);\n```\n\n## UX improvements and enhancements\n\n- [browser#1197](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1197), [browser#1202](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1202), [browser#1203](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1203), [browser#1221](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1221) adds the ability to upload screenshots to a remote location.\n- [browser#1209](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1209) adds a shadow DOM usage example.\n- [browser#1233](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1233) returns actionable errors for `evaluate` APIs.\n- [browser#1228](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1228), [browser#1232](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1232), [browser#1235](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1235) injects the `testRunId` into the `window.k6` object for external applications to query (for example, Grafana Faro).\n\n### Browser Context Isolation [browser#1112](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/issues/1112)\n\nWith this release, we have overhauled and (tremendously) improved the performance and stability of the browser module. It's now possible to run tests with a larger number of VUs concurrently without any performance issues. Previously, when running tests with multiple VUs concurrently, each VU's browser context would attach to the pages from the other VUs' browser contexts. This led to unexpected behavior and performance issues and, to an extent, reduced the module's capability to run multi-VU tests.\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n- [#3653](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3653) fixes a connectivity issue with non-lowercase `options.hosts`.\n- [browser#1215](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1215) fixes a data race during logging that panics.\n- [browser#1238](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1238) fixes fill functionality for textarea. Thanks @bandorko for the fix! :bow: :tada:\n- [browser#1242](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1242) fixes XPath evaluation on `DocumentFragment`.\n\n## Maintenance and internal

by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>k6 `v0.51.0` is here 🎉! Some special mentions included in this release:\r\n\r\n- [A new experimental streams module](#introduction-of-k6experimentalstreams-module-3696)\r\n- [New algorithms for WebCrypto module](#new-features-and-updates-of-webcrypto-api-support-3714)\r\n- [Timers are globally available](#timers-globally-available-3589)\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n### Transition browser APIs to Async\r\n\r\nIn the last release notes [we mentioned](https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/master/release%20notes/v0.50.0.md#browser-apis-to-async) this breaking change, and we wanted to remind and update you on the plan. In the **next** release (v0.52.0), most of the synchronous browser APIs will be migrated to be asynchronous (promisifying them). We expect this will affect most if not all of our users.\r\n\r\nThis breaking change will require you to add `await` in front of most of the browser module APIs. Without this `await` you will witness undocumented and unknown behavior during the runtime. To make the migration simpler we advise that you work with the latest [k6 type definitions](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/set-up/configure-k6-intellisense/).\r\n\r\nYou can find a list of all the APIs that we expect to convert to async in a comment in issue [browser#428](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/issues/428#issuecomment-1964020837).\r\n\r\nAwaiting on something that’s not a thenable just returns that value, which means you can add the `await` keyword today on the APIs that will become async to future proof your test scripts.\r\n\r\nHere are the reasons for making this large breaking change:\r\n\r\n1. Most browser APIs use some form of long-running IO operation (networking) to perform the requested action on the web browser against the website under test. We need to avoid blocking JavaScript's runtime event loop for such operations.\r\n2. We're going to add more asynchronous event-based APIs (such as [page.on](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/issues/1227)) that our current synchronous APIs would block.\r\n3. To align with how developers expect to work with JavaScript APIs.\r\n4. To have better compatibility with Playwright.\r\n\r\nAs a starting point, we have migrated a single API (the `tap` method), which you can find the details below that will help visualize the upcoming breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### Browser `Tap` is now an async method grafana/xk6-browser#1268\r\n\r\nThis release converts the `Tap` method in the `browser` module into an asynchronous method. This change is necessary to ensure that the method can be used in async contexts and to align with the rest of the browser module's planned asynchronous API. To use the `Tap` method, you must now add the `await` keyword before the method call.\r\n\r\nAffected components:\r\n- [`locator.tap`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-experimental/browser/locator/tap/)\r\n- [`page.tap`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-experimental/browser/page/tap/)\r\n- [`frame.tap`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-experimental/browser/frame/tap)\r\n- [`elementHandle.tap`](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-experimental/browser/elementhandle/tap)\r\n\r\nSee the following example for how to use the `Tap` method after this change:\r\n\r\n**Before**:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport browser from 'k6/experimental/browser'\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nexport default function () {\r\n\t// ...\r\n\tpage.tap(selector, { modifiers: [\"Alt\", \"Control\", \"Meta\", \"Shift\"] });\r\n\t// ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport browser from 'k6/experimental/browser'\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nexport default function () {\r\n\t// ...\r\n\tawait page.tap(selector, { modifiers: [\"Alt\", \"Control\", \"Meta\", \"Shift\"] });\r\n\t// ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `k6/experimental/websockets` will not default `binaryType` to `\"arraybuffer\"'\r\n\r\nAs part of the stabilization of the API it needs to become as close to the specification.\r\n\r\nEarly in the development the idea of adding `Blob` support as part was deemed feature creep and was dropped in favor of going with only `\"arraybuffer\"`. But the specification defaults to returning binary responses as `Blob` - which was another thing that was changed.\r\n\r\nWhile adding `Blob` is still on our radar, moving the default is always going to be a breaking change that we need to do to align with the specification.\r\n\r\nFor this release there is now a warning that will be printed if `binaryType` is not set to `\"arraybuffer\"` *and* a binary response is received. The warning will go away when `binaryType` is set to `\"arraybuffer\"`.\r\n\r\nIn the next release the warning will become an error.\r\n\r\nMore info and place for discussion can be found in an [this issue](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-websockets/issues/67).\r\n\r\n### `k6/experimental/grpc` is no longer available [#3530](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3530)\r\n\r\nAs the last step of the graduation process for the experimental gRPC module, we completely removed the module. It is now fully integrated into the stable `k6/net/grpc` module. So, if you haven't done this yet, replace your imports from `k6/experimental/grpc` to `k6/net/grpc`.\r\n\r\n### Deprecations\r\n\r\nThe following pull requests start the process to introduce breaking changes. They are currently starting to emit warning if their condition is hit, but they will turn to return errors in the future release.\r\nIt is recommended to use the suggested alternative, or to fix the script if you see the warning message.\r\n\r\n- [#3681](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3681) Use of not-compliant `require` expressions.\r\n- [#3680](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3680) Modules resolution of modules not previously seen during the initialization phase.\r\n- [#3676](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3676) Working directory is set to the current location when the script is provided using stdin, instead of the root folder.\r\n- [#3530](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3671) Automagically resolve modules from cdnjs and github \"URLs\".\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n### Introduction of `k6/experimental/streams` module [#3696](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3696)\r\n\r\nThis release of k6 introduces the new `k6/experimental/streams` module, which partially supports the JavaScript\r\nStreams API, focusing initially on the `ReadableStream` construct.\r\n\r\nWith the `ReadableStream`, users can define and consume data streams within k6 scripts. This is particularly useful for\r\nefficiently handling large datasets or for processing data sequentially in a controlled flow.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary> Expand to see an example of stream's usage</summary>\r\n\r\nThe following example demonstrates creating and consuming a simple stream that emits numbers until it reaches a predefined limit:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { ReadableStream } from 'k6/experimental/streams'\r\n\r\nfunction numbersStream() {\r\n    let currentNumber = 0\r\n\r\n\treturn new ReadableStream({\r\n\t\tstart(controller) {\r\n\t\t\tconst fn = () => {\r\n\t\t\t\tif (currentNumber < 5) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcontroller.enqueue(++currentNumber)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tsetTimeout(fn, 1000)\r\n\t\t\t\t\treturn;\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tcontroller.close()\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tsetTimeout(fn, 1000)\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t})\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default async function () {\r\n\tconst stream = numbersStream()\r\n\tconst reader = stream.getReader()\r\n\r\n\twhile (true) {\r\n\t\tconst { done, value } = await reader.read()\r\n\t\tif (done) break\r\n\t\tconsole.log(`received number ${value} from stream`)\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tconsole.log('we are done')\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nFor more advanced examples, please head to the MDN Web Docs on the [Streams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API).\r\n\r\n#### Limitations\r\n\r\nCurrently, users can define and consume readable streams. However, this release does not include support for byte readers\r\nand controllers, nor does it include support the `tee`, `pipeTo`, and\r\n`pipeThrough` methods of the `ReadableStream` object.\r\n\r\n### New features and updates of WebCrypto API support [#3714](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3714)\r\n\r\nThis release brings support for asymmetric cryptography to the `k6/experimental/webcrypto` module. We added support of the elliptic curves algorithms ECDH ([xk6-webcrypto#67](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-webcrypto/pull/67)) and ECDSA ([xk6-webcrypto#69](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-webcrypto/pull/69)) algorithms along with new import/export key formats like `spki` and `pkcs8`.\r\n\r\nOne of the newly added operations is `deriveBits`, which allows parties to generate a unique shared secret by using shared public and non-shared private keys.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary> Expand to see an example of generating a shared secret for Alice and Bob.</summary>\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { crypto } from 'k6/experimental/webcrypto';\r\n\r\nexport default async function () {\r\n  // Generate a key pair for Alice\r\n  const aliceKeyPair = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'ECDH',\r\n      namedCurve: 'P-256',\r\n    },\r\n    true,\r\n    ['deriveKey', 'deriveBits']\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  // Generate a key pair for Bob\r\n  const bobKeyPair = await crypto.subtle.generateKey(\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'ECDH',\r\n      namedCurve: 'P-256',\r\n    },\r\n    true,\r\n    ['deriveKey', 'deriveBits']\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  // Derive shared secret for Alice\r\n  const aliceSharedSecret = await deriveSharedSecret(aliceKeyPair.privateKey, bobKeyPair.publicKey);\r\n\r\n  // Derive shared secret for Bob\r\n  const bobSharedSecret = await deriveSharedSecret(bobKeyPair.privateKey, aliceKeyPair.publicKey);\r\n\r\n  // alice shared secret and bob shared secret should be the same\r\n  console.log('alice shared secret: ' + printArrayBuffer(aliceSharedSecret));\r\n  console.log('bob shared secret: ' + printArrayBuffer(bobSharedSecret));\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync function deriveSharedSecret(privateKey, publicKey) {\r\n  return crypto.subtle.deriveBits(\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'ECDH',\r\n      public: publicKey,\r\n    },\r\n    privateKey,\r\n    256\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst printArrayBuffer = (buffer) => {\r\n  const view = new Uint8Array(buffer);\r\n  return Array.from(view);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nThe `sign` and `verify` operations got support for ECDSA algorithm. The `sign` operation allows you to sign a message with a private key, while the `verify` operation allows you to verify the signature with a public key.\r\n\r\nOther notable updates and fixes:\r\n\r\n- [xk6-webcrypto#68](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-webcrypto/pull/68) fixes a degradation for the sign/verify operations for HMAC algorithm.\r\n- [xk6-webcrypto#75](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-webcrypto/pull/75), [xk6-webcrypto#76](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-webcrypto/pull/76) refactor webcrypto module to be thread-safe.\r\n- [xk6-webcrypto#74](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-webcrypto/pull/74) adds JWK import/export support for ECDH and ECDSA. Refactors JWK import/export to use only go standard library.\r\n\r\nSee [webcrypto's module documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-experimental/webcrypto/) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Timers globally available [#3589](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3589)\r\n\r\n`setTimeout`, `setInterval` and related clear functions have been part of the JavaScript ecosystem, probably for as long as it has existed.\r\n\r\nIn the previous releases we stabilized and made them available through `k6/timers` module. While the module isn't going anywhere and might get more identifiers, `setTimeout` is usually used without importing it. For this reason it is now globally available along `clearTimeout`, `setInterval` and `clearInterval`.\r\n\r\nNo code needs to be changed, but you no longer need to import `k6/timers` to use this functionality.\r\n\r\n## UX improvements and enhancements\r\n\r\n- [#3670](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3670) adds the ability to [enable profiling](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/k6-options/reference/#profiling-enabled) via environment variable. Thanks @Bablzz for your contribution!\r\n- [#3655](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3655) clarifies the error message for the validation of scenario's name.\r\n- [#3693](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3693) adds a gRPC client's `asyncInvoke` method to the `k6/net/grpc` module. It's [a non-blocking version](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-net-grpc/client/client-async-invoke/) of the `invoke` method.\r\n- [browser#1259](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1259), [browser#1260](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1260) adds errors to the traces that the browser module generates.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- [#3708](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3708) denies access to `execution.test.options` from Init context.\r\n- [#3672](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3672) picks the correct value when [SystemTags](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/using-k6/k6-options/reference/#system-tags) are set via the `k6_SYSTEM_TAGS` environment variable.\r\n- [#3657](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3657) fixes a panic when `mappings` field is empty in the provided SourceMap.\r\n- [#3717](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3717) returns a correct line number when an inlined SourceMap is used.\r\n- [browser#1261](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1261) fixes dispose context canceled errors.\r\n- [browser#1254](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1254) fixes an indefinite wait when testing websites with iframes.\r\n- [browser#1291](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1291) fixes a panic on dispose of resources during a navigation.\r\n\r\n## Maintenance and internal improvements\r\n\r\n- [#3663](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3663), [#3673](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3673) updates several dependencies.\r\n- [#3674](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3674) updates the Go version, now k6 binary is built and tested using Go 1.22.\r\n- [#3688](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/3688) updates the link to installation instructions for `golangci-lint` in the contribution guide. Thanks @yomek33 for your contribution!\r\n- [browser#1262](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1262) fixes a flaky test.\r\n- [browser#1264](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-browser/pull/1264) removes unimplemented APIs.\r\n\r\n## Future plans\r\n\r\n### Use Blob as default value for WebSocket.binaryType \r\n\r\nAs the changes in documentation mention, [`binaryType`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket/binaryType) was by default set to `arraybuffer`, now instead it is `\"\"` (empty string).\r\nIn a not so remote future, instead, we expect to introduce and use Blob object.\r\n\r\n### WebCrypto graduation\r\n\r\nWebCrypto got more features in the current release, and we expect to continue its expansion in the next iterations. Reaching a wider coverage will push WebCrypto module to being graduated as a stable module.\r\n\r\n### Streams API\r\n\r\nIn the not so distant future, we have plans to start using the Streams API in existing modules. Our first iteration being adding a `.readable` property to the already existing [fs.File](https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/javascript-api/k6-experimental/fs/file) object.\r\n\r\n### Improve user experience for Cloud related commands\r\n\r\nIn the near future, we intend to reiterate on `k6 cloud` and related commands to create a simplified and more ergonomic user experience.\r\n\r\n### Remove experimental timers module\r\n\r\nThe `k6/experimental/timers` module is now part of the stable k6 API as `k6/timers` and via the globally available functions. The next release will make the experimental import no longer available.\r\n</pre>\n</details>\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/171570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/171570/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-26T10:07:23Z","updated_at":"2024-06-26T10:07:23Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/3814","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/3814/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/3814/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/3814/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/3814","id":2374919183,"node_id":"I_kwDOAz4Wr86NjmQP","number":3814,"title":"Fix
