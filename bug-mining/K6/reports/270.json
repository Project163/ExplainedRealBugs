Unfortuantely it isn't in the path by default and the path to the exact location is dependant on the version of the windows kit.\n\nhttps://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/ba6a71ea63aca6b2976a34631c5b26d3c52272a5/.github/workflows/build.yml#L246-L247\n\nMoving from windows-2019 to windows-2022 github action image meant that the path chagned and we had to fix it.\n\nGiven the information I found there doesn't seem to be a fix for this. If we ran from the terminal inside visual studio that sets the path correctly ... which doesn't seem like a good thing for a CI ;). \n\nLuckily there aren't that many windows releases so hopefully we need to fix this once every 3-4 years, but it will still be nice if it isn't as brittle as it is.","closed_by":{"login":"codebien","id":2103732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDM3MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2103732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien","html_url":"https://github.com/codebien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/4105/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/4105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
