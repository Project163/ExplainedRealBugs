Ah, so the error is that the test name is empty when reading from stdin and that fails the validation in the ingest API.

I think k6 should set the default name to \"<stdin>\" or something similar (maybe add a timestamp if we feel that all stdin based tests shouldn't be grouped together). I think the validation of the name in the ingest API is good, and if k6 knows the script comes from stdin why not use that to help the user with identifying that in the cloud service?
