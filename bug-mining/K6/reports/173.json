the [`ramping-arrival-rate` executor](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/scenarios/executors/ramping-arrival-rate) spawns a new goroutine for every iteration it has to make: https://github.com/k6io/k6/blob/abce5d835c294c77e4a1a880d73171bf6be62d96/lib/executor/ramping_arrival_rate.go#L445\r\n\r\nThis is in contrast to most of our other executors, which usually spin up a single goroutine per VU and execute iterations inside of it, for example `shared-iterations`: https://github.com/k6io/k6/blob/abce5d835c294c77e4a1a880d73171bf6be62d96/lib/executor/shared_iterations.go#L274\r\n\r\nWe have noticed some performance issues with the `ramping-arrival-rate` executor and we _think_ this excessive goroutine spawning is a big part of the problem: https://github.com/k6io/k6/issues/1386#issuecomment-780704639\r\n\r\nSo, we'd like to have a [benchmark](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Benchmarks) for the `ramping-arrival-rate` executor, measuring how it currently behaves with different combinations of `preAllocatedVUs` and `rate` options, and also want to to rewrite the executor to spawn just a single goroutine per VU and see if that makes a substantial performance difference.","closed_by":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1944/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1944/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
