have the following k6 script:\r\n```js\r\nimport { sleep } from \"k6\";\r\n\r\nconst sleepTime = parseFloat(__ENV.sleep);\r\n\r\nexport function setup() {\r\n    sleep(sleepTime);\r\n    console.log(\"setup successful\");\r\n    return \"setup successful\";\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default function (data) {\r\n    console.log(\"default with setup \" + JSON.stringify(data));\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function teardown() {\r\n    sleep(sleepTime);\r\n    console.log(\"teardown successful\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I execute it with `k6 run -e sleep=11 xt.js` (the default timeouts for the `setup()` and `teardown()` functions is 10 seconds), I consistently get the expected `Engine error` with a message `setup: context cancelled at setup (...)`. Despite not changing the k6 exit code ([link to issue about it](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/868)) and the very poor error message (sigh), the timeout works consistently and aborts the script correctly. \r\n\r\nWhen I run the script with `k6 run -e sleep=11 --no-setup --no-teardown --paused xt.js` on the other hand, and I trigger the setup execution via the k6 REST API with `curl -i -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:6565/v1/setup`, some of the time I correctly get `HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error` with body `{\"errors\":[{\"status\":\"500\",\"title\":\"Error executing setup\",\"detail\":\"setup: context cancelled at setup (...)\"}]}`, but most of the time k6 actually ignores the timeout and I get `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` with a body `{\"data\":{\"type\":\"setupData\",\"id\":\"default\",\"attributes\":{\"data\":\"setup successful\"}}}`\r\n\r\nIncreasing the sleep time to 21 (`k6 run -e sleep=21 --no-setup --no-teardown --paused xt.js` for example) seems to somewhat ameliorate the issue, in that there are fewer `200` responses, but it still doesn't completely fix it! Splitting the `sleep()` call in the `setup()` function to `sleep(sleepTime/2); sleep(sleepTime/2);` on the other hand causes the issue to disappear completely, at least as far as I can test. So this seems to be some sort of channel select issue where the timeouts don't always register?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/869/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/447372935","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/868#issuecomment-447372935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/868","id":447372935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NzM3MjkzNQ==","user":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-14T16:14:23Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T16:14:23Z","body":"Just
