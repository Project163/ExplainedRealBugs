Especially as that PR also let users actually prepend `https://` infront of modules specifiers which made them more consistent and obvious. \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nGiven that it has been 4 years - I am for dropping this functionality. I very much doubt anyone still uses that, and if they do they have been seeing the message all of this time.\r\n\r\nWe can also change the message to us actually deprecating it one release and removing it a few releases later, to be more consistent and to not break someone script. Although again I really doubt anyone has been using this with this message constantly logging.","closed_by":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/3287/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/3287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
