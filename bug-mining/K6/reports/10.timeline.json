are currently allocated as an atomic counter - the first group() statement executed allocates ID 1, the next one ID 2, and so on. The problem with this appears when running the following script in a distributed setting:\r\n\r\n```es6\r\nif (Math.random() < 0.5) {\r\n    group(\"group 1\", function() { /* ... */ });\r\n} else {\r\n    group(\"group 2\", function() { /* ... */ });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen run distributed, roughly 50% of instances will give ID 1 to group 1, and the other 50% to group 2, which means group-tagged data when consolidated will create incorrect, potentially misleading results results.\r\n\r\nWhile this example is contrived for illustration's sake, it's not unthinkable that a similar problem may occur with a deeply nested group in a sufficiently complex test, at which point it would be very difficult to detect.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo, my idea for this is some kind of hash. Given the following structure:\r\n\r\n- **group 1**\r\n  - check 1\r\n  - check 2\r\n- **group 2**\r\n  - check 1\r\n  - check 2\r\n  - **group 2.1**\r\n    - check 1\r\n    - check 2\r\n\r\nThe IDs would be some form of hash of:\r\n\r\n- **`::group 1`**\r\n  - `::group 1=>check 1`\r\n  - `::group 1=>check 2`\r\n- **`::group 2`**\r\n  - `::group 2=>check 1`\r\n  - `::group 2=>check 2`\r\n  - **`::group 2::group 2.1`**\r\n    - `::group 2::group 2.1=>check 1`\r\n    - `::group 2::group 2.1=>check 2`\r\n\r\nThe reason I mention UUIDs is that [algorithms 3 and 5 are non-random identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Versions_3_and_5_.28namespace_name-based.29), it's a standard format, fairly easily readable and with implementations everywhere.\r\n\r\nThat said, literally any form of concise, fixed-length hashes work.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/272520286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":939023087,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTM5MDIzMDg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/939023087","actor":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"116b3d6144da8e36169bdfb2af931c5b2584095a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/commits/116b3d6144da8e36169bdfb2af931c5b2584095a","created_at":"2017-01-27T09:30:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15960587933,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAz4Wr84LwECPzwAAAAO3Uz6d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/15960587933","actor":{"login":"olegbespalov","id":5425600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MjU2MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5425600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegbespalov","html_url":"https://github.com/olegbespalov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegbespalov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegbespalov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegbespalov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegbespalov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegbespalov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegbespalov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegbespalov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegbespalov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olegbespalov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ae80034d38f733f8f2d78ade465b9aef8368de89","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/commits/ae80034d38f733f8f2d78ade465b9aef8368de89","created_at":"2025-01-16T13:22:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16081227684,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAz4Wr84LwECPzwAAAAO-hA-k","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/16081227684","actor":{"login":"codebien","id":2103732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDM3MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2103732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien","html_url":"https://github.com/codebien","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codebien/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"
