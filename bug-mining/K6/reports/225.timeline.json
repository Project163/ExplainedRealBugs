should fix https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/469 and simplify https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/553\r\n\r\nI investigated the `lib.Collector` interface and its various implementations and I think that the current assumption in the dummy stat collector that `Collect()` should only be called after `Run()` is wrong. The purpose of `Run()` is to periodically, in batches, send the collected samples to some upstream collector. It would be concurrently run with all of the calls to `Collect()` (which themselves should only be sequential), but I don't see a reason why it must be started before `Collect()` is ever called.\r\n\r\nAlso, the current synchronization in the dummy collector actually prevented something important from being tested. `Collect()` should never be called concurrently, and with the current locking, we probably wouldn't have known if that was actually the case. This pull request removes any locking from `Collect()` so that when [this](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/536) is fixed and we enable automatic testing with `-race`, Go's race condition detector can actually detect incorrect usage of the collector.\r\n\r\nThat's also one of the reasons that I gave up on the idea of using a channel instead a `[]stat.Sample` slice that I discussed with @antekresic in https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/553. The other reason is that go doesn't have channels with infinite buffers and it would be inconvenient to specify exact buffer sizes in a lot of tests, for example [this one](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/fa5731484a9d8bbfe10a4af569dfe8978133ffd9/core/engine_test.go#L493). In the end it's also not really necessary and sample slices are simpler than channels.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/561/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/561/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1540588167,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQxNTQwNTg4MTY3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/1540588167","actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-26T11:07:14Z","assignee":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/376151737","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/536#issuecomment-376151737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/536","id":376151737,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjE1MTczNw==","user":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-26T12:40:49Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T12:42:17Z","body":"The metrics collection race condition is because we use [`httptrace.ClientTrace`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httptrace/#ClientTrace) incorrectly. From the docs:\r\n>  Functions may be called concurrently from different goroutines and some may be called after the request has completed or failed.\r\n\r\nRegarding `ClientTrace.ConnectStart` and `ClientTrace.ConnectDone` specifically:\r\n> If net.Dialer.DualStack (IPv6 \"Happy Eyeballs\") support is this may be called multiple times.\r\n\r\nAnd `ClientTrace.WroteRequest`:\r\n> It may be called multiple times in the case of retried requests.\r\n\r\n[The k6 code](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/978004df8aee8704768f08faecd6738467820bd5/lib/netext/tracer.go#L168-L213) that uses `ClientTrace` has a lot of reads and writes for the same variables without any synchronization, so it has to be refactored. I'm not sure that a bunch of mutexes is the correct approach here, something event-based seems like a better solution, for example each of the `ClientTrace` methods could just create an event, send it over a channel and something else can synchronously and safely process them.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/376151737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-29T11:51:11Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T11:51:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/564","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/564/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/564/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/564/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/564","id":309724608,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTc4MzA1NjM2","number":564,"title":"Data
