The new request body is corrupted.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nresponse = http.get('http://localhost/binary');\r\nhttp.post('http://localhost/compare', response.body);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example the `compare` endpoint won't receive the same binary data as was returned by the `binary` endpoint. I've created a sample Go http server that serves files and has a `compare` endpoint. The readme shows the validation of the Go server along with the Python SimpleHTTPServer. \r\n\r\nThe k6 file also reads a binary file from disk and demonstrates that works against the `compare` endpoint.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/sherrman/k6_binarybug\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/748/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
