If a test goes awry, i'd like to be able to terminate it as quickly as possible and shutting down the instance can sometimes take several seconds/minutes.  The HTTP API is great for pausing/resuming tests quickly - it would be nice and tidy if i could also abort a test in the same way (which in my case leads to the output being saved and the instance terminated).\r\n\r\n## Suggested Solution (optional)\r\nI see the various `context`s in play, but no easy path to cancel the parent created in the run cmd from the http API.  The existing OS interrupt/term signal handling is graceful enough, but forcing a signal back into the process from the API feels wrong, and (i think) lacks some support on Windows.\r\n\r\nWould simply adding a bool to the Engine struct and testing for it at the end of the `select` in Engine.Run() (https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/new-schedulers/core/engine.go#L222) be an option you'd consider?\r\n\r\nIf so, any suggestions for the HTTP route (ie; adding to the `/status` PATCH, or a new route/different verb?)","closed_by":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1352/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1352/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
