Or, we can outright \"buy trust\" with an EV certificate, which the current one that Robin provided is not. These are usually much more expensive than regular certs and it's a plain scam if you ask me, but perhaps it might be worth it as a shortcut to get rid of this warning.\r\n\r\n@robingustafsson @na--

things up.\r\n\r\nGiven this, I'm inclined to suggest that we start using this non-EV cert from v0.30.0 and just wait for MS to trust it.

#1034\r\n\r\nI tested this in my fork and you can download the signed MSI from [here](https://github.com/imiric/k6/actions/runs/385130865). As explained in [this comment](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1034#issuecomment-734268724), I chose to not use any 3rd-party extensions to avoid any security issues. As noted there, this won't remove the \"Windows protected your PC\" warning, but should eventually if we reach a certain \"trust\" level with Microsoft, which is gained by a lot of people choosing to run the app anyway.\r\n\r\nTwo secrets were added to the GitHub repo for this: `WIN_SIGN_CERT` and `WIN_SIGN_PASS`. Information about both can be found in the password manager.\r\n\r\nNote that currently this only signs the binary in the MSI package and the MSI itself that are uploaded to Bintray. The binary that is uploaded to GitHub and available as release assets is not signed, as that would be more convoluted to setup, since `signtool.exe` is Windows-only and the build stage happens on Linux. I suppose we could overwrite the assets from Windows, but I didn't test this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1746/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4055997971,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDA1NTk5Nzk3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/4055997971","actor":{"login":"imiric","id":1009277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDkyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1009277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric","html_url":"https://github.com/imiric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-01T09:14:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4055998083,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQwNTU5OTgwODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/4055998083","actor":{"login":"imiric","id":1009277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDkyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1009277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric","html_url":"https://github.com/imiric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7d3809a6db7ccb556fa722a346b72392eeb20bea","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/commits/7d3809a6db7ccb556fa722a346b72392eeb20bea","created_at":"2020-12-01T09:14:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4056014080,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQwNTYwMTQwODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/4056014080","actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-01T09:18:13Z","milestone":{"title":"v0.30.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"imiric","id":1009277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDkyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1009277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric","html_url":"https://github.com/imiric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-11T10:17:57Z","updat
