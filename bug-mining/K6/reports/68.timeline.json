#248\r\n\r\nI still working on this, I am testing different HAR exportation tools and some scenarios more. The objective of this PR is to validate if I'm on the right track and the code meets the requirements. I would be grateful to receive guidelines on what things I need to add, change or remove.\r\n\r\nThe HAR struct is based from google/martian one but I have added some missing fields like Log.Browser, Log.Pages, Log.Comment, etc\r\n\r\nThere are some helper functions to build the k6 script parts (BuildK6Request, BuildK6RequestObject, BuildK6HeadersValues, BuildK6CookiesValues..), they use directly HAR objects (ex: Har.Header) as parameters to avoid extra load but if you need support to convert any other formats to a k6 script these helper functions can be easily converted to a generic ones.\r\n\r\nThe HAR entries (HTTP requests) are ordered as the specification recommends (http://w3c.github.io/web-performance/specs/HAR/Overview.html#sec-object-types-entries), although all tested HAR entries from exported files are already ordered.\r\n\r\nI have detected that configured firewall/antimalware/adblockers block some requests and these exported HAR entries/requests have empty responses, they are ignored for status code checks.\r\n\r\nBy default the requests are grouped by page and batched in 500ms (what do you think?) intervals by their started time (you can change this value with --batch-inclusion-threshold 200). For batch requests I define a []req object with all k6 requests objects and this object is passed to the http.batch call.\r\n\r\nI like the http.request and http.<verb> calls, you can disable batch mode using --batch-inclusion-threshold 0 (maybe it isn't the best way) and the convert command creates a k6 script with these request types instead of the http.batch ones. Batch mode can be the preferred mode for HAR files but this option can be interesting for debugging. Should I keep this functionality/mode (no batch mode)?\r\n\r\nThe --only <text> and --skip <text> options filters HAR requests, these flags checks if the URL.Host contains the given string so you can do things like --only https:// or --skip :8080 besides --only domain.com,cdn.domain.com (they works like \"OR\" conditions, domain.com or cdn.domain.com)\r\n\r\nTODO/Issues:\r\n- Complete TestBuildK6Request and TestBuildK6RequestObject tests cases\r\n- Improve command description/help\r\n- Add example HAR files to samples/har folder, include them in tests\r\n\r\n- The SPDY's colon headers (ex: \":Host\") are not valid header requests (https://github.com/golang/net/blob/master/lex/httplex/httplex.go#L201), so BuildK6Headers ignores them.\r\n\r\n- The Firefox (54.0.1) exported HAR file from a multipart post request (example: uploading a file) includes the file content in binary mode. How can I build a k6 request body from that content? I mean the ideal way is this content was base64 encoded, should I parse/modify the boundary to a base64 one? (boundaries with content-transfer-encoding != base64 only. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6.1 https://golang.org/pkg/mime/multipart/#example_NewReader). FiddlerToLoadImpact tool (https://github.com/loadimpact/FiddlerToLoadImpact) creates external binary files, they are included to the k6 scripts with bin1 = open(\"bin1.bin\").\r\nWhat if you support base64 encoded body string parameter for the k6 http requests (I mean something like http.post(url, base64EncodedFormData, { base64: true });)? It's simpler just encode body requests parameter with no printable/binary content.\r\nThe file content is missing in the HAR exportation from Chrome 59.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/291/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/323778075","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/296#issuecomment-323778075","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/296","id":323778075,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzc3ODA3NQ==","user":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-21T15:38:03Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T15:38:03Z","body":"There should definitely be a limit to how many requests are executed in parallel.
