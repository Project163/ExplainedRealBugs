`fallthrough` (or rewriting the switch to a simple `if strings.ToLower(key) == \"host\"` and always setting the header value) would be enough to fix it, but whoever ends up doing that should read up on the Go `net/http` docs and maybe the RFC, as well as test things thoroughly, so we don't mess up something
