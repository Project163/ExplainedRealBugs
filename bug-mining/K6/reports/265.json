I suspect the decision to show stats is done by just looking at a single VU, and how many HTTP requests it has generated?\r\n\r\nI.e. if I have a script that looks like this:\r\n```\r\nimport http from \"k6/http\";\r\nimport { group, sleep, check } from \"k6\";\r\nexport default function() {\r\n  http.get(\"...some-URL...\");\r\n  sleep(5.0);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then run it for 5 seconds with 10 VUs: `k6 run --vus 10 --duration 5s script.js`\r\n\r\nIt will make 10 HTTP requests, but I get no HTTP stats at the end of the test run.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/79/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/79/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
