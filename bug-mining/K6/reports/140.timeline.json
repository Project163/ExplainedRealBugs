Getting on this right now, just a quick question: should we enforce valid hostname patterns, or should that be left to the user? Also, should blacklisted hosts throw the same error code as blacklisted IPs, or use a new

I don't think you _can_ enforce valid hostname patterns, if you go with the approach suggested in https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/972#issuecomment-500879650. I'd be tricky when you have `--blacklist-hostname \"/[\\w]+\\.example\\.com/\"\"` to say for sure if it always matches a valid domain.\r\n\r\nThat said, I just realized that implementing this with regexes will probably incur some potentially serious performance issues for large lists, similar to the issues of the current naive implementation of IP blocking (https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1256). If we allow regexes, I can't think of an easy implementation approach that is not just iterating over the list of blacklisted hostnames and checking against each... At that point we might as well extend this and call it \"blacklisted URLs\" and allow blocking by any part of the URL...\r\n\r\nWhereas if we allow only plain hostnames and leaf `*` wildcards, there's a somewhat easy way to efficiently implement it, by reversing the domains and constructing a map (flat or nested) or a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie), so that the lookup will be much faster... This only makes sense if we expect to have large blacklists often though. For a few items, iterating over them will probably be faster...\r\n\r\nAnd we might also want to use a different option name than `--blacklist-hostname`... While I don't think the [etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklisting#Origins_of_the_term) of the word is problematic (see also [this](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/)), in the context of k6, `--block-hostname`, `--skip-hostname` and `--ignore-hostname` are more than viable alternatives. Personally, I think I prefer `--ignore-hostname`, since it conveys the intention behind the option even more clearly to me...\r\n\r\nIn short, sorry for the delay @krashanoff, but I think there's some further evaluation of this issue needed, before you can start implementing it. cc @robingustafsson @MStoykov @imiric, what are your thoughts about :arrow_up:
