This should be clarified in the docs, so thanks for bringing it to our attention. All it says now regarding the \"init\" vs \"VU\" code is here: https://docs.k6.io/docs/running-k6#section-adding-more-vus\r\n\r\nI believe your use case would be solved by https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/194. Until that is implemented I'd suggest a workaround like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nlet organization_ids = null;\r\nexport default function() {\r\n    // Get organization IDs on first iteration of each VU\r\n    if (__ITER === 0) {\r\n        organization_ids = get_organizations_id();\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `__ITER` global variable contains a zero-based number representing the current VU's iteration count. Can be used in combination with `__VU` (current VU number, one-based) to do even more specific initialization.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/317698983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"robingustafsson","id":1792533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTI1MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1792533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson","html_url":"https://github.com/robingustafsson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robingustafsson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1177741490,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTE3Nzc0MTQ5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/1177741490","actor":{"login":"rafaelcapucho","id":163367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelcapucho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-25T10:38:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1177741491,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDExNzc3NDE0OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/1177741491","actor":{"login":"rafaelcapucho","id":163367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzM2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelcapucho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelcapucho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-25T10:38:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/319214896","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/284#issuecomment-319214896","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/284","id":319214896,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTIxNDg5Ng==","user":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User",
