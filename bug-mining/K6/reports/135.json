After some additional logs, it is easy to spot \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/312246/83159157-5cfe3880-a10e-11ea-9a92-1839f9a3da6b.png)\r\nAs is seen `rawStep` goes a little faster sometimes and gets 2-3 steps ahead of `gracefulLimit` and when we get a `gracefulLimit` that is basically for some steps ago and we stop a VU or two... gracefully :D. \r\n\r\nThis (at least for me) only happens if the machine is under load which is not all that hard especially when ramping up so ...\r\nThe code in question reads from two different channels that get events every time something needs to happen.\r\nhttps://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/83d0fcf2ecf44db27275cdf7ea887c05edf9bd06/lib/executor/variable_looping_vus.go#L638-L673\r\nI do think it will be much simpler and easier if we zip (combine) the two giving `gracefulLimit` the preference and just go through the new slice ... \r\n\r\nThis also will definitely be more performant, not that 2 goroutines and 2 channels are too much ... but we can skip them :D \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
