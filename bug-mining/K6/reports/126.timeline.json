k6 has only a few exit codes we specifically set - `98` and `99`:\r\n- `k6 run` with a failed threshold will return `99` ([code](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/b154f449b8c4a67929f36cba07f58a218acd99e9/cmd/run.go#L432))\r\n- `k6 cloud` will fail with `98` if it couldn't get the test progress for some reason (I think) like network failure and with `99` if the test run itself failed ([code](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/b154f449b8c4a67929f36cba07f58a218acd99e9/cmd/cloud.go#L193-L201))\r\n\r\n`k6` will otherwise exit with 0 if there were no errors or with `255` for anything else that fails in a controlled manner, i.e. anything that's not a panic or OOM ([code](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/b154f449b8c4a67929f36cba07f58a218acd99e9/cmd/root.go#L92)). \r\n\r\n_(Go panics could also make k6 exit with a few different exit codes, though we've hopefully mostly eliminated them in k6, [this](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/867) is the only one we've recently seen. Skimming [this file](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/runtime/panic.go), it seems like most of the time `exit(2)` should be called, but technically it's also possible to have `exit(4)` and `exit(5)` when panicking, even if unlikely...)_\r\n\r\nThis issue is a proposition that different types of errors should cause k6 to exit with different error codes. We should reserve a range and define, document and distinguish between errors - config validation errors, script errors in the init phase, script errors in the setup or teardown phases, crossed script errors threshold (will write another issue about that), etc. When we've defined a range for k6 system exit codes, we can also define a range for user error codes and allow users to specify them in the thresholds configurations, as requested in [this issue](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/680).\r\n\r\nThese enhancements could be very useful when using k6 in a CI environment.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/870/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/870/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-15T12:54:00Z","updated_at":"2019-05-15T12:54:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1007","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1007/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1007/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1007/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/1007","id":436239763,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjcyNzcyNjYx","number":1007,"title":"New

pull request totally rewrites the old local executor and a bunch of other things. It builds on https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/913 and introduces quite a lot of new functionality, but it also has some minor breaking changes.\r\n\r\n### New features and changes\r\n\r\n#### New executors\r\n\r\nThe biggest change in this PR is the introduction of 7 distinct new VU executors:\r\n- [x] `shared-iterations`, a.k.a. `iterations` + `vus`.\r\n- [x] `constant-vus`, a.k.a. `duration` + `vus`.\r\n- [x] `ramping-vus`, a.k.a. `stages` + `vus`.\r\n- [x] `externally-controlled` is similar to `ramping-vus`, but the number of initialized and active VUs at any given time can be controlled by the k6 REST API - it's the only executor that could be paused or controlled while it's running (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/867, closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1028).\r\n- [x] `per-vu-iterations` is а new feature that allows each configured VU to execute an exact number of iterations; the shared iterations have caused confusion before and there are legitimate reasons people want an equal number of iterations for each VU (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/381, https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/663, https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/627, https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/378, and probably others).\r\n- [x] `constant-arrival-rate` executes a constant number of iterations per second (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/550).\r\n- [x] `ramping-arrival-rate` executes a variable number of iterations per second, specified as ramp-ups or ramp-downs `stages`, similar to how the `ramping-vus` is configured.\r\n\r\nThese executors can be configured via the new `execution` JS/JSON option. For now, they aren't directly configurable via CLI flags or environment variables.\r\n\r\nHowever, most of the old simple k6 uses where `stages`, or `iterations` or `duration` are specified in any way, including via CLI flags and env vars, are still supported. They are just transparently converted to their respective new `execution` executor configurations. There are some breaking changes here, described in detail in the *Breaking Changes* section below, but generally only when there is a conflict or ambiguity in the specified configuration.\r\n\r\n#### Other new features\r\n\r\n- [x] Multiple different executors can be configured in a single test run, both sequentially and in parallel (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/239).\r\n- [x] Each executor has a `startTime` property, which defines at what time relative to the test run start it will start executing.\r\n- [x] VUs are reused between the different configured executors when that's possible.\r\n- [x] Executors have new `gracefulStop` property that allows for iterations to complete gracefully for some amount of time after the normal executor duration is over (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/879); even with `gracefulStop=0`, i.e. the old behavior, metrics are emitted and processed in a much saner way (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1033)\r\n- [x] Validation of the supplied execution configuration is very strict (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/875 and slightly helps with https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/883)\r\n- [x] There is a new feature called execution segments that allows tests to be easily partitioned between multiple k6 instances (implements the execution parts of https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/997 and helps towards https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/140 and https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/864)\r\n- [x] There are separate descriptions and real-time thread-safe progress bars for each individual executor.\r\n- [x] Different executors can execute different functions than the `default` exported one.\r\n- [x] Different executors can have different environment variables.\r\n\r\n### Example of the new config\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport let options = {\r\n  scenarios: {\r\n    stages_up_down: {\r\n      executor: \"ramping-vus\",\r\n      startVUs: 0,\r\n      stages: [\r\n        { duration: \"10s\", target: 20 },\r\n        { duration: \"10s\", target: 0 },\r\n      ],\r\n      gracefulRampDown: \"0s\",\r\n      gracefulStop: \"0s\",\r\n    },\r\n    stages_down_up: {\r\n      executor: \"ramping-vus\",\r\n      startVUs: 20,\r\n      stages: [\r\n        { duration: \"10s\", target: 0 },\r\n        { duration: \"10s\", target: 20 },\r\n      ],\r\n      gracefulRampDown: \"0s\",\r\n      gracefulStop: \"0s\",\r\n    },\r\n    const_loop_vus: {\r\n      executor: \"constant-vus\",\r\n      vus: 20,\r\n      duration: \"20s\",\r\n      gracefulStop: \"0s\",\r\n    },\r\n    constant_arr_rate: {\r\n      executor: \"constant-arrival-rate\",\r\n      rate: 20,\r\n      timeUnit: \"1s\",\r\n      duration: \"10s\",\r\n      preAllocatedVUs: 10,\r\n      maxVUs: 20,\r\n      startTime: \"20s\",\r\n      gracefulStop: \"0s\",\r\n    },\r\n    variable_arr_rate: {\r\n      executor: \"ramping-arrival-rate\",\r\n      startRate: 20,\r\n      timeUnit: \"1s\",\r\n      preAllocatedVUs: 10,\r\n      maxVUs: 20,\r\n      startTime: \"20s\",\r\n      stages: [\r\n        { target: 0, duration: \"5s\" },\r\n        { target: 20, duration: \"5s\" },\r\n      ],\r\n      gracefulStop: \"0s\",\r\n    },\r\n    per_vu_iters: {\r\n      executor: \"per-vu-iterations\",\r\n      vus: 20,\r\n      iterations: 10,\r\n      startTime: \"30s\",\r\n      maxDuration: \"10s\",\r\n      gracefulStop: \"10s\",\r\n    },\r\n    shared_iters: {\r\n      executor: \"shared-iterations\",\r\n      vus: 20,\r\n      iterations: 200,\r\n      startTime: \"30s\",\r\n      maxDuration: \"10s\",\r\n      gracefulStop: \"10s\",\r\n    },\r\n    adjustable_at_will: {\r\n      executor: \"externally-controlled\",\r\n      vus: 5,\r\n      maxVUs: 10,\r\n      duration: \"40s\",\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default function () {\r\n  console.log(`Start VU ${__VU} ITER ${__ITER}`);\r\n  sleep(0.5 + Math.random() * 0.5);\r\n  console.log(`Done VU ${__VU} ITER ${__ITER}`);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n\r\nThere are a few breaking changes caused by this PR:\r\n- Execution config options (`execution`, `stages`, `iterations`, `duration`) from \"upper\" config layers overwrite execution options from \"lower\" (i.e. CLI flags > environment variables > JS options > JSON options) config layers. For example, the `--iterations` CLI flag will overwrite any execution options set as environment variables (e.g. `K6_DURATION`, `K6_STAGES`, etc.) or script options (`stages: [ /* ... */]`, `execution: { /* ... */ }`, etc. ).\r\n- Using different execution config options on the same level is now a configuration conflict error and will abort the script. For example, executing `k6 run --duration 10s --stages 5s:20 script.js` won't work (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/812). The only exception is combining `duration` and `iterations`, which will result in a `shared-iterations` executor with the specified non-default `maxDuration` (https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1058).\r\n- The k6 REST API for controlling script execution (i.e. the `k6 pause`, `k6 scale` commands) now only works when a `externally-controlled` executor is configured in the `execution` config. The initial pausing of a test (i.e. `k6 run --paused script.js`) still works with all executor types, but once the test is started with `k6 resume` (or the corresponding REST API call), it can't be paused again unless only the `externally-controlled` executor is used.\r\n- Previously, running a script with `k6 run --paused script.js` would have still executed the script's `setup()` function (if it was present and wasn't explicitly disabled with `--no-setup`) and paused immediately after. Now, k6 will pause before it executes `setup()`.\r\n- The `vusMax` / `K6_VUS_MAX` / ` -m` / `--max` option is deprecated - it was previously used for the control of the initialized VUs by the REST API. Since that has now been restricted to the `externally-controlled` executor, the equivalent option there is called `maxVUs`.\r\n- Tests with infinite duration are now only possible via the `externally-controlled` executor.\r\n- Previously, all iterations were interruptible - as soon as the specified `duration` expired, or when VUs were ramped down in a stage, any running iterations were interrupted. Now all executors besides the `externally-controlled` one have a `gracefulStop` period of `30s` by default (closes https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/898). Additionally, `ramping-vus` executor has a `gracefulRampDown` parameter that configures the ramp-down grace period. For those periods, no new iterations will be started by the executors, but any currently running iterations will be allowed up to the specified periods to finish their execution.\r\n\r\n### Broken

thanks for the information and sorry for the inconvenience. We forgot to update this issue, but we actually realized that the cause of these panics is the current scheduling and reuse of VUs. As you've pointed out, it can be triggered by rapid ramping up and down of VUs, and we've also seen the panics manifest when the k6 REST API is used to set the number of VUs directly. In these situation, k6 sometimes doesn't properly wait for the execution in a VU to finish before it tries to reuse it again, thus executing multiple things in the same JS runtime and causing a panic. \r\n\r\nDue to the heavy refactoring needed to properly fix the underlying cause, we chose not to directly fix it with the current scheduler, and instead fixed it as part of https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1007, which involved rewriting the execution scheduling code anyway. We plan to finish that PR and merge it in `master` in the next several weeks, so hopefully this bug will be gone then.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/529311523/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2617449489,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYxNzQ0OTQ4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/2617449489","actor":{"login":"tateexon","id":10238396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjM4Mzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10238396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon","html_url":"https://github.com/tateexon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-09T05:58:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2617449490,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MTc0NDk0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/2617449490","actor":{"login":"tateexon","id":10238396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjM4Mzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10238396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon","html_url":"https://github.com/tateexon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-09T05:58:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/529520627","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/867#issuecomment-529520627","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/867","id":529520627,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyOTUyMDYyNw==","user":{"login":"tateexon","id":10238396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjM4Mzk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10238396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon","html_url":"https://github.com/tateexon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tateexon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-09T15:04:47Z","updated_at":"2019-09-09T15:04:47Z","body":"@na--
