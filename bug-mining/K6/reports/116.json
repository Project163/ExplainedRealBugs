can be problematic, because especially with timeouts, the original HTTP call might have gotten through. If that is the case, retrying the request could actually start the test 2 times, costing users money. So, for this initial request, we should either disable retrying, or figure out a safer way to do it that avoids starting multiple test runs inadvertently.","closed_by":{"login":"cuonglm","id":4304764,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDQ3NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4304764?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuonglm","html_url":"https://github.com/cuonglm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuonglm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuonglm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuonglm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuonglm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuonglm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuonglm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuonglm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuonglm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cuonglm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1205/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
