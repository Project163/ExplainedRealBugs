Just a couple of comments on the proposed API:\r\n- I prefer `abort()` as the name of the new function, as proposed in the other issue. It's makes it more clear that we're aborting the whole test. `exit()` also has connotations of immediate termination, while k6 actually has to perform some housekeeping when it aborts tests, like sending latest metrics to collectors, etc.\r\n- This likely shouldn't be a global function, rather it would probably be better if users have to import it as `import { abort, sleep } from \"k6\";`\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/484359921/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-18T05:27:31Z","updated_at":"2019-04-18T05:27:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/939","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/939/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/939/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/939/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/939","id":417814652,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTc4MTQ2NTI=","number":939,"title":"Require

becoming clear that the current [`Collector` interface](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/bdd417e8a4206c6bbbef36d7ce7bea48f34a0804/lib/collector.go#L32-L72) isn't very fit for purpose. It is a poor fit for a lot of the outputs ([[1]](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/bdd417e8a4206c6bbbef36d7ce7bea48f34a0804/stats/statsd/common/collector.go#L102-L108), [[2]](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/bdd417e8a4206c6bbbef36d7ce7bea48f34a0804/stats/kafka/collector.go#L96-L107), [[3.1]](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/master/stats/json/collector.go#L78-L82), [[3.2]](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/bdd417e8a4206c6bbbef36d7ce7bea48f34a0804/stats/json/collector.go#L136-L143), [[4]](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/bdd417e8a4206c6bbbef36d7ce7bea48f34a0804/stats/influxdb/collector.go#L190-L196), [[5]](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1067)), it leads to some code duplication and makes correctly writing new thread-safe outputs relatively difficult, and it also doesn't offer enough functionality for more complicated outputs (https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1074). The same thing even has multiple names - what we call `Collector`s in the code live in the [`stats` folder](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/tree/master/stats) and are presented as [\"outputs\"](https://docs.k6.io/docs/results-output) to users...\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the thresholds and the end-of-test summary are basically somewhat special-purpose outputs... They ingest metrics and do some calculations on them - the summary just spews the aggregated results at the end of the test, while thresholds do some calculations and potentially abort the test execution... They are enabled by default, but can be disabled by users. I'm not sure if it makes sense to refactor them into outputs for just a marginal improvement of code quality, but it should at least be investigated...\r\n\r\nI think that when we're investigating the telegraf integration (https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1064), we should also investigate their output pipeline architecture. Since their main job is dealing with metrics, there are probably things we can learn from them... \r\n\r\nOther somewhat related issues: https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/917,

discussed this a bit internally, and this is the specification we arrived at:\r\n\r\n- The function name should be `abortTest()` and it should be in the root `k6` JS module (i.e. it should be accessible from test scripts via `import { abortTest } from 'k6'`).\r\n- Once called, `abortTest()` should stop the whole test run and the k6 process should exit with a custom fixed non-zero exit code `107`.\r\n- In contrast to the old way of stopping the test run (a threshold on a custom metric with `abortOnFail: true`) mentioned above, `abortTest()` should make sure that the VU that called it stops immediately after, i.e. no more instructions from its current iteration are executed and no more iterations are started. \r\n- The `teardown()` function should still be executed after the test run aborts in this way.\r\n- The run status of the test run should be [`aborted by script`](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/9d973f564f5a8e3754fa51be4b22a03295cbae9e/lib/collector.go#L47) (e.g. for when `k6 run --out cloud` is used)\r\n\r\nSo, a JS script that uses it should look somewhat like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport http from 'k6/http';\r\nimport { abortTest, sleep } from 'k6';\r\n\r\nexport default function () {\r\n    // ... some test logic ...\r\n    if (Math.random() < 0.01) { // or some actual test abort check\r\n        console.log('mayday, mayday');\r\n        abortTest();\r\n        console.log('this should never be executed');\r\n    }\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/802062027/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4488454392,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ0ODg0NTQzOTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/4488454392","actor":{"login":"gernest","id":6039952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzk5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6039952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest","html_url":"https://github.com/gernest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b8defaec71d2f9060b1fb34928773d91648cfbf2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gernest/k6/commits/b8defaec71d2f9060b1fb34928773d91648cfbf2","created_at":"2021-03-22T07:52:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"gernest","id":6039952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzk5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6039952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest","html_url":"https://github.com/gernest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gernest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-22T08:02:38Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T08:02:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1920","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1920/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1920/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1920/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/1920","id":837439318,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTk3Nzc1MTA2","number":1920,"title":"
