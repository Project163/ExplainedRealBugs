Because ideally I want to create some Grafana dashboards that distill down a bunch of results into some easy-to-reason stats like \"this endpoint is 30% faster than it was last month\".  With InfluxDB-backed dashboards, I can plot two lines and let the viewer make their own visual determination, but with Graphite, I could do the math for them.\r\n\r\nIf k6 outputted to statsd, then statsd could feed into InfluxDB, Graphite, DataDog, whatever... (edited)\r\n\r\nemily [8:40 AM] \r\nWe could totally add statsd support, Collectors live rather independent of the rest of the application and adding one would be really easy, but I don't think it should be the only option; `-o influxdb=http://localhost:8086/k6` makes for much nicer onboarding than having to spin up a statsd proxy in front of InfluxDB to get your metrics in there","closed_by":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/196/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/196/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
