to how k6 supports blacklisting of IP ranges it should allow blacklisting of hostnames, including wildcards.\r\n\r\nI propose we add this functionality as follows:\r\n\r\n- If the hostname of a requested URL matches an entry in the blacklist no DNS, TCP or HTTP traffic is generated to that host whatsoever, and the necessary `error_code` and `error` tags should be emitted and a JS `BlacklistedHotname` error will be thrown, that unless caught will exit the current VU iteration.\r\n- A new CLI option `--blacklist-hostname HOSTNAME` that can be specified multiple times, and where `HOSTNAME` can contain `*` wildcards.\r\n- A new env var option `K6_BLACKLIST_HOSTNAMES` with a comma separated list of hostnames to block, again wildcards allowed.\r\n- A new JS option `blacklistHostnames`:\r\n```js\r\nexport let options = {\r\n    blacklistHostnames: [\"example.com\", \"*.example.com\"]\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nPointers for implementation:\r\n- See how the blacklisting of IP blocks is implemented:
