by [this PR comment](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2813/files#r1085128216), I am opening this issue as a gathering place for all of the problems with the current `lib.Runner` interface (and its main `js.Runner` implementation): \r\nhttps://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/1d99b0be9194bf9aaf86c070dd0d34604f266abe/lib/runner.go#L41-L85\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is probably the name itself. `Runner` is a very poor fit for what is essentially a VU factory.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is the current API. It is too broad, and the `Runner` it is both a factory for creating new VUs, but also something that can run lifecycle functions like `setup()`, `teardown()` and `handleSummary()` in a transient VU. There is probably no reason these two functionalities to be in the same object.

following script: \r\n```javascript\r\nimport { Counter } from \"k6/metrics\";\r\nimport { group } from \"k6\";\r\nconst delay = () => { return Promise.resolve(); } // this is just a placeholder for something useful.\r\nlet l = new Counter(\"my coutner\")\r\n\r\nexport default () => {\r\n    group(\"coolgroup\", () => {\r\n        l.add(1) // nice\r\n\r\n        delay(1).then(() => {\r\n                l.add(1)// not so nice\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill *not* emit \"my counter\" with \"group=coolgroup\". \r\n\r\nTo that the user will need to wrap the inner parts of the `then` in a group as in \r\n```javascript\r\nimport { Counter } from \"k6/metrics\";\r\nimport { group } from \"k6\";\r\nconst delay = () => { return Promise.resolve(); }\r\nlet l = new Counter(\"my coutner\")\r\n\r\nexport default () => {\r\n    group(\"coolgroup\", () => {\r\n        l.add(1) // nice\r\n\r\n        delay(1).then(() => {\r\n            group(\"coolgroup\", () => {\r\n                l.add(1)// not so nice\r\n            });\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because `group` is kind of \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport exec from \"k6/execution\"\r\nfunction group (name, fn) {\r\n  let oldGroup = exec.vu.tags[\"group\"];\r\n  exec.vu.tags[\"group\"] = oldGroup + \":\" + name;\r\n  try {\r\n    fn() // the actual inner function\r\n  } finally {\r\n    exec.vu.tags[\"group\"] = oldGroup;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the `then` \"callbacks\" get called only after the stack is empty the whole `group` code would have been executed, resetting the group back to the root name (which is empty). And when the `then` get's called it will have an empty group. \r\n\r\nThe \"workaround\" works as it just calls `group` again. \r\n\r\nA more hacking but ... more useful workaround is \r\n```javascript\r\nimport { Counter } from \"k6/metrics\";\r\nimport { group } from \"k6\";\r\nconst delay = () => { return Promise.resolve(); }\r\nlet l = new Counter(\"my coutner\")\r\n\r\nlet originalThen = Promise.prototype.then;\r\nPromise.prototype.then = function(onResolved, onRejected) {\r\n    let o = onResolved\r\n    onResolved = function(res) {\r\n        group(\"coolgroup\", () => { // this in practice will need to get hte group name\r\n            o(res);\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n    // https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55413715/cant-i-overwrite-the-then-function-of-promise\r\n    return originalThen.call(originalThen.call(this, onResolved, onRejected), undefined, error => {\r\n        console.log(`upload the error to server: ${error}`);\r\n        throw error;\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default () => {\r\n    group(\"coolgroup\", () => {\r\n        l.add(1) // nice\r\n\r\n        delay(1).then(() => {\r\n            l.add(1)// not so nice\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ... likely has *other* problems. \r\n\r\n### Solutions: \r\n\r\nI would argue this might be just showing that `group` is a *bad* abstraction and should be deprecated. It makes little sense in a lot of the cases. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand people are using it (albeit sometimes wrongly) and likely will still want to use it once k6 has a lot more async APIs (which return promises). \r\n\r\nSome of those can be fixed in the actual go code - it can get the `group` before returning the promise. Which in practice is needed as getting the group in a goroutine while js code is runnign si racy as `group()` call can be made, changing it, while the goroutine gets it.\r\n\r\nThis in no way helps though  with later `.then` calls. \r\n\r\nSo for a more real example \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ndelay(1).then(() => {\r\n  return anotherPromise();\r\n}).then((resultFromAnotherPromise)=>{\r\n  return morepromises();\r\n}.then((.....\r\n```\r\nfor all of those setting `group` will currently not work great. \r\n\r\n### `async`/`await` support:\r\n\r\nWhile we *might* be able to fix some of this for case wher `group(\"name\" , async function () {...})` through just doing some magic in `group` - that will likely only work for the `await` usages, but not if you then ( :wink: ) call `.then` or something. \r\n\r\n So it might work great for some of the \"async\" stuff but not for the other. \r\n\r\n### pure callbacks\r\n\r\nIf somebody has an API that just have callbacks ... having them support `group` will be on a case by case callback basis. They will need to make certain to get the `group` from where the `callback` is defined and then when making it to set the `group` ... and then unset it.\r\n\r\n### API changes \r\n\r\nI guess it is possible for the `js/eventloop` to provide API to ...that, but that will likely be quite involved, but might be the easiest way forward.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2728/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2728/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8513674801,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAz4Wr85ckFhmzwAAAAH7dF4x","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/8513674801","actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b36bb5c4521e4ec35b6752dc044e7bda753cb099","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/commits/b36bb5c4521e4ec35b6752dc044e7bda753cb099","created_at":"2023-02-14T10:16:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-14T10:19:29Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T10:19:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2915","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2915/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2915/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2915/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2915","id":1583886798,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAz4Wr85J7hdx","number":2915,"title":"k6.check:

this check was only returning `false` if it also could emit it, and true otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis should rarely be a problem as the same context that is being checked here is the one that interrupts the VM - so no code will be able to run after this.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the code checking if it should be emitted is racing with the one that interrupts the VM. So it is possible for the VM to still not be interrupted when a `check` returns a wrong value. It is even possible for more code to be run before the interrupt is actually called.\r\n\r\nThe code still checks the context as this also updates the internal check structure and we don't want to that if the context is done.

Why? \r\n\r\nAs explained in https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2728 `group` doesn't work with async functions (or execution). \r\n\r\nThis is not specific to `group` - anything that keeps state has problems with keeping that state in async execution. \r\n\r\nThis is more explored in the issue above and in this tc39 [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context). \r\n\r\n# What? \r\n\r\nAs the problem is so generic and was already kind of tried to be fixed for `group` in https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/2863 the point of this is to have a little bit mroe generic solution akin to the one in the tc39 proposal above.\r\n\r\nThis is a research task trying to make that possible and then make it possible to implement a `group` like API for async functions. \r\n\r\nProbably after #2869 is also fixed. \r\n\r\nThe two issues though are orhogonal.\r\n\r\nThis can also be though of as continuation of

What?\r\n\r\nGroup and check were tightly coupled between them and also to the end of test summary and the REST API.\r\n\r\nThis change the tight coupling is removed. Group and check no longer interact with each other while being run.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the same end of test summary and REST API behavior the code makes the same aggregation it used to be but *only* based on the metrics emitted by `check` and `group`.\r\n\r\nThere are several breaking changes still in it as a bunch of things are no longer useful, and technically not implementable if we want to remove the tight coupling.\r\n\r\nThe only one that is relevant though is that\r\n`lib.State` no longer has `Group`.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 extensions using that and both of them use it to use the \"magic\" that tight `group` and `check` together.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nThe previous code apart from having problems code smell wise, meant that you can't implement this functionality in JS.\r\n\r\nWhich also means that they act very strangely especially as if you do not look closely it just seems like they set a few tags and emit metrics. \r\n\r\nWhile working on #2728 it became apparent that it is unlikely we will get a perfect solution and one of the big problems is that you can't even experiment without having to write a fairly complicated async go code.\r\n\r\nSo this also makes that issue a bit more actionable. And definitely a thing that now people can have not perfect or even 80%, but still workable for them solutions.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nIf you haven't read the contributing guidelines https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md \r\nand code of conduct https://github.com/grafana/k6/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md yet, please do so\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my code.\r\n- [ ] I have added tests for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have run linter locally (`make lint`) and all checks pass.\r\n- [x] I have run tests locally (`make tests`) and all tests pass.\r\n- [x] I have commented on my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.\r\n<!-- - [ ] Any other relevant item -->\r\n\r\n## Related PR(s)/Issue(s)\r\n\r\n#2869","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/3750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/3750/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12954827082,"node_id":"COE_lADOAz4Wr85ckFhmzwAAAAMEKvlK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/12954827082","actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"connected","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-28T09:47:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12968243937,"node_id":"CE_lADOAz4Wr85ckFhmzwAAAAME97Lh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/12968243937","actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"39951aba679ac2da0ee89f8aa2d8a5724d282af8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/commits/39951aba679ac2da0ee89f8aa2d8a5724d282af8","created_at":"2024-05-29T08:48:15Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12968244013,"node_id":"CE_lADOAz4Wr85ckFhmzwAAAAME97Mt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/events/12968244013","actor":{"login":"mstoykov","id":312246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjI0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov","html_url":"https://github.com/mstoykov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mstoykov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-29T08:48:15Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
