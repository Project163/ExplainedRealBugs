`k6 run` aborts due to a JS code error/exception in a portion of script code that's imported as a module, the stack trace k6 prints out is not displaying the correct line numbers of the calls leading to the error.\r\nIf the code error happens in the main script file -- i.e. the one that contains the default export -- the line number is correct.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n`k6 version`: k6 v0.29.0 (2020-11-11T13:27:19+0000/d9bced3, go1.15.3, darwin/amd64)\r\n- k6 version: 0.29.0\r\n- OS and version: macOS 10.14.6; also happening on Windows 10\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n`k6 run` should print the correct line number in the stack, whether the exception happened in the main JS or an imported module.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n`k6 run` prints an incorrect line number if the exception happens in an imported module JS. This makes debugging in bigger k6 projects really bothersome, as I have to resort to good old \"printf debugging\".\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce the Problem\r\nHere's a short simplified example code, consisting of the 'main' file with the default export and two further modules:\r\n#### stacktrace_linenumbers.js\r\n```javascript\r\nimport {f1} from \"./module1.js\"\r\n\r\nexport default function(){\r\n//    throw \"exception in default\"\r\n    f1()\r\n    console.log(\"in default\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n#### module1.js\r\n```javascript\r\nimport {f2} from \"./module2.js\"\r\n\r\nexport function f1(){\r\n//    throw \"exception in module1\"\r\n    f2()\r\n    console.log(\"in f1\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n#### module2.js\r\n```javascript\r\nexport function f2(){\r\n//    throw \"exception in module2\"\r\n    console.log(\"in f2\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUncommenting the `throw` in the main JS leads to the following printout:\r\n```\r\nMes-MacBook-Pro:k6-v0.29.0-mac me$ ./k6 run

 updated table in [comment](https://github.com/k6io/k6/issues/1933#issuecomment-838173237) to preserve history better\r\n\r\nI make this issue to discuss whether we will be updating each dependency and on what ... schedule.\r\n\r\nI would argue that while some dependencies are super important and later versions likely fix bugs and performance problems and it is worth our time updating them, others are either ones that we want to drop or are used in a single place for a single task and because of some specificity there is no point updating it regularly or at all.\r\n\r\nIn none of the cases, this means that a given library MUST be updated blindly or MUST NOT be updated if there turns out to be a good reason. Just that updating some libraries probably has more relevance than others and given our limited resources taking the time to update all of them constantly and fixing problems is probably not ... wanted.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, while I would prefer if some scripts are added to make this easier, I am definitely against this breaking the CI or preventing a release.\r\n\r\n### Goja\r\n\r\n[Goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja) is probably one of the bigger exceptions. It is what we use to run javascript and as any improvement can turn out to have a considerable either positive or negative impact on k6 we practically have to update it constantly. So even if something that we don't particularly care about is added/fixed we probably should update to it at least once each release cycle. In reality, there has been something useful more or less every month so we have been updating it constantly.\r\n\r\n### golang.org/x/*\r\n\r\nWhile those libraries are not part of the golang stdlib they either get embed in it in different forms or are the natural extension. They also happen to have a branch for each release so my proposal is to just update to the new branch each time we update the golang version so we follow it. Or even just at the beginning of each release just in case.\r\n\r\nGiven their ubiquity in general I don't expect it will be breaking constantly. If anything [not updating x/net has turned](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1734) out to be problematic albeit because we were at an extreme not updating it ...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Others:\r\n\r\nThe list below is what it was in go.mod and I am listing the `indirect` just for ease of checking against the go.mod. \r\n\r\nPost factum the categories are :\r\n- never - we either don't care about any updates as we use it for something extremely specific and  updating it won't help. Or the more common case it is something we want to drop.\r\n- every release - things that we more or less need to update as we are very dependant on it \r\n- 1-2 a year - things that we should be updating, but it is likely with minimal benefits and just doing it all the time has more chances of us running into problems then something else.\r\n \r\n\r\n| name | description | thoughts | proposed update period|\r\n|-----|---------|---|----|\r\n| github.com/Azure/go-ntlmssp | NTLM library | I am for updating it, but given our problems with testing it, I think that should wait | ~never for now~ 1-2 a year as we still need to update it |\r\n| github.com/DataDog/datadog-go | datadogd/statsd library | we haven't had any problems, but it is probably easy to test | at least once a year probably be more with better tests |\r\n| github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice | embed static files in go binaries | this should be replaceable by [embed](https://golang.org/pkg/embed/) | we should drop it not update it |\r\n| github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery | like jquery | used in `k6/html` mostly, probably something that should be updated given that it has chances to introduce performance and compatibility fixes, but is probably somewhat risky | 1-2 a year |\r\n| github.com/Shopify/sarama | kafka library | we intend [on dropping it so](https://github.com/k6io/k6/pull/1917) .... | never | \r\n| github.com/Shopify/toxiproxy | indirect (probably by sarama) / introduce network problems|  this could be useful but I prefer to first drop it with `sarama` and then figure out whether we will be using something like that. We currently don't vendor it as it is only used in tests | never |\r\n| github.com/Soontao/goHttpDigestClient  | digest authentication | this is easier to test than NTLM so we should probably be updating it | 1-2 a year |\r\n| github.com/andybalholm/brotli | brotli compression | possibly some performance improvement, so for updating every once in a while | 1-2 a year |\r\n| github.com/andybalholm/cascadia | indirect/ css selectors | | never directly |\r\n| github.com/daaku/go.zipexe | ndirect by go.rice | | never |\r\n| github.com/dlclark/regexp2 | indirect by goja | probably worth updating every once in a while as I am not certain if goja will do it | goja should update it as dependency |\r\n| github.com/dop251/goja | js VM | see part above | at least once a release  |\r\n| github.com/dustin/go-humanize | humanize numbers | used in stats for bytes and floats ... we can probably drop it and either way I don't think we need to update it | never - hopefully it will be dropped with #1806 |\r\n| github.com/eapache/go-resiliency | indirect by sarama  / resiliency patterns | |  never | \r\n| github.com/eapache/go-xerial-snappy |  indirect by sarama / snappy | | never | \r\n| github.com/eapache/queue |  indirect by sarama | | never | \r\n| github.com/fatih/color | color library | we use it, I doubt any updates to it are useful, but maybe something useful has been added | once a year just to keep up|\r\n| github.com/gedex/inflector | indirect by jsonapi | | never |\r\n| github.com/ghodss/yaml | indirect by strvals which is used in kafka and lib/types/dns | | never |\r\n| github.com/gin-contrib/sse | indirect by gin | | never | \r\n| github.com/gin-gonic/gin | indirect by api2go | | never | \r\n| github.com/go-sourcemap/sourcemap | indirect by goja | we currently don't [use sourcemaps](https://github.com/k6io/k6/issues/1789), but probably can update it.

This might be useful in other places, but likely will be dropped, and likely there are no reasons to update it if it works  | never |\r\n| github.com/nu7hatch/gouuid | uuid lib | used by digest lib

github.com/pierrec/xxHash |  indirect by lz4 | | never |\r\n| github.com/pkg/errors | errors handling | used through out k6, but I think we can just move the stdlib ? | never |\r\n|

used by k6 directly as it seems useful, but currently is only dependency of sarama | never |\r\n| github.com/serenize/snaker | snake case utility | used by `k6/html` and the \"bridge\", likely not a problem to update, but also probably not very useful | 1-2 a year |\r\n| github.com/sirupsen/logrus | logging library | not really interesting to update IMO it is also in maintenance mode | 1-2 a year

github.com/spf13/pflag | flag parsing | same as above | -12 a year | \r\n| github.com/stretchr/testify | testing library | we do use it quite a lot, I doubt anything but new methods will come from updates so I am fine updating it | 1-2 a year | \r\n| github.com/tidwall/gjson | xpath for json | used for `k6/http` , probably good idea to keep updating, wonder but we some review as this could be breaking changes | 1-2 a year |\r\n| github.com/tidwall/pretty | json prettifier | used by gjson and har converter, possibly dropped when we drop the har converter | with w/e gjson needs |\r\n|
