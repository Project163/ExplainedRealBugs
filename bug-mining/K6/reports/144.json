because of https://community.k6.io/t/warn-0000-error-getting-terminal-size/767\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n- k6 version: v0.27.0\r\n- OS and version: Windows\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nRunning a script with k6 shouldn't panic, ever. \r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\nFor some terminals, k6 isn't able to get the current terminal width (needed for the new responsive progressbars) for some unknown reason, so it emits this warning: \r\n```\r\n WARN[0000] error getting terminal size error=“The handle is invalid.”\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen it panics with ` panic: runtime error: integer divide by zero` :disappointed: \r\n\r\nmy theory is that this code works as intended and falls back to width of 80:
