seen in [this issue](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/950), `console.log()` could be quite useful in the init context for debugging purposes.\r\n\r\nThe main user-facing problem with this it the fact that code in the init context is executed multiple times. Off the top of my head, it's executed once in the beginning of a k6 run to get the exported script `options`, once for `setup()`, once for the initialization in each VU, and once in `teardown()`. So if we enable this by default, it's going to be quite noisy...\r\n\r\nThere are 2 somewhat major things from an implementation perspective that are potentially problematic. First, the logger for each runtime (i.e. VU) is currently in the [`lib.State` struct](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/cf8bccc76f1d3f7095a767b5bf71488200db340c/lib/state.go#L47), which isn't available in the init context. In fact, its [presence](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/cf8bccc76f1d3f7095a767b5bf71488200db340c/js/modules/k6/metrics/metrics.go#L52-L54) of [absence](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/cf8bccc76f1d3f7095a767b5bf71488200db340c/js/modules/k6/k6.go#L71-L74) are often how we verify whether a particular piece of k6 Go code is executed in the VU or init context respectively...\r\n\r\nThe second issue stems from the fact that we likely can't enable this logging by default due to its noisiness. This likely means that we have to hide it behind a flag. Unfortunately, it can't be a JS option only, since those are retrieved after the init context is executed once. But it seems like something minor that doesn't deserve its own CLI/environment variable flag...\r\n\r\nSo, here's an initial proposal that needs to be further evaluated for feasibility:\r\n- By default, trying `console.log()` in the init context will return an error. But it won't be the current `ReferenceError: console is not defined`, rather it will be something like `Using console.log() in the init context only works when verbose mode is enabled. You can do that with the --verbose/-v CLI flags or the K6_VERBOSE environment variable.`\r\n- If users turn on verbose mode, `console` [methods](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/blob/master/samples/logging.js) in the init context will start to work. Each message will likely be emitted multiple times, once per init context execution, unless there's an error somewhere in the code that aborts the script execution. \r\n- Ideally, users should be able to differentiate between the messages from different init context executions. This could be accomplished by adding a `source` field in each log message. And it's also somewhat tied to [this issue](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/889) about having VU numbers in the init context.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, more evaluation definitely needed, since this seemingly simple feature has a lot of complications if we want to get it

users can [`open()`](https://docs.k6.io/docs) files if they know their filenames, but they can't traverse the filesystem and open files dynamically. A few functions to navigate around the filesystem would help with the UX of writing file-heavy tests, as described in [this forum post](https://community.k6.io/t/allow-opening-folders-with-the-open-function/104).\r\n\r\nThis should probably happen after we have a reasonable way to not read the contents of every file in every VU, as `open()` currently does. So, as a quick fix, having the [`__VU` variable available in the init context](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/889) would do, but longer-term, something like https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/592 and https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/532 would be ideal.\r\n\r\nAnd an open question is whether we should try to emulate even parts of the `fs` node API, or if we should do something much simpler and narrower in scope. For now I'm definitely leaning toward the latter option...\r\n\r\n### Current workarounds:\r\n\r\n#### Describe desired files in a `.json` file:\r\nIf I have a `testfile.json` with an array of file names (or something more complicated with additional metadata), I can just open it, and then iterate over its contents to open all of the other files:\r\n```js\r\nlet fileContents = [];\r\nlet filePaths = JSON.parse(open(\"filenames.json\"));\r\n\r\nfilePaths.forEach(fileName => fileContents.push({\r\n    name: fileName,\r\n    contents: open(fileName, \"b\"),\r\n}));\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default function () {\r\n    // Do something with fileContents\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Pass a list of file as an [environment variable](https://docs.k6.io/docs/environment-variables)\r\n\r\nYou could run `k6 run --env filelist=\"file1;file2;file3\" script.js` and then use `__ENV.filelist` in the k6 script's init context to open all of the supplied files. Of course, the `filelist` value could also be dynamically generated (e.g. `--env filelist=\"$(find ./some/folder -type f -print0 | tr '\\0' ';')\"`), as long as we pay attention that the filenames don't contain the chosen separator. And, for the moment, that the separator [isn't a comma :beetle:](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1006) ...\r\n\r\n#### Load the files from an HTTP server\r\nAs the forum post suggested, the files could be located on a simple HTTP server. This way they can be retrieved in the `setup()` function or in the future [per-VU init function](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/785).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1005/reactions","total_count":18,"+1":18,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1005/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/526123835","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/889#issuecomment-526123835","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/889","id":526123835,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyNjEyMzgzNQ==","user":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T10:21:47Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T10:21:47Z","body":"Just wanted to add a note that implementing this after #1007 would be much better. That's because currently, when VUs are ramped down and then back up again, their `__VU` number gets reassigned. So even if we add a `__VU` number in the init context, that number may become different sometime down the line. As an example:\r\n```js\r\nimport { sleep } from \"k6\";\r\n\r\nexport let options = {\r\n    stages: [\r\n        { target: 10, duration: \"5s\" },\r\n        { target: 0, duration: \"5s\" },\r\n        { target: 10, duration: \"5s\" },\r\n    ],\r\n}\r\nexport default function () {\r\n    console.log(__VU)\r\n    sleep(3);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe maximum number that will be printed with k6 v0.25.1 is somewhere around 19-20, even though we only ever have 10 VUs at max. With the code from #1007, it's going to always be 10. This is because `__VU` is currently re-assigned with incremental values when the VU is put back into service during the second ramp-up, whereas in the new code the VU ID is assigned once and never changed.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/comments/526123835/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"na--","id":3336773,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY3NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336773?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--","html_url":"https://github.com/na--","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/na--/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-29T10:25:27Z","updated_at":"2019-08-29T10:25:27Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1131","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1131/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1131/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1131/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/1131","id":486869875,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0ODY4Njk4NzU=","number":1131,"title":"console.log

complicated handling of context in RunOnce is not necessary. Each\r\nof the new executors handles contexts and VUs very deliberately and\r\nprecisely. We can separate the context handling to interrupt goja\r\nruntime and the actual running user's code.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two new interfaces, \"InitializedVU\" annd \"ActiveVU\".\r\n\r\nInitializedVU is what Runner.NewVU will return, and is stored in\r\nExecutionState.vus buffer. Whenever a InitializedVU is pull from the\r\nbuffer, caller can call InitializedVU.Activate with VUActivationParams\r\nargument. This will return an ActiveVU, which will actually run the\r\nuser's code.\r\n\r\nThe InitializedVU.Activate will spawn a goroutine to track the context\r\nfor interrupting script execution, and calling the callback function and\r\nreturn the VU to the buffer.\r\n\r\nFixes #889\r\nFixes

Feature Description\n\nIn some cases, like this [forum question](https://community.k6.io/t/execution-order-question/2793), can be helpful to know which specific VU is executing the code or just know that the logs are generated by one of the `VUID == 0` (options resolution, babel transpiler, setup, teardown, handle summary).\r\n\r\nThis was originally [proposed](https://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/951#issuecomment-477652919) during the Init Context's implementation of the `console.log`.\n\n### Suggested Solution (optional)\n\n>And if we can fix the configuration challenges you describe (sob), have proper loggers per-VU, and actually implement #889 and attach (via log.WithFields()) the VU ID to each log message, any user confusion from multiple identical messages will likely disappear.\r\n\r\nThis suggested solution from the original issue is still a valid option.\n\n### Already existing or connected issues / PRs (optional)\n\nhttps://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/951\r\nhttps://github.com/grafana/k6/issues/2344 - We want to deprecate `common.Bind` that is how the `console.log` is defined. A refactor on that side will be for sure beneficial also for the current issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2361/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/2361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
