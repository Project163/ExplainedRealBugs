If we measure DNS lookup time as one of a number of \"sub-metrics\" and also have a \"total\" metric that adds up all the sub-metrics, it is unintuitive if one of the sub-metrics is not included in the aggregate metric. Why not keep these spikes, because they are there for the user trying to make the HTTP requests with a genuine client application, aren't they? If load testers don't want to see them they have to filter their data (something our cloud service may help them with, if they think it's a pain to do on their own). Also, one issue with removing DNS lookup times is that higher level metrics like page/group timings will then not correlate with total_load_time. Nah, collect and store raw data, then let people massage it themselves or have our cloud service do it for them!\r\nDec 18 at 9:19 PM - Edit - Delete\r\n\r\n**Robin Gustafsson**\r\nIn rload we remove the DNS lookup time from the total_load_time value (the rload equivalent to k6's http_req_duration) with the rationale that the global DNS system is very separate from the system's we're targeting with traffic (we're not load testing the DNS system) and it's difficult for us to know how DNS lookups are being cached at various levels (local machine, hosting providers, ISPs etc.).\r\n\r\nI vote for doing the same in k6, thoughts @uppfinnarn @ragnarlonn @artych?\r\nDec 16 at 5:23 PM - Reply - Delete\r\n\r\n**Artem Charykov**\r\n@uppfinnarn @ragnarlonn @robinegustafsson\r\n\r\nInitial spikes are cased by DNS look up time\r\nlooking_up time is greater than 0 only for the first request (for each user)\r\nlooking_up time has significant influence on the duration time\r\ntherefore k6 CLI statistics (shown at the end of the test) are confusing for both http_req_duration_time and http_req_looking_up (for example \"http_req_looking_up: avg=3.06ms, max=408.12ms, med=0s, min=0s, p90=620.74µs, p95=679.26µs\")\r\ndetails: https://loadimpact.quip.com/qzbrAkFaEY7m\r\nDec 16 at 5:07 PM (edited) - Reply - Add Link as Attachment - Delete\r\n\r\n**Emily Ekberg**\r\nI wonder if introducing some slight jitter to the start of a VU would help with this.
