implement the very old [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) and co.\r\n\r\nThe module has a single open issue https://github.com/grafana/xk6-timers/issues/3  and is used fairly commonly.\r\n\r\nThe functionality it provides is also needed to delay execution in ways similar to `sleep` but without blocking the event loop.\r\n\r\n## Blockers:\r\n1. ~https://github.com/grafana/xk6-timers/issues/3 - the issue should be fixed.~\r\n2. what will be the import path `k6/timers` ? Do we want to actually just have it globally, given how it is usually used in JS. That will add more intercompatibility with other JS engines.\r\n\r\n## Alternatives: \r\n\r\nWhile setTimeout and co are very old and known, they are not very promise/async/await friendly as they predate them.\r\n\r\nThe things that keeps poping out is `delay` both from\r\n1.
