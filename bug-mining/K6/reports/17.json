Possible syntax for this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncheck(obj, {\r\n    \"check name\": (obj) => /* ... */,\r\n}, { tag: \"value\" })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe biggest thing about this is that it's a breaking change - right now, passing multiple objects allows you to easily define groups of reusable checks. That would now require:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet reusable = { \"reusable check\": (obj) => /* ... */ };\r\n\r\n// Either ES6' Object.assign()...\r\ncheck(obj, Object.assign({\r\n    \"check name\": (obj) => /* ... */,\r\n}, reusable));\r\n\r\n// ...or the rest spread operator:\r\ncheck(obj, {\r\n    \"check name\": (obj) => /* ... */,\r\n    ...reusable,\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Rest Spread is [a stage 3 proposal](https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-rest-spread), and [implemented by babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-rest-spread/).)","closed_by":{"login":"liclac","id":428026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODAyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac","html_url":"https://github.com/liclac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liclac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
