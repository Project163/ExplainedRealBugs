illustrated by [this recent issue](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/1029), we might benefit from signing our binary releases with a valid key for Windows.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm not sure if that would prevent or even decrease future antivirus false-positive results, but even if we just make that \"_Do you want this app from an unknown publisher to make changes to your PC_\" warning dialog less scary, it's probably worth it. \r\n\r\nSome resources on the topic:\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/get-a-code-signing-certificate\r\n- https://www.rahulpnath.com/blog/code-signing-in-azure-devops-pipeline/\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/252226/signing-a-windows-exe-file\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/cryptography-tools\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/signtool\r\n\r\nPotentially connected issues: \r\n- Use Azure Pipelines for CI https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/issues/959:\r\n  Since it's a Microsoft service, it's worth investigating whether there is some sort of a better way to do binary signing there. I'm somewhat worried about just uploading our future code-signing key to a random CI service, so maybe they have some sort of a key enclave or managed signing or something that adds a bit of security and transparency to the process. \r\n- Chocolatey installation (this new PR https://github.com/loadimpact/k6/pull/1027 and the [current windows installation instructions](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6#windows))\r\n  Worth investigating if chocolatey, being a package manager, would actually benefit from this whole binary code-signing business. In the Linux world, it's not the binaries that are signed, but the different rpm/deb/apk/pacman/etc. packages...\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imiric","id":1009277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDkyNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1009277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric","html_url":"https://github.com/imiric","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imiric/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
