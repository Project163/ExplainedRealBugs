PR makes progress bars responsive to the terminal window width, replacing them with percentages when the shortest possible length is reached. See the individual commits for details.\r\n\r\nDemo on [st](https://st.suckless.org/): https://streamable.com/nrgs0\r\n\r\nBest results are achieved on GNU/Linux terminals because of [SIGWINCH](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Miscellaneous-Signals.html), but it works reasonably well in Windows. The poorest performance is under any terminal multiplexer, but I'm not sure how concerned we should be about that, or well, if there's anything we _can_ do about it. Untested on macOS terminals: testers needed! I've read about SIGWINCH support in some BSDs, so I'm hoping it works well in macOS too.\r\n\r\nThe rendering will be responsive by default, and in non-interactive terminals (e.g. CI) will fallback to a fixed compact mode (showing only percentages).\r\n\r\nPart of #1279 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grafana/k6/issues/1332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
