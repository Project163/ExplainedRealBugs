+Some Capybara drivers need to run against an actual HTTP server. Capybara takes
+care of this and starts one for you in the same process as your test, but on
+another thread. Selenium is one of those drivers, whereas RackTest is not.
+
+If you are using an SQL database, it is common to run every test in a
+transaction, which is rolled back at the end of the test, rspec-rails does this
+by default out of the box for example. Since transactions are usually not
+shared across threads, this will cause data you have put into the database in
+your test code to be invisible to Capybara.
+
+Cucumber handles this by using truncation instead of transactions, i.e. they
+empty out the entire database after each test. You can get the same behaviour
+by using a gem such as {database_cleaner}[https://github.com/bmabey/database_cleaner].
+
+It is also possible to force your ORM to use the same transaction for all
+threads.  This may have thread safety implications and could cause strange
+failures, so use caution with this approach. It can be implemented in
+ActiveRecord through the following monkey patch:
+
+    class ActiveRecord::Base
+      mattr_accessor :shared_connection
+      @@shared_connection = nil
+
+      def self.connection
+        @@shared_connection || retrieve_connection
+      end
+    end
+    ActiveRecord::Base.shared_connection = ActiveRecord::Base.connection
