I think that's part of the problem here. I know I rewrote it a while back, but it could be abbreviated still. This is how I imagine people reading it currently:\n\n> You can make an example group and tag it :type => :request. Oh by the way, :type => :acceptance works too. These are RSpec versions of Rails integration tests Capybara request specs blah blah. So actually scratch what I just said about :type => :request, stick your tests in spec/requests. Or spec/integration. See, easy!!\n\nI mean I get why all that is there, because we're assuming that people aren't using Rails, and then we say \"oh but if you do use Rails, then you can do this instead\".

this and forget to\ninclude 'capybara/rails'.\n\n@jnicklas, back when you added rails.rb, was there something that\nstopped you from autodetecting Rails (like `defined? Rails.version`)?\n\nI'm thinking that we could require capybara/rails.rb at load-time for\nCapybara, and wrap it in an `if defined? Rails.version` block.\n\nOne thing we'd have to deal with is deferring these lines in rails.rb\nuntil the Rails app has been loaded, or Rails.root won't be defined:\n\n```\nCapybara.asset_root = Rails.root.join('public')\nCapybara.save_and_open_page_path = Rails.root.join('tmp/capybara')\n```\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/3227736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joliss","id":524783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDc4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/524783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss","html_url":"https://github.com/joliss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7009632,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzAwOTYzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/events/7009632","actor":{"login":"gorn","id":19652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorn","html_url":"https://github.com/gorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gorn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2011-12-21T00:29:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
