Capybara doesn't control the number of opened requests, that's really dependent on your app and how many simultaneous requests it opens, and Capybara automatically shutting down drivers by default is a non-starter from a performance perspective (and from a user expectation perspective).  If the browser/puma are keeping open connections after the browser has been reset to `about:blank` that would seem to be a browser or puma issue.  Additionally, only a user can know what their setup is going to need from a concurrency perspective.  A README PR would be accepted if you can summarize the issue in a paragraph or so (probably in the Gotchas section)","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/508947078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"twalpole","id":16556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole","html_url":"https://github.com/twalpole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/508948270","html_url":"https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/2227#issuecomment-508948270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/2227","id":508948270,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwODk0ODI3MA==","user":{"login":"twalpole","id":16556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole","html_url":"https://github.com/twalpole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-06T19:21:54Z","updated_at":"2019-07-06T19:23:01Z","body":"Note:
