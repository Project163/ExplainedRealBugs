first pull request, go easy on me :)\n\nThis is in reference to issue #681. Basically if you had something like `select '4', from 'some_select_tag'` and both `<option value=\"4\">4</option>` and `<option value=\"14\">14</option>`, the `#find` method of `#select` would match both and raise a `ElementNotFound` error and a message saying that no element was found.
