I discovered that the @selenium tag on a test caused my RSpec Factory created records to not be seen by the selenium instance, while (after 2 days of debugging...) I found out that using the @javascript tag causes selenium to see the database.\n\nI have no idea why, but it would be good if the README reflected that e.g. Factory Girl cannot interact with the database used by the @selenium tag-fired selenium instance.\n\nAnyway, now it works, and thank you for a great library. I hope someone else can save this time I spent literally wading through forums ;-)\n","closed_by":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/494/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
