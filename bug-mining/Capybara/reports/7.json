(The 'rescue LoadError' was not being caught for some reason.)  Mongrel of course does not run in Ruby 1.9.  And Webrick is timing out on my 2.4 GHz Macbook Pro even with the 10 second wait loop.\n\nWhen I was doing standalone Culerity, I had great success with Thin instead of Mongrel.  It's fast and easy.  Could the Capybara server be built to either try Thin _then_ Mongrel _then_ Webrick (as Sinatra does), or else take a configuration option to select the server?\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/34/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/34/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
