":"Oh, interesting. I was under the impression that #find waited but #all did not wait. I see now that this is not quite the case.\n\nSpecifically, both #find and #all run a query to find the element(s) in question. Capybara will run this query again if it detects a Capybara::ElementNotFoundError, or an \"invalid element error\" -- this will come from the driver, so for instance Selenium might raise a Selenium::StaleElementReferenceError. It will then run the query over and over until `Capybara.default_wait_time` is reached (at which point it will raise the error).\n\nSo why does it seem that #find waits but #all does not? Because #find will raise a Capybara::ElementNotFoundError by default if it cannot find the element in question, which as we've seen will cause the query to get re-run, and #all will _not_. In other words #all still waits, but it fails a lot faster. \n\nIn response to\n\n> For #all to wait one of the count options would need to be passed\n\nIt looks like judging from the [code](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/master/lib/capybara/node/finders.rb#L152) that passing options to #all does modify the query that Capybara will run, but it doesn't necessarily cause it to wait longer. Specifically, if you provide `:count` Capybara will raise Capybara::ExpectationNotMet immediately if the number of elements found doesn't match your `:count` (and this is not in the list of errors that will cause the query to get retried, so the query is not retried).\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/91628152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mcmire","id":7371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire","html_url":"https://github.com/mcmire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/91629009","html_url":"https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1481#issuecomment-91629009","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1481","id":91629009,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkxNjI5MDA5","user":{"login":"mcmire","id":7371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire","html_url":"https://github.com/mcmire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcmire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-10T17:31:15Z","updated_at":"2015-04-10T17:32:35Z","body":"So to answer the OP, saying that #find is the only method that supports `Capybara.default_wait_time` isn't quite correct.
