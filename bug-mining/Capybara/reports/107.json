I think second one should fail too.\r\n\r\nWhy does it pass in the second case: as `do..end` block having lower precedence than `{..}` block, the block in the first expectation is attached to the `have_selector` matcher while the block in the second expectation is attached to the `#to` method.\r\n\r\nAdding parens can make the second expectation fail as expected:\r\n```ruby\r\n# will fail\r\nexpect(page).to(have_selector(\"input\") do\r\n  false\r\nend)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n```ruby\r\nexpect(page).to have_selector(\"input\") do |input|\r\n  input.value == \"42\"\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis expectation will pass regardless of the actual value in the input element, as the filter block is never evaluated.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSomething like this should fail:\r\n```ruby\r\nexpect(page).to have_selector(\"input\") do\r\n  false\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll submit a PR for this.","closed_by":{"login":"twalpole","id":16556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole","html_url":"https://github.com/twalpole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/2616/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/2616/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
