(Maybe that's obvious.) I'm 100% dependant on the wait time defined by Capybara.default_wait_time, as elements may not be present at once, due to Ajax calls not being finished.\n\nHowever, now I've encountered a similar problem, for which there does not seem to be an elegant solution to. The problem is that the button _is_ present, but it is not _enabled_ at once. So, I need something that will help me select a button from a locator string that is also enabled. I ended up monkey patching Capybara like this.\n\n``` Ruby\n\nmodule Capybara\n  class Session\n    def click_enabled_button(locator)\n      current_node.click_enabled_button(locator)\n    end\n  end\n\n  module Node\n    module Actions\n      def click_enabled_button(locator)\n        msg = \"no enabled button with value or id or text '#{locator}' found\"\n        find(:xpath, XPath::HTML.enabled_button(locator), :message => msg).click\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nmodule XPath\n  module HTML\n    def enabled_button(locator)\n      button(locator)[~attr(:disabled)]\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nDo you think this is the right way to do that? Is that something that may be implemented in Capybara? (If so, I guess I could make a pull request.)\n","closed_by":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
