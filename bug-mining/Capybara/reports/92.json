I'm assuming here that the implementation is to be considered correct and the docs, therefore, incorrect.\n\nAPI methods \"click_button\" and \"find_button\" both call down with identical parameters to \"find\", it's just that the first call also calls \"click\" on the result for you. However, the first says that the location parameter finds by \"Text, id or value\" (where \"text\" doesn't make a lot of sense for INPUT types of Submit or Image, and only marginally for BUTTON when complex HTML may be nested inside the tag). The \"find_button\" call has the more usual list of \"id, name or value\", which makes more sense. Either way, they really both ought to say the same thing, since they're implemented through the same call, at least according to the inline source code in the docs themselves.\n\nhttp://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Actions#click_button-instance_method\nhttp://rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/master/Capybara/Node/Finders#find_button-instance_method\n","closed_by":{"login":"twalpole","id":16556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole","html_url":"https://github.com/twalpole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1267/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
