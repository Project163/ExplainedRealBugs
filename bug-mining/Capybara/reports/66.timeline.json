There are still a couple of details to iron out, such as passing the type parameter to `have_text` as well, and making sure `has_selector(\"foo\", text => \"bar\", :visible => false)` behaves as intended, but that shouldn't affect you

master has a new `has_text?` matcher which excludes invisible content such as `<title>` elements and `display: none` elements.\n\nIts implementation uses the `Node#text` method, so the implication is that the behaviour of `Node#text` has now changed from returning all text to only returning visible text. This presents two problems:\n- Users will have trouble upgrading if they are using `Node#text` directly, or `has_content?` (which is now just an alias of `has_text?`)\n- There is no API for getting e.g. the text of the `<title>` element. This could be a valid user requirement and was previously supported by the `#text` method.\n\nI propose adding a `#visible_text` method and using that to implement `has_text?`, leaving the implementations of `#text` and `#has_content?` as they are in 1.1. (`#has_content?` can be deprecated but I believe `#text` remains useful for checking e.g. `<title>` text.) WDYT?\n\nRelated: #522\n\ncc @mkdynamic\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2564088212,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MjU2NDA4ODIxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/events/2564088212","actor":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-17T18:14:14Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
