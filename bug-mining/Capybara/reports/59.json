I could reproduce the flickering tests with Selenium that we've been seeing on Travis. I tried `rspec --order random:$i`, and it turns out that the flickeringness is not test order dependent but random (i.e. some kind of race condition).\n\nHere is an example failure:\n\n```\n  1) Capybara::Session selenium#within with CSS selector should click links in the given scope\n     Failure/Error: @session.body.should include('Bar')\n       expected \"\" to include \"Bar\"\n     # ./lib/capybara/spec/session/within_spec.rb:11:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'\n\n  2) Capybara::Session selenium#within with nested scopes should respect the inner scope\n     Failure/Error: @session.body.should include('Another World')\n       expected \"\" to include \"Another World\"\n     # ./lib/capybara/spec/session/within_spec.rb:76:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'\n```\n\nThe first offending test is this:\n\n``` ruby\n  context \"with XPath selector\" do\n    it \"should click links in the given scope\" do\n      @session.within(:xpath, \"//div[@id='for_bar']//li[contains(.,'With Simple HTML')]\") do\n        @session.click_link('Go')\n      end\n      @session.body.should include('Bar')  # <-------------- actual: \"\"\n    end\n  end\n```\n\nMy sense is that it has nothing to do with `within`, which is just a chained `find_elements` as far as I know. The flickering failure happens in other places as well: http://travis-ci.org/#!/jnicklas/capybara/jobs/2020450\n\nI'm thinking perhaps `@session.body` (=> `browser.page_source`) is causing the problem, where other matchers (like `has_content`) would retry repeatedly and smooth over Selenium returning `\"\"`.\n\nI can't reproduce it with [this gist](https://gist.github.com/3414141), however.\n\nAny ideas?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
