You made a [change fixing the bug](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/commit/ca4781f186831f46b0549220389c95357d0863db), but then reverted it.\n\nLet me tell you why your comment is wrong:\n\n> Just revisited this, and it seems that according to the HTML5 spec, textareas must not contain literal HTML. \n> It seems that browsers support this anyway, to a certain extent at least, but it does not seem to be wellformed markup. \n> I've reverted the change I made originally, since it does not seem to be in conformance with the spec.\n\n`textarea` is a **user input element** so user can write anything he wants within that input element. So we could verify that data to be valid. Whilst the bug does not allow us to do the job right.\n\nI beg you to apply the fix you've done already. \n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1032/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2564062080,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MjU2NDA2MjA4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/events/2564062080","actor":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-17T17:14:04Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
