Here's how Capybara currently implements reset:\n\n``` ruby\n    def reset!\n      if @touched\n        driver.reset!\n        assert_no_selector :xpath, \"/html/body/*\" if driver.browser_initialized?\n        @touched = false\n      end\n      @server.wait_for_pending_requests if @server\n      raise_server_error!\n    end\n```\n\nIn my case `assert_no_selector` is raising an unhandled alert error.\n\nThe reason `assert_no_selector` is called here in the first place is to make sure that resetting the session is synchronous. Instead of relying on the driver to make sure that it is, I thought that I could cheat and let Capybara handle this for the drivers. It seems that that was a mistake. That already became apparent in the need for the `browser_initialized?` hack. Of course we could handle this annoying case here as well, but there's no really way to rescue a Selenium-specific error here that isn't totally gross.\n\nIMO we should cut out losses on this one and simply force the driver to make sure that restting is synchronous.\n","closed_by":{"login":"twalpole","id":16556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole","html_url":"https://github.com/twalpole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1670/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
