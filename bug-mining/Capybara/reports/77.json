Capybara's RackTest driver was changed to respect this when reading the value but not when submitting the form.\n\nThat has lead me to a test using Capybara and TackTest where I'm not changing the value of a textarea form but submitting the form submits a different value than the original, one with a leading newline. I think all that needs to happen is the addition of same gsub added to Capybara::Node::Simple#value be added to the textarea case in Capybara::RackTest::Form#params.\n","closed_by":{"login":"twalpole","id":16556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole","html_url":"https://github.com/twalpole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1068/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
