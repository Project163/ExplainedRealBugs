This explains why my attempts to get Capybara to find a button by a value it'd find in the name attribute, were it looking, have been unsuccessful.\n\nhttps://github.com/jnicklas/xpath/blob/master/lib/xpath/html.rb#L22\n\nIt may be worth in Capybara's documentation simply making a reference to the relevant XPath details where you call through to that, in order to avoid duplication of documentation and possible synchronisation or transcription errors between the two. It should make future maintenance easier as well.\n\nI have also encountered confusion in others about what \"button\" means in this context - again, it goes down to XPath. XPath's own documentation on the \"button\" custom selector is a little out of date in fact, with the code searching for a wider range of input types than it describes, but in any event it'd be handy if the Capybara docs again just pointed through to the right bit of XPath so that it's really obvious to the API client who does what and how we should expect things to behave.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/37602439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pond","id":188364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODM2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pond","html_url":"https://github.com/pond","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pond/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pond/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pond/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pond/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pond/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pond/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pond/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pond/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pond/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":101949018,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEwMTk0OTAxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/events/101949018","actor":{"login":"abotalov","id":1497867,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTc4Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1497867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov","html_url":"https://github.com/abotalov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-03-14T07:06:25Z","label":{"name":"Documentation","color":"207de5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":392191742,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5MjE5MTc0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/events/392191742","actor":{"login":"twalpole","id":16556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole","html_url":"https://github.com/twalpole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6b7c0eeb4188806d06de5292bf8bc25cbce517a2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/commits/6b7c0eeb4188806d06de5292bf8bc25cbce517a2","created_at":"2015-08-25T21:50:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":392191868,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzkyMTkxODY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/events/392191868","actor":{"login":"twalpole","id":16556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole","html_url":"https://github.com/twalpole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalpole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-08-25T21:51:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":n
