The current implementation uses a simple 4 second timeout.  However, sometimes I set breakpoints in my controllers or models while running cucumber to troubleshoot something.  In this case, the 4 second timeout occurs and I get an infinite redirect error even though it wasn't actually an infinite redirect.\n\nMaybe this would be a better approach?  Track all the redirect URLs since the last user-initiated request, and if a redirect occurs to the same URL more than twice, consider it an infinite redirect.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/67/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/67/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
