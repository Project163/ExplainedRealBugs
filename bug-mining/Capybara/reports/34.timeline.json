I recently encountered it myself, and tried to figure it all out. Here's how it is now, as best as I can figure:\n1. Capybara gets a UTF-8 string as a param, that string contains a multibyte char (say `å`)\n2. Capybara forces this string into binary encoding, essentially leaving it unencoded\n3. Capybara passes this string into Rack-Test\n4. Rack-Test tries to escape the string via Rack::Utils.escape\n5. Rack::Utils tries to find all non-alphanumeric characters and URL encode them, it uses a UTF-8 regexp for this\n6. Matching the UTF-8 regexp against the binary string fails, probably because Ruby can't figure out what the hell to do with the unencoded `å`.\n\nSo this presents a pretty tricky problem. The idea up until now has been that, since a browser would not be sending the strings in a specific encoding, and instead it would be up to the framework to figure out how they are encoded, Capybara has stripped off all encodings. However, since rack-test is trying to escape the params it gets confused by a string that is seemingly encoded incorrectly.\n\nI'm not sure that rack-test is doing something wrong here, though it seems that using the UTF-8 regexp is just asking for trouble honestly, what if someone sends in a string with a _completely_ different encoding, surely that would break stuff?\n\nIs Capybara doing the rick thing? Is rack-test?

Since it operates at the byte level, the output depends on both the text and the encoding. Ruby strings conveniently carry their encoding along with them, so the natural interface for the URL-encoding function in Ruby is to take a single string parameter. But it does need to know the encoding in order for it to do its job correctly; we can't go stripping the encoding off beforehand (which is what forcing a binary encoding is essentially doing).\n\nIt's true that the original encoding can't be reconstructed solely from the URL-encoded bytes sent over the wire. The server needs to know what the original encoding was somehow. Typically it uses the charset from the request's content-type header, or it might assume a fixed encoding in situations where that's reasonable (e.g. if it serves all the forms with accept-charset=utf-8 [modulo browser bugs that the Rails \"snowman\" is meant to solve]).\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/981379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jfirebaugh","id":98601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh","html_url":"https://github.com/jfirebaugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/981450","html_url":"https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/243#issuecomment-981450","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/243","id":981450,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk4MTQ1MA==","user":{"login":"jfirebaugh","id":98601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh","html_url":"https://github.com/jfirebaugh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfirebaugh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-04-10T23:14:56Z","updated_at":"2011-04-10T23:14:56Z","body":"Here's
