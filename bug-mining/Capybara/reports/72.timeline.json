Most of the time my specs run perfectly.\n\nMy environment:\n\n```\n   phantomjs -v: 1.5.0\n   ruby 1.9.3p194 (2012-04-20 revision 35410) [x86_64-linux]\n   poltergeist: git version, :ref => \"0db1eb97677977922636e937c0e5c14d1a83df7c\"\n   ubuntu 12.04 \n   kernel 3.2.0-24 \n```\n\nI also experience some really weird results when running my specs. Sometimes rake spec will simply freeze and i have to ctrl-c it to death, assuming phantomjs did crash. Maybe this information is related. \n\nAny ideas what could be possibly happening here? Any information i can provide to help investigate it? \n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teampoltergeist/poltergeist/issues/76/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teampoltergeist/poltergeist/issues/76/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":41463610,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQxNDYzNjEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/events/41463610","actor":null,"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1b316b70ab0f013b5e99b1204bfbb1d3d79943fd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/commits/1b316b70ab0f013b5e99b1204bfbb1d3d79943fd","created_at":"2013-03-14T09:04:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/14892418","html_url":"https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1009#issuecomment-14892418","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1009","id":14892418,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0ODkyNDE4","user":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-03-14T09:06:40Z","updated_at":"2013-03-14T09:06:40Z","body":"Just pushed a possible fix, can you try it out and see if it helps you at all?\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/14892418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/14916029","html_url":"https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1009#issuecomment-14916029","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1009","id":14916029,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0OTE2MDI5","user":{"login":"DimaSamodurov","id":34840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaSamodurov","html_url":"https://github.com/DimaSamodurov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaSamodurov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaSamodurov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaSamodurov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaSamodurov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaSamodurov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaSamodurov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaSamodurov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaSamodurov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DimaSamodurov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-03-14T17:20:28Z","updated_at":"2013-03-14T17:20:28Z","body":"Great commit!
