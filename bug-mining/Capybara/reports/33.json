To do this I am using `Rack::StreamingProxy` to create a Rack app which acts as a proxy to the remote server.\n\nI ran into some trouble with cookies not being set correctly, which turned out to be fixed by giving the `Rack::MockSession` an explicit default host, taken from `Capybara.app_host`. This can be done by overriding [this method](https://github.com/brynary/rack-test/blob/master/lib/rack/test/methods.rb#L30) like so:\n\n``` ruby\nclass Capybara::RackTest::Browser\n  def build_rack_mock_session\n    Rack::MockSession.new(app, URI.parse(Capybara.app_host).host)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nSo, I realise this is a super-edge use case, but perhaps it would be worth defining that method in Capybara?\n\nThanks,\nJon\n","closed_by":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/344/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
