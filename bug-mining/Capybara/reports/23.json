I saw that error message at the first scenario, but all other scenarios told me, that :url is an unknown key.\nI made some research, and this issue is because at selenium_driver.rb line 86 browser key is deleted from options. If Selenium::WebDriver.for() gives back nil for a reason (in my case, remote url was not reachable), next time Selenium::WebDriver creates a firefox browser because at that point, options[:browser] is deleted, and default :firefox value is used.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/200/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/200/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
