this issue. I have two proposals to fix this issue done on my fork. The first would be as twalpole mentioned above and add browser_initialized? to the driver base and have it return true by default:\nhttps://github.com/sbonebrake/capybara/commit/5665396fc99fe73340e88998ffa7a4d2eda6ffa2\n\nThe second way, which I prefer, is to push the call to \"assert_no_selector\" down into the driver's reset method itself.\nhttps://github.com/sbonebrake/capybara/commit/15d4534428291841a073eea888ae4975b6d898e9\nI think this makes more sense because we are trusting the driver to assert the reset! is successful rather than having the session have to check on it.  The downside to this approach is that it technically isn't backwards compatible and any other drivers that extend would have to implement the call to assert_no_selector.\n\nLet me know if either of these are acceptable and i'll submit a proper pull

suppose another advantage of the first solution is that browser_initialized? could possibly be used in other methods.\nHowever, I feel that session.reset! always asserting_no_selector after reset! is taking a little bit of freedom away from the driver because the each driver may have its own definition of what it means to verify that the reset! is complete.  This thinking made me think of a 3rd solution where the drivers had the method \"assert_reset_complete\", but then I figured that responsibility should just be in the driver's reset! method because that's probably the only place it would be
