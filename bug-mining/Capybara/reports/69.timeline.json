This baby belongs to @jnicklas, so he gets to set the rules. :)\n\nUsing bundler as an example, I rather like how it handles the `bundle viz` command. It detects if the necessary gem is available and uses it if it is, or displays a message if it is not. The conditional code around whether selenium-web is available or not is easy to write, simple to understand, and pretty standard practice for ruby gems.\n\nWhen someone upgrades to the new capybara-without-selenium-web, who is using selenium-web, they see a message to include one line in their Gemfile. Once done, they never think about it again. If they're not using selenium-web, then they would already have the driver they depend on in the Gemfile.\n\nThis approach would meet all requirements but 4.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/13592693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"christiannelson","id":156139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjEzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiannelson","html_url":"https://github.com/christiannelson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiannelson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiannelson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiannelson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiannelson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiannelson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiannelson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiannelson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiannelson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/christiannelson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":37956202,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzc5NTYyMDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/events/37956202","actor":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-02-15T04:45:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":37956203,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3OTU2MjAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/events/37956203","actor":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-02-15T04:45:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/13891524","html_url":"https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/887#issuecomment-13891524","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/887","id":13891524,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODkxNTI0","user":{"login":"morgoth","id":10766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morgoth","html_url":"https://github.com/morgoth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morgoth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morgoth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morgoth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morgoth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morgoth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morgoth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morgoth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morgoth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morgoth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-21T14:37:03Z","updated_at":"2013-02-21T14:37
