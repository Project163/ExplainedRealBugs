I was experiencing intermittent freezing with the latest(capybara v2.1.0 and capybara-webkit(v1.0.0), and this workaround works for me.  The curious bit is that it only works if line 19 of workaround.rb is included.  Commented out, it freezes.  As well, I do not experience freezing if that line is converted to a Rails.logger.debug line.  So, it seems that some sort of IO or delay is allowing the synchronization to work.  In fact, putting in an extra sleep 0.05 at line 19 instead of a puts or Rails.logger.debug also prevents the freezing.
