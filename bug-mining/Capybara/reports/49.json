Basically I'm trying to test how my dependent combo boxes behave based on how their contents change after AJAX updates.\n\n``` ruby\n      nested_fields = page.all(\"div.fields\")\n      nested_fields.each_with_index do |fieldset,idx|\n      ...\n        field = fieldset.find_by_id(drop_down)\n      ...\n          fieldset.has_xpath?(\".//select[@id='#{drop_down}' and @disabled]\")\n         ...\n          field = fieldset.find_by_id(drop_down)\n\n```\n\nThis second call to `find_by_id` raises ElementNotFound, even if I pass the same ID string and `fieldset` is the same node (even the same ruby object).\nI have some other code executing where the ellipses are, but I'm pretty sure `find_by_id` stops working after this specific call to `has_xpath?`.\n\nSome notes:\n1) If I replace `fieldset` with `page`, everything works\n2) I haven't spent much time debugging this, but I think this has something to do with search scopes. I found out that when `find_by_id` errors out, Selenium driver receives a different parent element to execute `findElements` on. The ID of the parent in this case seems to be the last one found by `has_xpath?`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/713/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
