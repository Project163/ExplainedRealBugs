The original webrat cucumber tests solve this problem by doing something like this:\n\n`html.inner_text.gsub(/\\s+/, ' ').include?(\"Keith is writing a bug report\"\")`\n\nWhere are the capybara cucumber steps use XPath - which from what I can see - screw up when there is a new line.\n\nI've solved it by doing this:\n\n```\nmodule Capybara\n  class Session\n\n    # The Capybara definition of has_content uses XPath, which works for\n    # the most part, but it falls over when the content you are testing\n    # has a line break in it.
