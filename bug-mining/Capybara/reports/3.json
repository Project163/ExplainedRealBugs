This means you can't use default_selector until a session has already been created, which doesn't really make sense.\n\nI would have fixed this myself, but I'm not sure what approach you'd prefer. I can always require 'capybara/session' specifically myself in the high level code, although that feels wrong. It could be included in capybara/dsl or capybara/rails, or you could switch the autoload itself to a require.\n\nHowever it's fixed, I hope you agree that it doesn't make much sense to need a session to have been created before setting a default_selector...\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
