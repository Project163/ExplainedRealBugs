been sleuthing how simple rails projects with only a few explicit dependencies end up including many others (transitively) that in some cases aren't being used at all. This bloat is fuel for rails critics and wastes cycles each time Bundle.require is invoked.\n\nWe have been using capybara for years on possibly as many as 20 projects, and as far as I know we haven't used it with a selenium driver for at least 2 years. I have to believe we're not the only ones who always pair capybara with something else (e.g. headless-webkit or poltergeist). However, we end up dragging selenium-webkit (and libwebsocket, websocket, and rubyzip) along with us on every project.\n\nWould you consider removing the dependency on selenium-webdriver and leaving that to the user to include, since they know which driver they want to use? Including rack-test provides an out of the box experience (without js support). I can imagine capybara throwing a warning/error if js is required and no driver is set.\n\nIf you think this is a bad idea, I would love to understand why.

master has a new `has_text?` matcher which excludes invisible content such as `<title>` elements and `display: none` elements.\n\nIts implementation uses the `Node#text` method, so the implication is that the behaviour of `Node#text` has now changed from returning all text to only returning visible text. This presents two problems:\n- Users will have trouble upgrading if they are using `Node#text` directly, or `has_content?` (which is now just an alias of `has_text?`)\n- There is no API for getting e.g. the text of the `<title>` element. This could be a valid user requirement and was previously supported by the `#text` method.\n\nI propose adding a `#visible_text` method and using that to implement `has_text?`, leaving the implementations of `#text` and `#has_content?` as they are in 1.1. (`#has_content?` can be deprecated but I believe `#text` remains useful for checking e.g. `<title>` text.)
