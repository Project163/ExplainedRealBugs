A server that is slow to respond to HTTP requests would not trigger the boot timeout. All we really seem to be waiting for within the timeout window is for Thin or WEBrick to come up.\n\nIt's not clear to me at this point that this was ever a useful option. Should we perhaps remove it for Capybara 2.0? If it comes up for anyone, we can re-add it in 2.x, this time with proper tests to show why it's needed.\n","closed_by":{"login":"joliss","id":524783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDc4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/524783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss","html_url":"https://github.com/joliss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joliss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/589/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
