The exception from the driver generally contains information which is actually useful in figuring out why the element wasn't located, but Capybara throws this away and returns its own wholly uninformative message and a Capybara::ElementNotFound error. \n\nThis behavior makes debugging much more difficult, and the ensure block should not exist. The Capybara::ElementNotFound exception should only be raised if no elements are returned from #all - if the driver raises some other exception, that should not be caught by #find. \n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/190/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
