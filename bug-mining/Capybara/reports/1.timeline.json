master has a new `has_text?` matcher which excludes invisible content such as `<title>` elements and `display: none` elements.\n\nIts implementation uses the `Node#text` method, so the implication is that the behaviour of `Node#text` has now changed from returning all text to only returning visible text. This presents two problems:\n- Users will have trouble upgrading if they are using `Node#text` directly, or `has_content?` (which is now just an alias of `has_text?`)\n- There is no API for getting e.g. the text of the `<title>` element. This could be a valid user requirement and was previously supported by the `#text` method.\n\nI propose adding a `#visible_text` method and using that to implement `has_text?`, leaving the implementations of `#text` and `#has_content?` as they are in 1.1. (`#has_content?` can be deprecated but I believe `#text` remains useful for checking e.g. `<title>` text.)

`have_selector`, `have_text` and `have_title` do substring matching when string is passed to them.\n\nBut if element's text is not too long it's often more useful to do full string matching.\n\nCurrently synchronized full text matching can be done only using regexps:\n\n``` ruby\nhave_selector('#id', text: /\\A#{Regexp.escape('some text.')}\\Z/)\nhave_text(/\\A#{Regexp.escape('some text.')}\\Z/)\nhave_title(/\\A#{Regexp.escape('some text.')}\\Z/)\n```\n\nBut IMO it looks awful. I think Capybara should do a better job here and provide a way to do a full text matching more nicely.\n\nI'd like to propose some ways how API may look like and I would like to hear your opinion on this.\n\nHere is what I can propose:\n\n``` ruby\n#1\nhave_selector('#id', full_text: 'some text.')\n\n#2a\nhave_full_title('some text.')\n#2b\nhave_title(:full, 'some text.')\n#2c\nhave_title(full: 'some text.')\n\n#3a\nhave_full_text(:all, 'some text.')\n#3b\nhave_text(:all, :full, 'some text.')\n#3c\nhave_text(:all, full: 'some text.'))\n```\n#1 + #2a + #3a looks quiet good. But in that case we will have to add methods 10 methods:\n\n`has_full_text?`, `has_no_full_text?`, `have_full_text`, `assert_full_text`, `assert_no_full_text`, `has_full_title?`, `has_no_full_title?`, `have_full_title`, `assert_full_title`, `assert_no_full_title`. IMO it's too much given that there are other ways.\n\nIMO #3b doesn't look good.\n\nI like #1 + #2c + #3c the most. The only issue with this is that it doesn't fit into the general idea of locator that carries out the main role in searching + options that clarify it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1256/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ChinmayaTelstra","id":4627031,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjcwMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4627031?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmayaTelstra","html_url":"https://github.com/ChinmayaTelstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmayaTelstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmayaTelstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmayaTelstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmayaTelstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmayaTelstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmayaTelstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmayaTelstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmayaTelstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChinmayaTelstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-17T09:11:09Z","updated_at":"2015-06-17T09:11:09Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1537","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1537/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1537/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1537/events","html_url":"https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1537","id":88963267,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4ODk2MzI2Nw==","number":1537,"title":"Unable
