But the line after this is:\n\n```\nrescue Timeout::Error\n```\n\nWhich fails to catch the error. Simple fix: change Timeout::Error to TimeoutError and Capybara will correctly report that it's not getting an answer from the server.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
