had trouble figuring out how to best test this outside of Rails, but this is my issue in a Rails 3.2.3, Rspec, Capybara (rack-test), Turnip setup.\n\nIf I have the following HTML:\n\n```\n<label>Day <select name=\"day\">\n  <option value=\"1\">1</option>\n  <option value=\"2\">2</option>\n  ...\n  <option value=\"9\">9</option>\n  <option value=\"10\">10</option>\n  ...\n  <option value=\"30\">30</option>\n  <option value=\"31\">31</option>\n</select></label>\n```\n\nThis step:\n\n```\nselect n.to_s, from: 'Day'\n```\n\nworks as expected when `n >= 10` and fails when `n < 10` with the error:\n\n```\nCapybara::ElementNotFound:\nno option with text '4' in the select box\n```\n\nIf I replace the step with:\n\n```\nfind('select[name=\"date\"]').all('option').each_with_index do |option, i|\n  puts option.value == (i + 1).to_s\nend\n```\n\nIt spits out a bunch of `true`s (as I would expect).\n\nIf I have the following HTML:\n\n```\n<label>Day <select name=\"day\">\n  <option value=\"a\">a</option>\n  <option value=\"b\">b</option>\n  ...\n  <option value=\"y\">y</option>\n  <option value=\"z\">z</option>\n</select></label>\n```\n\nThen the step works as expected with (`n` any of the characters).\n\nIf I have the following HTML:\n\n```\n<label>Day <select name=\"day\">\n  <option value=\"01\">01</option>\n  <option value=\"02\">02</option>\n  ...\n  <option value=\"09\">09</option>\n  <option value=\"10\">10</option>\n  ...\n  <option value=\"30\">30</option>\n  <option value=\"31\">31</option>\n</select></label>\n```\n\nThen the step works as expected (with `n` the result of a `date.strftime('%d')`).\n\nIf someone could point my in a better direction with regards to testing outside of Rails, I'll see if I can better locate the issue behind my problem.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/681/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
