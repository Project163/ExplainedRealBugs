This bloat is fuel for rails critics and wastes cycles each time Bundle.require is invoked.\n\nWe have been using capybara for years on possibly as many as 20 projects, and as far as I know we haven't used it with a selenium driver for at least 2 years. I have to believe we're not the only ones who always pair capybara with something else (e.g. headless-webkit or poltergeist). However, we end up dragging selenium-webkit (and libwebsocket, websocket, and rubyzip) along with us on every project.\n\nWould you consider removing the dependency on selenium-webdriver and leaving that to the user to include, since they know which driver they want to use? Including rack-test provides an out of the box experience (without js support). I can imagine capybara throwing a warning/error if js is required and no driver is set.\n\nIf you think this is a bad idea, I would love to understand why.
