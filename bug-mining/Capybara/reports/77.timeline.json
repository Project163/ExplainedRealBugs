I did a few little tests to compare browser behavior to rack-test\n\nIf the \\n immediately following the textarea is in the original document and the form is submitted without changing the textarea contents then current behavior is the following\nRackTest : submits the leading \\n\nFF via Selenium : ignores the leading \\n (and a final \\n if there is one) and all remaining \\n are returned as \\r\\n\n\nHowever if we set the content of the textarea to something with a leading \\n then FF will not ignore that leading \\n (or a final \\n) and will return those converted to \\r\\n s\n\nJust changing the params function to gsub out leading \\n would potentially interfere with any changed values,\nso we have to be careful that any changes dont strip the \\n values that get set into the textarea during running.  There is also the question of whether we should be converting all \\n to \\r\\n when the form is submitted as browsers do.  @jnicklas I've done some work on a fix for this, would be interested on your
