Sometimes the browser just hangs for a while and a weird error is raised:\n\n<pre>\n  Connection reset by peer (Errno::ECONNRESET)\n  /usr/lib/ruby/1.8/net/protocol.rb:135:in `sysread'\n  ...\n</pre>\n\n\nWhen WaitUntil#timeout method is called it enters in a loop and it keeps running the given block, which have calls to Selenium::WebDriver API, which in turn communicates with the browser using HTTP requests. It appears that doing these requests too often causes this.\n\nI've managed to fix this by defining a wait_until method in Capybara::Driver::Selenium, which sleeps for a little while. This way we give some time for the next attempt to execute the block, which is what we generally want (for exemple, when waiting for ajax calls to finish). Here is the method:\n\n<pre>\n  def wait_until(*args)\n    sleep(0.05)\n  end\n</pre>\n\n\nI've tried to put lower values but anything lower than 0.03 still resulted in the above error. I think that 50ms is enough, though.\n\nHope this helps!\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/222471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vicentemundim","id":32839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentemundim","html_url":"https://github.com/vicentemundim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentemundim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentemundim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentemundim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentemundim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentemundim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentemundim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentemundim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentemundim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicentemundim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/222742","html_url":"https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/44#issuecomment-222742","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/44","id":222742,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjc0Mg==","user":{"login":"cmdrkeene","id":22959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdrkeene","html_url":"https://github.com/cmdrkeene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdrkeene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdrkeene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdrkeene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdrkeene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdrkeene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdrkeene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdrkeene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdrkeene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmdrkeene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-04-27T23:31:24Z","updated_at":"2010-04-27T23:31:24Z","body":"This
