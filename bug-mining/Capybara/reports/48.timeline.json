Sorry I can't be more specific, I don't work on the app anymore so can't check. Neither do I remember the exact value we used.

Or maybe removing the timeout completely and let Capybara wait until the app boots up, no matter how long it takes? In case it gets stuck, the user can always hit Ctrl-C or something.
