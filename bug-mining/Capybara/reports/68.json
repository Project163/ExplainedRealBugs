I was a bit surprised to find that this does not fail in the case that the element does exist, but is visible.\n\nIt looks like changing this line in lib/capybara/query#matches_filters? from:\n\n``` ruby\nreturn false if options[:visible] and not node.visible?\n```\n\nto:\n\n``` ruby\nreturn false if options.keys.include?(:visible) and node.visible? != options[:visible]\n```\n\nAnd changing this line in lib/capybara/query#initialize from:\n\n``` ruby\nunless options.has_key?(:visible)\n  @options[:visible] = Capybara.ignore_hidden_elements\nend\n```\n\nto:\n\n``` ruby\nif !options.has_key?(:visible) and !Capybara.ignore_hidden_elements.nil?\n  @options[:visible] = Capybara.ignore_hidden_elements\nend\n```\n\nalong with adding the following to spec_helper.rb\n\n``` ruby\nCapybara.ignore_hidden_elements = nil\n```\n\nwould allow me to produce the behavior I was expecting.\n\nIntuitively, I expect\n\n``` ruby\nhave_css('.class')\n```\n\nto be true regardless of visibility,\n\n``` ruby\nhave_css('.class', :visible => true)\n```\n\nto only pass if the element is on the page and visible, and\n\n``` ruby\nhave_css('.class', :visible => false)\n```\n\nto only pass if the element is on the page and not visible.\n\nI have not bothered writing a test, etc., as I wanted to at least ping someone to see if this is desired behavior. Even with the proposed patch, it doesn't seem like a user should have to set a configuration value to nil for something that feels like it should be default behavior. I'm curious what other people think.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/944/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/944/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
