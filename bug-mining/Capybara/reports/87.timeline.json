did some more research into this issue and I'm pretty convinced it's a Chrome/ChromeDriver issue. May be this same issue open on the chromedriver project: https://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=252. I get very similar output to @gigiJackson in my chromedriver output. One thing that's different for me though, I can only reproduce this issue semi-consistently when navigating to about:blank, which Capybara does from the `reset_sessions!` call it makes after each test (from capybara/rspec.rb).\nWe have two integration test suites, one which includes capybara/rspec.rb and one which doesn't. The one that doesn't never seems to have this issue, the other has it a lot.\nAlso this may or may not be a performance issue, as we see this issue happen a lot more often on a MacBook Air than on a MacBook Pro.\nI'm going to try continuing researching this, but a workaround may be to not include capybara/rspec.rb if it's timing out for you in the `reset_sessions!` code

08-21T02:22:51Z","body":"I can reproduce this very consistently with the following steps. I'm curious if it's not just me. First start up a rails console. Then run this setup line:\n`require 'capybara/dsl'; Capybara.register_driver(:selenium) { |app| Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, :browser => :chrome, :service_log_path => 'chromedriver.log') }; Capybara.default_driver = :selenium; include Capybara::DSL`\nThen run:\n`10.times { |i| puts i;visit 'http://google.com';visit 'http://example.com'}`\nIt always gets through the 10 iterations successfully.\nNext run:\n`10.times { |i| puts i;visit 'http://google.com';visit 'about:blank'}`\nFor me that never reaches past 3 or so without hanging, and then a Timeout::Error after 60 seconds. In chromedriver.log I see that it hangs when loading about:blank with the text 'waiting for pending navigations...'. If I go to the hung browser and click on the address bar and press enter (within 60 seconds of it hanging) it unhangs it, but only until the next iteration.\n\nThis is with Chrome version 28.0.1500.95 and chromedriver 2.1.\n\nInterestingly enough, if I run:\n`10.times { |i| puts i;visit 'http://example.com';visit 'about:blank'}`\nIt always succeeds. The main difference I can think is that http://google.com does a redirect but http://example.com doesn't. That may or may not be related to this issue.\n\nAgain this seems like a Chrome/chromedriver bug, but like I mentioned in my last comment a workaround is to not let Capybara run `reset_sessions!`. This is actually more complicated than not requiring 'capybara/rspec' as I implied in the previous comment. The way I got around it is to keep the require for 'capybara/rspec' in spec_helper.rb but right after it add:\n\n```\nmodule ::Capybara\n  def self.reset_sessions!\n  end\nend\n```\n\nI realize this is super hacky, and it might not work for everyone if you're relying on cookies getting cleared or it navigating to about:blank in between tests.\n\nI'll continue to investigate this when I have more time. Any other help would be greatly appreciated.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/22991466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lyahdav","id":359157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTE1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/359157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyahdav","html_url":"https://github.com/lyahdav","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyahdav/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyahdav/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyahdav/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyahdav/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyahdav/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyahdav/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyahdav/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyahdav/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyahdav/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/23339652","html_url":"https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1035#issuecomment-23339652","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1035","id":23339652,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMzM5NjUy","user":{"login":"andrew-david-smith","id":1277680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzc2ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1277680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-david-smith","html_url":"https://github.com/andrew-david-smith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-david-smith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-david-smith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-david-smith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-david-smith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-david-smith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-david-smith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-david-smith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-david-smith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrew-david-smith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-27T14:16:53Z","updated_at":"2013-08-27T14:16:53Z","body":"Yeah I get Net::ReadTimeout errors with chromedriver v2.2 and Chrome 29.\n\nIt wont fail all of the time, but it rarely manages to get past two scenarios inside a cucumber feature.\n\nlyahdav's hacky solution works for me, and will be what I use for the moment.

Finally I found a workaround fix by observing the chromedriver logs showing that the network call to tell chromedriver to navigate to \"about:blank\" was never returning. (My google-fu was weak yesterday, only found this thread today.)\n\nI patched the reset method (https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/blob/master/lib/capybara/selenium/driver.rb#L90) to navigate to 'about:help' instead and all works.\n\nI also noticed that the HEAD shutdown command was being ignored by chromedriver yesterday and I was accumulating Chrome instances, but this morning its working again. Its raining outside today, maybe that's the difference?\n\nI'll try chromedriver2 today if I can muster the will...\n\nOh yeah and if anyone else has as much difficulty enabling chromedriver logging as I did (trawling through the selenium source code finally to find out how), here you go:\n\n``` ruby\n    Capybara.register_driver :chrome do |app|\n          Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, :browser => :chrome,  :service_log_path => 'chromedriver.log')\n    end\n```\n\nThis is the only config you can pass to chromedriver as it stands (see https://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/chrome/bridge.rb#105) :crying_cat_face:  \n\nThis was 100% consistently failing on:\nmacbook pro retina 10.8.4, \nCapybara 2.1.0 (and now master)\nselenium-0.2.10\nselenium-webdriver-2.35.1\nchromedriver 2.3 (auto update broke old driver, so I moved to latest chromedriver via brew, not sure if there is a gem?)\nchrome 29.0.1547.65... and maybe i'll be turning that autoupdating off :poop: \n\nCheers\nKris\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/24301966/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kippr","id":366452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjQ1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kippr","html_url":"https://github.com/kippr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kippr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kippr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kippr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kippr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kippr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kippr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kippr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kippr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kippr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
