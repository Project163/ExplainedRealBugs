use:\n`.//a[./@href][(((./@id = '知 道' or normalize-space(string(.)) = '知 道') or ./@title = '知 道') or .//img[./@alt = '知 道'])]`,\nthe XPATH checker cannot find the element.\n\nI tried all the text link

5.1 (http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/single-page.html#space-character) defines two methods for normalizing spaces:\n- \"skip whitespace\" (that normalizes just 5 characters)\n- \"skip White_Space characters\" (that normalizes all Unicode spaces)\n\nOnly the first of those algorithms seems to be actually used in the spec.\n\nXML defines only 4 characters as one that should be normalized - http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-S\n\nSee https://gist.github.com/abotalov/19f6f07b2d9cc64f8a59 (HTML), https://gist.github.com/abotalov/df3630771e21bae504c8 (XML) for my evaluations.\n\nWhat should be changed? (please approve. I think it can be changed in 2.x as it's a bug)\n1. `Capybara::Selenium::Node#visible_text` shouldn't do space normalization as Webdriver already does it - https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/default/webdriver-spec.html#widl-WebElement-getElementText-DOMString)\n2. Algorithm of `normalize_whitespace` itself should be changed to do space normalization similarly to how getElementText does it. Some parts of getElementText's algorithm (e.g. processing CSS whitespace style) aren't worth to be checked so the algorithm will be somewhat different.\n\nInitially `normalize_whitespace` was made to handle so many space characters after https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara/issues/767. But it seems to me that this issue is entirely different (or code has changed too much as currently `normalize_whitespace` has nothing to do with `find_link`). Normalization for `find_link` happens in `xpath` gem and #767 is still not fixed and should be fixed there (this is an attempt - https://github.com/jnicklas/xpath/pull/63, however it's incorrect as it shouldn't treat several nbsp as one)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1353/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2563916235,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MjU2MzkxNjIzNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/events/2563916235","actor":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-17T11:14:01Z","lock_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
