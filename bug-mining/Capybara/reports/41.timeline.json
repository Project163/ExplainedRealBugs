I wonder if we could take that slightly further and emit a warning if respect_data_method is set to true.  Or be slightly clever and only warn if it's set to true yet rails.js is missing (not foolproof by any means I realise).\n\nActually, I've just had another thought.  Could we introduce a specific Rails 3 driver that knows about these special attributes?  I'm still not massively keen even on that idea because if someone uses that and doesn't have the stock rails.js file they're still not testing against a realistic environment.\n\nI've created a simple test to expose one side of the problem - where another rack app uses data-method in a way that's incompatible with the Rails 3 use[1]\n\n[1] https://github.com/chrisroos/capybara-data-method-naughtiness\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/520106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisroos","id":6556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroos","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisroos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisroos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/528768","html_url":"https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/184#issuecomment-528768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/184","id":528768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODc2OA==","user":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-11-09T13:09:11Z","updated_at":"2010-11-09T13:09:11Z","body":"Well, we already have a capybara/rails file, so we could set `:respect_data_method` to true, and leave it false when not in a Rails environment.
