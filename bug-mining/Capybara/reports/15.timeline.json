Some drivers may always return, while others won't. The solution with adding a return to the script works for Selenium, afaik it doesn't do anything on Celerity and we have _no idea_ how it would behave on hypothetical other drivers.\n\nImho the return statement does _not_ make sense from a JavaScript point of view. You are not executing a function. That is the only place where return is used in JavaScript. To have it used in this way does not make semantic sense to me, and is at best unexpected. Can you honestly say that your first instinct upon discovering that no value was returned would have been to add the return statement to the JavaScript? Mine definitely wouldn't have.\n\nAll of you are not surprised that the script returns a value, you are all surprised by the bug encountered in Selenium.
