initial proposal was that leaving `:visible` off (i.e. `have_css '.my-div'`) would return elements regardless of visibility. This would require changing the way `Capybara.ignore_hidden_elements` is used internally, but would result in the behavior I am advocating. Essentially, `Capybara.ignore_hidden_elements` would become a tri-state property, where nil does not set a default value for `:visible`.              \n\nGiven `Capybara.ignore_hidden_elements == nil`, you would get the following results:\n\n`have_css '.my-div'` would pass for an element that is either visible or hidden. As long as the element is on the page, it would pass.\n`have_css '.my-div', :visible => true` would fail if the element is hidden. If it is visible, it would pass.\n`have_css '.my-div', :visible => false` would fail if the element is visible. If it is hidden, it would pass.\n\nObviously, all cases fail in the case that the element is not on the page at all.\n\nSetting `Capybara.ignore_hidden_elements` to true would cause the `have_css '.my-div'` to only pass for visible elements, if you desire that behavior.\n\nWhat I have outlined here is not the current behavior, but seems like it should

my original suggestion, the user would not need to do that, as it would be the default (which is also the current behavior, so I am admittedly confused by the need for `:visible => false` to indicate 'include both visible and hidden elements'). My suggestion is that the `:visible` setting would simply be an indicator that the element is expected to be in the specified state (visible/hidden). If it is not in the specified state, the matcher would fail.\n\nI contend that the current options and behavior are misleading. Maybe a better solution is changing the allowed values for `:visible` to be `:visible`, `:hidden`, and `:any` (or `:all`) instead of trying to use boolean values. This would actually allow more explicit control, as the `:visible` and `:hidden` values would fail if the element is not in the expected state, whereas `:any`/`:all` would pass regardless of visibility.\n\nAt the end of the day, the current behavior allows no way to fail if you want to test that an element is hidden. I am open to other ways of fixing this, but definitely think it's worth finding a better way to handle. I believe I understand where you're coming from and would like to find a solution we can agree on.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/13226219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ToadJamb","id":488923,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODkyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/488923?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadJamb","html_url":"https://github.com/ToadJamb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadJamb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadJamb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadJamb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadJamb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadJamb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadJamb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadJamb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadJamb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ToadJamb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/13226737","html_url":"https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/944#issuecomment-13226737","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/944","id":13226737,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjI2NzM3","user":{"login":"abotalov","id":1497867,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTc4Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1497867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov","html_url":"https://github.com/abotalov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abotalov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-07T08:46:27Z","updated_at":"2013-02-07T08:46:27Z","body":"@jnicklas What about adding support for `:visible`, `:hidden`, `:any` as values for `:visible` instead of current `true` and `false`?

don't particularly like any of these solutions.\n\n@abotalov is right that we need an API that allows us to find elements _regardless_ of whether they are visible or not.
