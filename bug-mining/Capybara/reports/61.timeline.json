problem I'm having is similar to issue #771 only my buttons are not disabled but have behavior(form submission) bound to it via javascript.   \n\nMy tests are passing intermittently thus leading me to believe I'm hitting a race condition.  \n\nI'm thinking that capybara is clicking on the button and some of the time not all of the javascript  files have loaded(due to cpu and/or io conditions) and so I'm clicking on a button that isn't submitting the form and thus my test fails.  \n\nWhen I switch my driver to Selenium/chrome-webdriver, it seems to pass much more consistently, but still fails from time to time.  In fact, when it fails with selenium/chrome, I can see it try to click the button while the browser is still loading...\n\nSo the question is, does capybara wait until all asset files(js, css, img) are loaded before attempting to click on or interrogate the response?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/777/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/7552948","html_url":"https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/771#issuecomment-7552948","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/771","id":7552948,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NTI5NDg=","user":{"login":"badeball","id":730419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDQxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/badeball","html_url":"https://github.com/badeball","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badeball/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badeball/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badeball/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badeball/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badeball/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badeball/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badeball/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badeball/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/badeball/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-08-07T13:23:02Z","updated_at":"2012-08-07T20:22:53Z","body":"@synth, I'm not sure if your problem is related to this.

one is trickier. The first two commits (disabled buttons and an unrelated doc fix I made along the way) are easy. The third, which lets us raise an error if the locator is ambiguous, is more work.\n\nPart of it is the field tests. The example form view contained two scopes with \"First name\" and \"Last name\" fields, and a lot of tests that referred to them suddenly had errors. Rather than rewrite all those tests, I removed the second scope. Then I created a second form view, which _does_ have both scopes, just for the tests that actually _use_ scopes. I also wrote some new tests for the `AmbiguousField` error.\n\nThe rest of it is detailed in the commit message; I had to flag an ambiguous case that Capybara doesn't recognize.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wapcaplet/kelp/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wapcaplet/kelp/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/comments/11097640","html_url":"https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/771#issuecomment-11097640","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/771","id":11097640,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMDk3NjQw","user":{"login":"eostrom","id":8683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eostrom","html_url":"https://github.com/eostrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eostrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eostrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eostrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eostrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eostrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eostrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eostrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eostrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eostrom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-12-06T18:32:40Z","updated_at":"2012-12-06T18:32:40Z","body":"I agree that you never want to press a disabled button, but it can be useful to `find` one — you may actually want to verify that a button is present but not enabled.\n\nI don't personally have a use case for this right now, I just ran across it while updating Kelp.
