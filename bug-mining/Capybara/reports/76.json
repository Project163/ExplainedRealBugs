I am checking if there is \"install link\" in email.\n\nWhen I create cucumber test, I get unexpected result, when I send this form to server I can see that capybara cuts tags from textarea.\n\nIn file\nlib/capybara/rack_test/form.rb I found next code:\n\n``` ruby\n18    def params(button)\n...\n56      when 'textarea'\n57       merge_param!(params, field['name'].to_s, field.text.to_s)\n58      end\n```\n\nAs I understood field.text cuts all tags. It is posible to use field.inner_html instead, but I did not know if it will influence smth else.\n\nSo, can you suggest elegant way to fix this behaviour?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jnicklas","id":134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas","html_url":"https://github.com/jnicklas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnicklas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/teamcapybara/capybara/issues/1025/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
