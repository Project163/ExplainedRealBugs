In some cases however, I also need access to the element itself, to get at data attributes for instance. I could store the element in a local variable and reference it, but if #within would yield the element I could use a block variable and keep the within line nicely readable:\n\n``` ruby\nWhen /^I click on the first post's author's profile picture$/ do\n  within post_at_index(1) do |element|\n    @post = Post.find(element[:'data-post-id'])\n    @author = @post.author\n    click_link rel: :author\n  end\nend\n\ndef post_at_index(index)\n  find('.posts').find(:li, index)\nend\n```\n\nI tried changing this (in session.rb) and it seems to work:\n\n``` ruby\n    def within(*args)\n      new_scope = if args.first.is_a?(Capybara::Node::Base) then args.first else find(*args) end\n      begin\n        scopes.push(new_scope)\n        yield new_scope\n      ensure\n        scopes.pop\n      end\n    end\n```\n\nWould changing this make sense?
