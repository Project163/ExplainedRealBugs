While reviewing https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara#asynchronous-javascript-ajax-and-friends it wasn't 100% clear about which finder methods are AJAX-friendly. In the [documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/jnicklas/capybara/Capybara/Node/Finders:find) _only_ `find` is said to honor `default_wait_time`. Do any others? If not, it would probably be best to make this explicit in the README. I'd be happy to submit revision based on your guidance.
