 ### Proactive
 
-Unlike reactive strategies, proactive strategies do not focus on handling errors by the callbacks might throw or return. They can make pro-active decisions to cancel or reject the execution of callbacks.

-|[**Timeout**](#timeout)|Beyond a certain wait, a success result is unlikely.| *Don't wait forever*  |Guarantees the caller won't have to wait beyond the timeout. |
