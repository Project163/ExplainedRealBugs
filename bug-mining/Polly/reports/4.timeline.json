Proposal: Throttle policy\n## Purpose\n- To limit the number of concurrent parallel invocations through the policy.  \n- To isolate groups of actions (bulkhead isolation) such that the impact of faulting calls is isolated to the resource-pool to which it is limited, and other threads/pools/capacity remain to continue serving other calls.\n## Scope\n- A **non-exception handling** **resilience** strategy.\n- Support all sync and async variants\n- Support non-result-returning invocations (`Action`) and result-returning (`Func<TResult>`)\n- Support `Execute(...)` and `ExecuteAndCapture(...)` variants.  \n## Asynchronous forms\n#### Configuration syntax\n\n``` cssharp\nThrottlePolicy throttlePolicy = Policy\n  .ThrottleAsync(int maxParallelization[, int maxQueuedActions]);\n\nThrottlePolicy<TResult> throttlePolicy = Policy<TResult>\n  .ThrottleAsync(int maxParallelization[, int maxQueuedActions]);\n```\n#### Execution syntax\n\n```\n// TResult async form \nTResult result = throttlePolicy\n  .ExecuteAsync(Func<Task<CancellationToken, TResult>> executionFunc, CancellationToken token);\n\n// void async form\nthrottlePolicy\n  .ExecuteAsync(Func<CancellationToken, Task> executionFunc, CancellationToken token);\n```\n#### Implementation\n-  a pair of `SemaphoreSlim`s\n#### Operation\n- Attempt to acquire a semaphore limited to maxParallelization + maxQueuedActions with no delay.\n  - Throw `ThrottleQueueFullException : ExecutionRejectedException` if cannot acquire semaphore  immediately.\n- Attempt to acquire a semaphore limited to maxParallelization (**UPDATE**: timeout from any wrapping timeout policy can be automatically handled by the `CancellationToken` passed in)\n  - **EDIT** wait until can acquire semaphore (unless timed out)\n- (once semaphore acquired) Execute `executionFunc`\n- If `executionFunc` raises any kind of fault: rethrow / pass fault result to caller.  \n#### Implementation and Operation - Semaphore form\n- As for async.  \n- **EDIT**: Edited to remove `TaskScheduler`/`ThreadPool` proposal, which will not be taken forward for v5.0.\n## Naming\n\nPossible names could include `Throttle`, `ParallelThrottle`, `MaxConcurrency`, `Isolate`?  Typical (_but not the only_) usage is bulkhead isolation; the effective operation (the undisputable thing) is to limit parallelization to a maximum concurrency.\n# Comments?\n\nComments?  Alternative suggestions?  Extra considerations to bear in mind?  \n\nScenarios where you'd use this? (please share now - could inform development!)  \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/138/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
