However, I am using this same policy for many different Execute() functions.  I would like to perhaps be able to pass some data, maybe just a string that says what call this is - so when the log is written it can accurately record which operation is retrying.\n\nIs there a way to do this - if not, do you think it is a valuable addition to your library (perhaps as an optional parameter to the Execute() call - and then that parameter passed into the lambdas like timespan/retryattempt/exception is?\n","closed_by":{"login":"michael-wolfenden","id":780521,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MDUyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/780521?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-wolfenden","html_url":"https://github.com/michael-wolfenden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-wolfenden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-wolfenden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-wolfenden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-wolfenden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-wolfenden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-wolfenden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-wolfenden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-wolfenden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-wolfenden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
