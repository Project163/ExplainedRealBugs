feed so that I\ndon't have to distribute my own fork, etc. If you have any questions or you need\nthis cleaned up before integration please reply back.\n\nRegards, \nGeoff\n\nImplementation Notes:\n-

configuring a timeout for HttpClient with AddPolicyHandler, then using the HttpClient to download a file, the policy is ignored.\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n1) With a large download that normally takes n>100 seconds and setting a long timeout x>n seconds,  the download should succeed.\r\n2) With a smaller download that normally takes n<100 seconds, and setting a short timeout x<n seconds, the request should fail, throwing a Timeout or TaskCanceled exception after x seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:**\r\n1) The client throws a TaskCanceled exception after approx, 100

above.\r\n3 & 4 demonstrate how similar requests, using a config-based timeout, behave as expected. \r\n5 & 6 are sanity checks that demonstrate cases where policy-based timeouts do behave as expected \r\n\r\nOf course the actual download times may vary according to your internet speed, so you may have to download different sized files, and/or specify different timeout values in order to reproduce the problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/782/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Mahantesh-DotNet","id":66260047,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjYwMDQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66260047?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahantesh-DotNet","html_url":"https://github.com/Mahantesh-DotNet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahantesh-DotNet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahantesh-DotNet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahantesh-DotNet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahantesh-DotNet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahantesh-DotNet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahantesh-DotNet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahantesh-DotNet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahantesh-DotNet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mahantesh-DotNet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-08T11:07:04Z","updated_at":"2024-07-08T11:07:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2181","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2181/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2181/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2181/events","html_url":"https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2181","id":2392948727,"node_id":"I_kwDOAJaD5s6OoX_3","number":2181,"title":"[Question]:
