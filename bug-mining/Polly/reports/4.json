I'll be happy to send a PR but I have no idea what feature/project type my VS15 installation is missing, that I cannot load Polly.Shared projects. It tell me that `The imported project \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\WindowsXaml\\v14.0\\8.1\\Microsoft.Windows.UI.Xaml.CSharp.targets\" was not found.
