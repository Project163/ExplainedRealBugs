only its constituent policies do.  \r\n+ A PolicyWrap instance may comprise multiple constituent policies, each of which may (by design) handle different exceptions or results.\r\n\r\nIn that context, we need to define what it means to say a given exception or result was or was not handled by the `PolicyWrap`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## PROPOSAL\r\n\r\n`.ExecuteAndCapture(...)` on a `PolicyWrap` should indicate that a given exception or result was handled by the `PolicyWrap` if the outermost policy in the `PolicyWrap` handled it.","closed_by":{"login":"reisenberger","id":9608723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDg3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9608723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger","html_url":"https://github.com/reisenberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/267/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
