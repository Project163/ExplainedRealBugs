In principle, I can think of three distinct ways of doing so (arbitrary mixtures possible):\n\n1. Extract Copyright and license from Nuget package, then look up, possibly generic, license text from license URL or SPDX identifier.\n2. Figure out that Polly is hosted on github, and query github API / Repo to get the license text and copyright.\n3. Take the license text supplied with the Nuget package.\n\nThey all have drawbacks. Nuget package metadata is too often bad, so 1. can only be a first attempt. Variant 2 requires infrastructure (network connections, github tokens, ...) and has some edge cases, i.e., is mostly for standard tooling. Variant 3 does not give you metadata, and requires a license file with the package.\n\nFor the best coverage, I would augment my original proposal to use the copyright from the license file (supports the first approach), and ship the license with the Nuget package (supports the third use-case).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/comments/2805128295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ulfllorenz","id":68948878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTQ4ODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68948878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz","html_url":"https://github.com/ulfllorenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17270185752,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAJaD5s6x9Nv7zwAAAAQFYh8Y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/17270185752","actor":{"login":"martincostello","id":1439341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzkzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1439341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello","html_url":"https://github.com/martincostello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"54a33b9c10514d61933346952b447addebf03818","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/commits/54a33b9c10514d61933346952b447addebf03818","created_at":"2025-04-15T14:07:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17270187323,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAJaD5s6x9Nv7zwAAAAQFYiU7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/17270187323","actor":{"login":"martincostello","id":1439341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzkzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1439341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello","html_url":"https://github.com/martincostello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-15T14:07:07Z","milestone":{"title":"v8.5.3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"martincostello","id":1439341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzkzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1439341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello","html_url":"https://github.com/martincostello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at

You can get the license, but you need to parse/read it to determine how we're licensed. Alternatively you can query the GitHub API to get it and rely on GitHub parsing it and creating an appropriate SPDX. That doesn't _need_ an API token, other than to avoid rate-limiting.\n\n```pwsh\n❯ gh api https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly --jq '.license.spdx_id'\nBSD-3-Clause\n```\n\nIt's not possible to create a NuGet package that contains the `LICENSE` file _and_ declares an explicit SPDX ([NuGet Error NU5033](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/errors-and-warnings/nu5033)).\n\nI think I would prefer reverting the LICENSE change and sticking with the SPDX and we just keep the part that keeps the copyright text consistent.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/comments/2805404171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"martincostello","id":1439341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzkzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1439341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello","html_url":"https://github.com/martincostello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/comments/2806698103","html_url":"https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2579#issuecomment-2806698103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2579","id":2806698103,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAJaD5s6nStB3","user":{"login":"ulfllorenz","id":68948878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTQ4ODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68948878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz","html_url":"https://github.com/ulfllorenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-15T16:15:17Z","updated_at":"2025-04-15T16:16:32Z","body":"Yes, your proposal sucks. And I think that is one of the stupid bits about the Nuget package format that you cannot have an SPDX expression _and_ a license file. Instead you can have a license URL, which everyone points to generic https://license.nuget.org/MIT texts. leading to half-baked metadata... Anyway, no use in complaining.\n\nMy suggestion would be to keep the SPDX identifier and place the LICENSE file in the root of the Nuget package (something like an `<ItemGroup>` with `<None Include=\"..\\LICENSE\" Pack=\"true\" PackagePath=\"\\\" />` would do the trick. This is also what the DotNet Base packages do, for example System.Text.Json.\n\nEdit: Just to make it clear: The nuspec file / SBOM would not know about the license file, this is purely convention.

well.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/comments/2806698103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ulfllorenz","id":68948878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTQ4ODc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68948878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz","html_url":"https://github.com/ulfllorenz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulfllorenz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":17277255775,"node_id":"CE_lADOAJaD5s6x9Nv7zwAAAAQFzgBf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/17277255775","actor":{"login":"martincostello","id":1439341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzkzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1439341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello","html_url":"https://github.com/martincostello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-15T21:38:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17277255799,"node_id":"CE_lADOAJaD5s6x9Nv7zwAAAAQFzgB3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/17277255799","actor":{"login":"martincostello","id":1439341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzkzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1439341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello","html_url":"https://github.com/martincostello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"2e1f3afcd574675c5ead8792b592e2afad19d215","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/commits/2e1f3afcd574675c5ead8792b592e2afad19d215","created_at":"2025-04-15T21:38:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17280397689,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAJaD5s6x9Nv7zwAAAAQF_fF5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/17280397689","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.gith
