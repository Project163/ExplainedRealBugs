I just added the necessary attribute, and no issues were identified for Polly.dll in all the currently supported targets.\n\nAn issue was identified for xunit (`warning CS3016: Arrays as attribute arguments is not CLS-compliant`) on the `MemberData` attribute used for `Theory`s.  This is outside our control, but has no impact on the nuget packages: the tests don't form part of the nuget package.\n\nWe'll aim to get this attribute added for the v5.0 release.
