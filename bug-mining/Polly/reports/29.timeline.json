The current state\r\n\r\n### `OnRetry`\r\nThe `OnRetry` telemetry events are always reported as

handled attempt but before the next attempt. \r\n  - That means this event will not occur after the final attempt. \r\n- Also please bear in mind these events start with the `Resilience Event occurred ...` message\r\n\r\n### `ExecutionAttempt`\r\n\r\nThe `ExecutionAttempt` telemetry events are either reported as `Warning` or as `Information` whether the outcome is handled or not
