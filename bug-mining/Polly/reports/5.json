Because the Polly library at present does not distinguish the types, we cannot use `Policy` as a parameter type and have ended up having to create our own wrapper classes to distinguish.).\n\nDistinguishing `CircuitBreakerPolicy` and `RetryPolicy` types would also allow the introduction of functionality specific to only one type, eg #62\n","closed_by":{"login":"joelhulen","id":5950304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTAzMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen","html_url":"https://github.com/joelhulen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/63/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/63/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
