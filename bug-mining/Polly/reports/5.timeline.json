looks to me as if `ContextualPolicy` is only used for retry policies at present, but could conceivably be used for circuit-breaker policies too.  This could lead to an overall class structure (if desired) like:\n\n`RetryPolicy` : (abstract) `Policy`, `IRetryPolicy`\n`CircuitBreakerPolicy` : (abstract) `Policy`, `ICircuitBreakerPolicy`\n`RetryContextualPolicy` : (abstract) `ContextualPolicy`, `IRetryPolicy`\n`CircuitBreakerContextualPolicy` : (abstract) `ContextualPolicy`, `ICircuitBreakerPolicy` // although CircuitBreakerContextualPolicy isn't used yet, so might be better not to add yet. At the moment there are no callbacks possible from circuit-breaker policies, but if something like #52 were implemented (callbacks on circuit-breaker), then call-backs with added context might make sense.\n\n(and where `IRetryPolicy` and `ICircuitBreakerPolicy` are mostly marker interfaces)\n\nI notice also that there are also internal classes already named `CircuitBreakerPolicy` and `RetryPolicy`, which might want renaming, to avoid confusion in the codebase with the new intended public versions `CircuitBreakerPolicy` and `RetryPolicy`.\n\nI could code this all up and PR to demonstrate, if more useful.\n\n_NB ContextualPolicy is new to me and not one I've used, so welcome comment if anyone knows better, tho the above seems to make sense from reading the codebase and documentation_\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/comments/162242943/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"reisenberger","id":9608723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDg3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9608723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger","html_url":"https://github.com/reisenberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/comments/162254199","html_url":"https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/issues/63#issuecomment-162254199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/63","id":162254199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjI1NDE5OQ==","user":{"login":"joelhulen","id":5950304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTAzMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen","html_url":"https://github.com/joelhulen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-05T22:36:49Z","updated_at":"2015-12-05T22:36:49Z","body":"@reisenberger This is going to take a little bit of time to review, but I am following your logic and like what I see so far.

I think it would help as an example on the readme and/or samples project.\nMoreover I think I've found a gap in the API or rather something rather non-obvious that would be worth helping either via a new method/extension.\n\nIn particular we have a need to wrap Policy statements - a retryforever (that logs error) wrapping a retry and backoff (that logs warning). An extra complexity is that somethimes we want that behaviour and sometimes we want another policy. I know.\n\nSo our policy:\n\n```\nprivate Polly.Policy SetRetryPolicy(int retries, int retryWaitInMilliseconds, bool isFromApi)\n{\n    if (!isFromApi)\n    {   \n        return\n            Polly\n                .Policy\n                .Handle<Exception>()\n                .RetryForever(exception =>\n                {\n                    _log.ErrorFormat(\"An erros with Exception detail \" + exception);\n                })\n                .Execute(() =>\n                    Polly\n                        .Policy\n                        .Handle<Exception>()\n                        .WaitAndRetry(\n                            retries,\n                            retryAttempt => TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(retryWaitInMilliseconds*Math.Pow(2, retryAttempt)),\n                            (exception, timeSpan) =>\n                            {\n                                _log.WarnFormat(\"An erros with Exception detail \" + exception);\n                            }));\n    }\n    return\n        Polly\n            .Policy\n            .Handle<AggregateException>()\n            .Retry(retryWaitInMilliseconds, (exception, i) =>\n            {\n                _connectionSingleton.Stop();\n                _log.ErrorFormat(\"An erros with Exception detail \" + exception);\n            });\n}\n```\n\nThe issue I'd like to point attention to is I _was_ passing to the WaitAndRetry method above the following:\n\n```\n(exception, timeSpan, *context*) => ...\n```\n\n.... this has the effect of creating a ContextualPolicy, whereas the second Policy was a Polly.Policy. \n- There is no way to combine a ContextualPolicy and Policy\n- It's _very_ easy to miss this in amongst the various overloads.\n\nI love how Polly works but the lack of examples covering wrapping policies really stymied me. Any help / guidance for others could help.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/64/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/64/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":489834755,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50NDg5ODM0NzU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/489834755","actor":{"login":"reisenberger","id":9608723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDg3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9608723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger","html_url":"https://github.com/reisenberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-11T22:03:50Z","rename":{"from":"Create
