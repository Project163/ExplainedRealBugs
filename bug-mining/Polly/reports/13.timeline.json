Could you post also the code where you place the call through the `PolicyWrap`?  If you are able to combine all into a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) (even if just with a stub response method), that will also speed investigation.\r\n\r\nFor an immediate suggestion: test also with declaring the cache and retry policies as strongly-typed to `HttpResponseMessage`.  IE `var cachePolicy = Policy.CacheAsync<HttpResponseMessage>(...)`; `var retryPolicy = Policy<HttpResponseMessage>.Handle<HttpRequestException>(...)`\r\n\r\nAssuming that works, this may be an issue specific to [non-generic](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Non-generic-and-generic-policies) `CachePolicy` mid non-generic `PolicyWrap`.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/comments/341358517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"reisenberger","id":9608723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDg3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9608723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger","html_url":"https://github.com/reisenberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1322558021,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTMyMjU1ODAyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/1322558021","actor":{"login":"tdabasinskas","id":7723360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MjMzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7723360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdabasinskas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-02T09:05:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1322558022,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEzMjI1NTgwMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/1322558022","actor":{"login":"tdabasinskas","id":7723360,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MjMzNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7723360?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdabasinskas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdabasinskas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-02T09:05:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1322558754,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MTMyMjU1ODc1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/1322558754","actor":{"login":"reisenberger","id":9608723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDg3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9608723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger","html_url":"https://github.com/reisenberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null
