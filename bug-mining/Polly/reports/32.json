It's also not covered explicitly by anything on StackOverflow.\r\n\r\nAfter trial-and-error I realised:\r\n- for incoming requests: it allows for policies-per-users, e.g. partitioned by username, IP address, access token\r\n- for outgoing requests to external APIs: one would probably use a constant partition key, e.g. \"aws-sns-service\", \"azure-auth-service\"\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to add a small explanation in the docs because this was confusing. (I can't submit a PR as I'm still not certain my above understanding is correct).","closed_by":{"login":"martincostello","id":1439341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzkzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1439341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello","html_url":"https://github.com/martincostello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2343/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
