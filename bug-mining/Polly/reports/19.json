[README for the NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly/7.2.4#readme-body-tab) has a few broken bits of HTML due to CSP restrictions and HTML rendering differences compared to when

Change the README to be compatible with rendering in NuGet.org;\r\n2. Create a separate README that's more bare-bones and links back to the main repo README.\r\n\r\nI think option 2 is better as it doesn't send us down the path of the lowest common denominator.\r\n\r\nOther thoughts?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"martincostello","id":1439341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzkzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1439341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello","html_url":"https://github.com/martincostello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/1293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/1293/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
