Describe the bug\n\nProbably a silly \"bug\" ticket to open, but since version 8.x of Polly, the new and existing packages have `Package Description` in their description metadata property.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe packages have a message that describes what the package does.\r\nThe v7 package of Polly, for example, had the following text: `Polly is a library that allows developers to express resilience and transient fault handling policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback in a fluent and thread-safe manner.`\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nPackage description is `Package Description`\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCompare https://nuget.info/packages/Polly/7.2.4 vs https://nuget.info/packages/Polly/8.0.0\n\n### Exception(s) (if any)\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Polly version\n\n8.0.0 and higher\n\n### .NET Version\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Anything else?\n\n_No
