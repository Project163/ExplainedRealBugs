Migration Guide (migration-v8.md)\r\nReplaced example that passed a throwing callback with the safe pattern: wrapping the MethodAsync call in try/catch and returning either Outcome.FromResult(...) or Outcome.FromException<T>(...).\r\n\r\n  2. Fallback Strategy (fallback.md)\r\nUpdated the “✅ DO” snippet to wrap user code in try/catch and properly return Outcome<T>, enabling exception remapping logic without throwing from the callback.\r\n\r\n  3. Circuit Breaker Strategy (circuit-breaker.md)\r\nRewrote the “✅ DO” example to include exception capture via Outcome<T>, and updated post-execution logic to correctly handle both BrokenCircuitException and other errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n - XML documentation updates. Strengthened the <remarks> section on ExecuteOutcomeAsync<TResult, TState> to emphasize that the callback must not throw; users must wrap their code and return an Outcome<TResult>. This clarifies the contract and prevents accidental misuse that relies on internal implementation details. Files affected:\r\n\r\n  1. ResiliencePipeline.AsyncT.cs\r\n  2. ResiliencePipelineT.Async.cs\r\n\r\n - Snippet corrections:\r\n\r\n1. Migration.Execute.cs (snippets used in docs)\r\nUpdated the V8 example (SafeExecute_V8) to use the correct, safe callback pattern: wrapping in try/catch and returning an Outcome<T>. This ensures consistency across sample code and real documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Confirm the following\r\n\r\n- [x]  I started this PR by branching from the head of the default branch\r\n- [x]  I have targeted the PR to merge into the default branch\r\n- [x]  I have included unit tests for the issue/feature\r\n- [x]  I have successfully run a local build\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2710/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19275633043,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAJaD5s7CMwopzwAAAAR86tGT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/19275633043","actor":{"login":"carvex21","id":53511601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTExNjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53511601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21","html_url":"https://github.com/carvex21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4e47068f09b031e400f7eeb8dae33d92bfcfcb43","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carvex21/Polly/commits/4e47068f09b031e400f7eeb8dae33d92bfcfcb43","created_at":"2025-08-21T22:09:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19275649094,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAJaD5s7CMwopzwAAAAR86xBG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/19275649094","actor":{"login":"carvex21","id":53511601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTExNjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53511601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21","html_url":"https://github.com/carvex21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f7a437e327788a19dcda1b2f3df64ea7f4cc5c3e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carvex21/Polly/commits/f7a437e327788a19dcda1b2f3df64ea7f4cc5c3e","created_at":"2025-08-21T22:10:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19276424678,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAJaD5s7CMwopzwAAAAR89uXm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/19276424678","actor":{"login":"carvex21","id":53511601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTExNjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53511601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21","html_url":"https://github.com/carvex21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"68b2fe0723543ede9ac2002f0633ede4df9750a3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carvex21/Polly/commits/68b2fe0723543ede9ac2002f0633ede4df9750a3","created_at":"2025-08-21T23:23:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19289087369,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAJaD5s7CMwopzwAAAAR9uB2J","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/19289087369","actor":{"login":"carvex21","id":53511601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTExNjAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53511601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21","html_url":"https://github.com/carvex21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carvex21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://a
