I'm not sure why specifically, other than an abundance of caution, but I've already seen examples of users asking questions to _other_ open source repositories using FluentAssertions regarding licensing implications etc. The \"easiest\" thing to do to avoid such questions ourselves would be to just not use it.\n\nA good candidate replacement for this is [Shouldly](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly), which I happen to already use as my assertion library of choice anyway.\n\nI already took at look at doing this yesterday, but it was a **big** change (mostly in Polly.Specs), so it's best done on a per-project basis (or smaller) scope to reduce the size of change as FluentAssertions is removed.\n\nThe most impactful difference between the two seems to be the use of the `Invoking()` extension method.","closed_by":{"login":"martincostello","id":1439341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzkzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1439341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello","html_url":"https://github.com/martincostello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2450/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
