treated directly as the `ResilienceContext` for the execution, but as the _state_ for the execution (which happens to be of type `ResilienceContext`) as it resolves to this overload:\n\nhttps://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/blob/995b0f11f2243911d7b8c920608e914d2bd54a3a/src/Polly.Core/ResiliencePipeline.Async.cs#L90-L93\n\nThis means that Polly internally retrieves a different `ResilienceContext` from the pool and passes it to your delegate, and because of this it doesn't contain your custom properties.\n\nYou should change your code as shown below:\n\n```diff\n- await pipeline.ExecuteAsync((context, token) => throw new Exception(), resilienceContext);\n+ await pipeline.ExecuteAsync((context) => throw new Exception(), resilienceContext);\n```\n\nThis will invoke this different overload, which gives the desired result as the `resilienceContext` will be used as the `ResilienceContext`, rather than the `state`:\n\nhttps://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/blob/995b0f11f2243911d7b8c920608e914d2bd54a3a/src/Polly.Core/ResiliencePipeline.Async.cs#L53-L55\n\nI'll see if there's a note we can add to the docs to
