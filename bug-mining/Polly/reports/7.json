There's some confusion when reading the wiki, which states this:\n\n\"The above example will create a circuit-breaker which would break after two _consecutive_ exceptions of the handled type\", however, if we have successes in between, we should never see the circuit trip (if I'm not mistaken).\n\n```\npublic override void OnActionSuccess(Context context)\n{\n    using (TimedLock.Lock(_lock))\n    {\n        if (_circuitState == CircuitState.HalfOpen) { OnCircuitReset(context); }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nShould become:\n\n```\npublic override void OnActionSuccess(Context context)\n{\n    using (TimedLock.Lock(_lock))\n    {\n        if (_circuitState == CircuitState.HalfOpen || _circuitState == CircuitState.Closed) { OnCircuitReset(context); }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nThanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"joelhulen","id":5950304,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTAzMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5950304?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen","html_url":"https://github.com/joelhulen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelhulen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/131/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
