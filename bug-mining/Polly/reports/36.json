Or an existing feature?\n\nI have been preparing a Software Bill of Materials for a Polly-consuming product, and I have a smaller issues with the current state of the Nuget packages (Polly and Polly.Core). While I would not consider them critical, they are as easy to fix as they are arcane, so I thought I'd raise this.\n\nRight now, the Nuget package provides a license expression (good), a licenseUrl (not so useful) and a copyright (misleading). My quibble is that the license in the repository is pretty clear: Consumers of Polly must provide the copyright _as found in the license file_. And this copyright differs from the one in the Nuget package. \n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nOne solution would be to provide the license file as it is in the repository in the Nuget file, that would make the package self-contained; the copyright in the Nuget metadata could be scrapped for the sake of having a single source of truth.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"martincostello","id":1439341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzkzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1439341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello","html_url":"https://github.com/martincostello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2579/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
