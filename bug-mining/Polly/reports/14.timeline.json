Declaring the policy explicitly as `FallbackPolicy policy` has declared a non-generic policy.  The compiler thus picks up this configuration overload: `.Fallback(Action fallbackAction)`\r\n\r\nThat this is not jumping out as a problem is in part caused by the fact that the compiler will silently accept assigning a `Func<int>` to an `Action`.  It's not an error - it's just as you could execute `DivideWithoutZero(3, 0);` as a statement, without doing anything with its return value - but there isn't any warning to you from the compiler that this is happening.\r\n\r\nInstead, you need to declare that the policy is explicitly for delegates returning `int`:\r\n\r\n`FallbackPolicy<int> policy = Policy<int>.Handle<DivideByZeroException>().Fallback(() => DivideWithoutZero(3, 0));`","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/comments/322054349/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"reisenberger","id":9608723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDg3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9608723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger","html_url":"https://github.com/reisenberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1205141517,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MTIwNTE0MTUxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/1205141517","actor":{"login":"reisenberger","id":9608723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDg3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9608723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger","html_url":"https://github.com/reisenberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-08-14T16:57:35Z","rename":{"from":"Result

Thanks for raising this.  Did the suggestion fix for you?\r\n\r\nI think we should fix this in Polly so that it's not possible to fall into the situation you encountered.  The combination is:\r\n\r\n(1) A plain (non-generic) `FallbackPolicy` configures an `Action fallbackAction` to run in case of fallback\r\n(2) All Polly non-Generic policies let you use a [generic execute _method_ `.Execute<TResult>(...)`](https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/wiki/Non-generic-and-generic-policies#non-generic-policies-policy). But a generic-`TResult` execution for a plain `FallbackPolicy` doesn't make sense, because the `Action fallbackAction` configured can only ever return `void`, so can never provide a substitute `TResult` value.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I think we should treat `FallbackPolicy` (non-generic) `.Execute<TResult>(...)` as an `InvalidOperationException`.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/comments/324155821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"reisenberger","id":9608723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDg3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9608723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger","html_url":"https://github.com/reisenberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1216751648,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTIxNjc1MTY0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/1216751648","actor":{"login":"jonnovaretti","id":615717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTcxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/615717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti","html_url":"https://github.com/jonnovaretti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-08-22T21:23:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1216751649,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEyMTY3NTE2NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/1216751649","actor":{"login":"jonnovaretti","id":615717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTcxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/615717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti","html_url":"https://github.com/jonnovaretti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonnovaretti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-08-22T21:23:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1283275882,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEyODMyNzU4ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/events/1283275882","actor":{"login":"reisenberger","id":9608723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDg3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9608723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger","html_url":"https://github.com/reisenberger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reisenberger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,
