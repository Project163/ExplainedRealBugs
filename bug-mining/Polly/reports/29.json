Or an existing feature?\n\nPolly reports `Resilience Event occurred ..` logs as Error, even when it's the first attempt that failed and multiple attempts will still be made.\r\n\r\nThis makes the log show up as an error, possibly setting off alerts even though it isn't really an error until the retry mechanisms have truly failed.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like to be able to configure failed retries to get logged as Warning. When the final attempt fails, that could then be logged as an error.\r\n\r\nThis means that I will only see _true_ errors (that might need investigation) in my error screen.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"martincostello","id":1439341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzkzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1439341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello","html_url":"https://github.com/martincostello","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/martincostello/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2162/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/App-vNext/Polly/issues/2162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
