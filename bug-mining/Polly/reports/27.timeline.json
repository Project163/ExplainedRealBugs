[Reading here](https://www.pollydocs.org/advanced/testing.html) it looks like you are suggested to make a mock.\r\n\r\nHere is a very rough draft how documentation could look like when using keyed services. It’s based on **Dependency injection** on [getting started](https://www.pollydocs.org/getting-started.html) page. Again, I do not understand what I’m doing, just playing around 😊. I assume there are some feature you would lose with this approach.\r\n\r\n# Dependency injection\r\nIf you prefer to define resilience pipelines using IServiceCollection, you'll need to install the Polly.Extensions package:\r\n\r\n```text\r\ndotnet add package Polly.Extensions\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen you can define your resilience pipeline as shown:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar services = new ServiceCollection();\r\n\r\nResiliencePipeline pipelineToAdd = new ResiliencePipelineBuilder()\r\n    .AddRetry(new RetryStrategyOptions())\r\n    .AddTimeout(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10))\r\n

`AddResiliencePipeline` is called, we can also register a keyed singleton `ResiliencePipeline`. \r\n\r\nThen, the following should work:\r\n\r\n```

services:\r\n\r\n- [Deferred pipelines](https://www.pollydocs.org/advanced/dependency-injection.html#deferred-addition-of-pipelines) won't be registered as keyed singletons because we don't know what pipelines are being added at registration time. \r\n- [Complex pipeline keys](https://www.pollydocs.org/advanced/dependency-injection.html#complex-pipeline-keys) won't be supported. This is because the complex key is provided at access time and we can only register single keyed singleton for such key.
