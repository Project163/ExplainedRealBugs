Description, motivation, context\r\nOn a newly initialized git repo, there are no branches created until a\r\ncommit is made. Previously, starship handled this by hardcoding a default\r\nvalue \"master\" for when branch `head` could not be read.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a user wants to set a different default branch name, that\r\nname won't appear in starship until a commit is made to the branch.\r\n\r\nIf git2 provides a way to read the default branch name, we can use that,\r\nbut at the moment it's not obvious how.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, we can directly read `.git/HEAD`, which contains the\r\nname of the default branch head reference. This commit implements this\r\nstrategy.\r\n\r\nCloses #1327\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n#### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, tests ran to see how -->\r\n<!--- your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nI've updated the `git_branch::...unborn_master` to `git_branch::...unborn_default_branch`, where the default branch name is set in `.git/HEAD`.\r\n\r\nI've also done manual testing on Linux, where I created a new git repo with default branch `main` in `.git/HEAD`, then run the locally built version of starship in that repo as `../starship/target/debug/starship module git_branch`.\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested using **MacOS**\r\n- [x] I have tested using **Linux**\r\n- [x] I have tested using **Windows**\r\n\r\n#### Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask.
