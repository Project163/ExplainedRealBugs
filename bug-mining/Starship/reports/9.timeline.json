this is my first real piece of rust code, so any tips are greatly appreciated! I left some review comments myself.\r\n\r\n#### Description\r\nThis adds an option to provide a list of pairs of strings to substitute in the directory string. If this option is used, fish-style PWD is disabled.\r\n\r\nThe reason for fish-style PWD being disabled is an implementation detail -- I perform the `replace` on the `dir_string`, since it is a string type rather than a path type. To make this work with fish-style PWD would need more code, and IMO I don't see the need to use both features at once. Would definitely appreciate more input here.\r\n\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\nI'm currently using this at work to shorten paths that have a long common prefix, interesting middle, and some long development directories. It's a more tailored way of shortening paths while retaining more information than, say the fish-style.\r\nCloses #1065.\r\n\r\n#### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n\r\n#### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nAdded a unit test and two \"testsuite\" tests. They test the interaction with `truncation_length` and (non-)interaction with `fish_style_pwd_dir_length`.\r\n\r\n- [x] I have tested using **MacOS**\r\n- [x] I have tested using **Linux**\r\n- [ ] I have tested using **Windows**\r\n\r\n#### Checklist:\r\n- [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [x] I have updated the tests accordingly.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/1183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/1183/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3390815062,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzM5MDgxNTA2Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/events/3390815062","actor":{"login":"andytom","id":108836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODgzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom","html_url":"https://github.com/andytom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-31T17:32:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3390815081,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMzOTA4MTUwODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/events/3390815081","actor":{"login":"andytom","id":108836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODgzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom","html_url":"https://github.com/andytom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ab1c3d1c5431a4fbc9a7e2d268feb28c0c2b8e5f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/commits/ab1c3d1c5431a4fbc9a7e2d268feb28c0c2b8e5f","created_at":"2020-05-31T17:32:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5502852396,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCqswNs4ji0hdzwAAAAFH_t0s","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/events/5502852396","actor":{"login":"dagbrown","id":2619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagbrown","html_url":"https://github.com/dagbrown","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagbrown/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagbrown/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagbrown/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagbrown/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagbrown/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagbrown/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagbrown/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagbrown/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagbrown/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e09f4293df0950833cafb8d13183202172c50179","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dagbrown/starship/commits/e09f4293df0950833cafb8d13183202172c50179","created_at":"2021-10-22T06:48:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
