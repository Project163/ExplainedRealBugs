It could happen instead of (or before?) the truncation to `truncation_length`. I currently use this in my bash prompt to remove a long common prefix (network drive) from my paths so I can put them on $PS1. Specifically, instead of `/.../.../.../A/.../B/C`, I get `A/./B/C`, where `...` is multiple letters and `.` is just one.\r\n\r\nIt could be configured as a list of (literal, not regex) substitutions to make (in order) like:\r\n```\r\n[directory]\r\nsubstitute = [\r\n  [ \"/foo/bar\", \"/f\" ],\r\n  [ \"/f\", \"/baz\" ]\r\n]\r\n```\r\nWhat do you think, would anyone find this useful?","closed_by":{"login":"andytom","id":108836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODgzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom","html_url":"https://github.com/andytom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/1065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/1065/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
