Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title above -->\r\n<!--- To help with semantic versioning the PR title should start with one of the conventional commit types. -->\r\n<!--- The conventional commit types for Semantic PR are: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert -->\r\n\r\n#### Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nI update the battery module, in order to implement an aggregating view of all the batteries present in the notebook.\r\nThe percentage of the battery is calculated with a weighted average of the energy of all the batteries. Instead, the battery state is calculated with the following rule:\r\n- Charging if at least one is Charging\r\n- Discharging if at least one is Discharging\r\n- Full if all are Full\r\n- Empty if all are Empty\r\n- Unknown otherwise \r\n\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->\r\n<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->\r\nAs stated in issue #656 if there are multiple batteries in the notebook the battery module gives inconsistent values of the battery percentage and state.\r\n\r\n#### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n#### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, tests ran to see how -->\r\n<!--- your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nI test it on my Lenovo T450s that has two batteries. For now, there is not any unit test on the battery module.\r\n- [ ] I have tested using **MacOS**\r\n- [x] I have tested using **Linux**\r\n- [ ] I have tested using **Windows**\r\n\r\n#### Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! -->\r\n- [ ] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [ ] I have updated the tests
