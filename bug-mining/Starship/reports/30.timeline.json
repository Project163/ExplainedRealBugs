Current Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen something causes the config to be invalid, the warning regarding it only displays the first time it is encountered.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1034\" alt=\"only one warning\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/275142/195675721-b756db61-5dd5-4183-a77c-801a1748df88.png\">\r\n\r\nThe screenshot above employs the following two config files:\r\n\r\n`~/.config/starship.working.toml` (also `~/.config/starship.toml` at the beginning)\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nformat = 'Hello! $character'\r\n\r\n[shell]\r\ndisabled = false\r\n```\r\n\r\n`~/.config/starship.broken.toml`\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nformat = 'Hello! $character'\r\n\r\n# This should be \"golang\".\r\n[go]\r\ndisabled = true\r\n\r\n[shell]\r\ndisabled = false\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nA warning is emitted every time an invalid configuration is encountered.\r\n\r\n#### Additional context/Screenshots\r\n\r\nI haven't looked through the code for this, but it seems like something that could be intentional (e.g. to avoid spamming the user with warnings). Even if so, however, I feel that failing to print a warning causes more problems than it might solve.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I was setting up Starship for the first time, misread the config page, and created a `[go]` section instead of a `[golang]` section. This caused my top-level `format=` to be ignored (see #4481), which I then spent over an hour debugging because I missed the initial warning about the `[go]` section and happened never to open another terminal window. 😭\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Worse, the warning doesn't show up when running <code>STARSHIP_LOG=trace starship explain</code>.</summary>\r\n\r\n```text\r\n[TRACE] - (starship):

an issue where the config was not being loaded when ignored properties are present. This still prints a warning log indicating a possible misconfiguration.\r\n<!--- Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title above -->\r\n<!--- To help with semantic versioning the PR title should start with one of the conventional commit types. -->\r\n<!--- The conventional commit types for Semantic PR are: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert -->\r\n\r\n#### Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n~~The deserializer wrapper has been updated such that deserialization of ignored properties does not return an error, and instead returns the `visitor.visit_none()`. This function now includes a warning log statement since the [log statement for reporting the error](https://github.com/starship/starship/blob/master/src/config.rs#L34) as shown in the bug ticket is no longer reached.~~ (this described the initial implementation before PR review)\r\n\r\nThe `ValueDeserializer` wrapper has been updated so that warnings can be either ignored or cause an `Err` result. At this time, the only warning that gets emitted is the warning from ignored properties during deserialization. This can be used via the new `with_allow_unknown_keys` function.\r\n\r\nThe configurable warning behavior is used within the generic `from_config` implementation of `ModuleConfig`, wherein the deserializer wrapper is used to load the config. If it reports an \"Unknown key\" error, then the config is loaded again and deserialized without reporting warnings. This results in the warning be reported without preventing the otherwise valid config being loaded and returned.\r\n\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->\r\n<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->\r\nCloses #4481 \r\n\r\n#### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\nIn this screenshot, I'm showing that as I initialize starship with these changes, we can see I have not set a custom format (the line in the config is commented out), and the unexpected property \"go\" is detected and a warning is printed. After updating the config to enable the format using `sed`, the shell format is updated with the new prompt without resolving the unexpected config field.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"642\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3588764/198867545-a34cd3a4-f83d-4958-a766-35a4fa66908c.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, tests ran to see how -->\r\n<!--- your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n- [x] I have tested using **MacOS**\r\n- [ ] I have tested using **Linux**\r\n- [ ] I have tested using **Windows**\r\n\r\n1. set `~/.config/starship.toml` with an unexpected key like the following:\r\n```toml\r\nformat = 'Hello! $character'\r\n\r\n# This should be \"golang\".\r\n[go]\r\ndisabled = true\r\n\r\n[shell]\r\ndisabled = false\r\n```\r\n2. re-initialize starship using the build with `eval \"$(cargo run init zsh)\"` (I'm using `zsh`, but the shell type doesn't matter in this case)\r\n3.
