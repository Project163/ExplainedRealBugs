I have a handfull options in mind:\r\n1. **Silence the error**. Assuming #982 was merged intentionally and we don't want to simply revert it, this may have to be controlled by a config option.\r\n2. **Reflect the error in the prompt itself**. For example, printing `missing!` in place of the version number may be enough to clue the user in.\r\n3. **Print it once and then silence it**. This way we can still be expressive to the user and not spam them.\r\n4. **Introduce `starship doctor` to print these errors**. `doctor` is starting to become a staple of command line tools lately and I have found it very useful. This option would be similar to 1 where `starship prompt` will silence the errors and `starship doctor` prints them.\r\n5. **Print errors in `starship explain`**. The same as 4 but added to `explain` instead of a new subcommand.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, I would expect the error message to read more like English prose, eg:\r\n> ERROR Failed to find \"node\" executable. Maybe it isn't installed?\r\n\r\nI feel confident to tackle this in a PR once I have some direction on how others are more comfortable for this to be tackled.\r\n\r\n#### Environment\r\n- Starship version: 0.38.0\r\n- fish version: fish, version 3.1.0\r\n- Operating system: Mac OS 10.14.6\r\n- Terminal emulator: Alacritty <unknown version>\r\n\r\n#### Relevant Shell Configuration\r\n\r\n```bash\r\neval (starship init fish)\r\n\r\n[ -f /usr/local/share/autojump/autojump.fish ]; and source /usr/local/share/autojump/autojump.fish\r\n\r\nsource /usr/local/share/chruby/chruby.fish\r\nsource /usr/local/share/chruby/auto.fish\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"matchai","id":4658208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4658208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai","html_url":"https://github.com/matchai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/1020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/1020/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
