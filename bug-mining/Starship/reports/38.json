devices\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\nit returs correct username which looks something like like `u0_*`\r\n\r\n#### Additional context/Screenshots\r\nthis is caused by the [switch to whoami crate](https://github.com/starship/starship/pull/6311) which currently [does not support android](https://github.com/ardaku/whoami?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-platforms)\r\n\r\n#### Possible Solution\r\nfallback to older implementation when target_os is android\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/modules/username.rs b/src/modules/username.rs\r\nindex 8ba3509..e3e1a83 100644\r\n--- a/src/modules/username.rs\r\n+++ b/src/modules/username.rs\r\n@@ -25,7 +25,7 @@ pub fn module<'a>(context: &'a Context) -> Option<Module<'a>> {\r\n         .ok()\r\n         .or_else(||

[termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)\r\n- Operating system: Android 14\r\n\r\n#### Starship Configuration\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[username]\r\nformat = ' [ $user](bright-yellow)'\r\nshow_always

true\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"davidkna","id":835177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTE3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/835177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna","html_url":"https://github.com/davidkna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/6340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/6340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
