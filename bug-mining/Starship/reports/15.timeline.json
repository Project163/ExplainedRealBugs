Feature Request\r\n\r\n#### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\r\nLet's imagine we have a custom `starship.toml` configuration like this:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n# ~/.config/starship.toml\r\n\r\n[kubernetes]\r\nformat = 'on [⛵ $context \\($namespace\\)](dimmed green) '\r\ndisabled = false\r\n```\r\nℹ: _I will be used _Kubernetes_ example in this issue._\r\n\r\nSo, notice that we always have to see that module till manually disabled from file by _hand_. Even we really do not need to see it, use it, etc, we really need a toggle function in [Advanced Configuration](https://starship.rs/advanced-config/).\r\n\r\n```\r\non ⛵ dev-stage-local.idc (dev) ~/.config took 3m6s\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is really annoying that every time we have to see this. Just instead of: `~/.config` Isn't it? Thus, ever time when I need to see more information about that specific module, I have to toggle `disabled` flag in configration file.\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nWhat about _Toggle Aliases_?\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[kubernetes]\r\nformat = 'on [⛵ $context \\($namespace\\)](dimmed green) '\r\ndisabled = false\r\ntoggle_alias = 'k8s!'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich means that, this module should always be started as disabled when terminal being started, as you think.\r\n\r\nIf we want to start dealing with some _Kubernetes_ stuffs any time, any where, we can simply call `k8s!` _alias_, in order to toggle `(disabled=!disabled)` that module's active status for _current terminal session only_.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/1873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/1873/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/comments/727246603","html_url":"https://github.com/starship/starship/issues/894#issuecomment-727246603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/894","id":727246603,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNzI0NjYwMw==","user":{"login":"Dentrax","id":16493751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDkzNzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16493751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax","html_url":"https://github.com/Dentrax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-14T18:24:05Z","updated_at":"2020-11-14T18:24:05Z","body":"@andytom Would you like any help with this issue?

What about other _custom_ flag _toggle-abilities_.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ starship toggle <module>\r\n$ starship config toggle <module>\r\n$ starship toggle config <module>\r\n```\r\n\r\n-or-\r\n\r\nShould we concern for any other flags instead of just `disabled`? \r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ starship config toggle git_branch.only_detached\r\n$ starship config toggle nodejs.display_private\r\n```","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/comments/727246603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Dentrax","id":16493751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDkzNzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16493751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax","html_url":"https://github.com/Dentrax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3996654611,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzk5NjY1NDYxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/events/3996654611","actor":{"login":"andytom","id":108836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODgzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom","html_url":"https://github.com/andytom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-14T18:24:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3996654612,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5OTY2NTQ2MTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/events/3996654612","actor":{"login":"andytom","id":108836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODgzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom","html_url":"https://github.com/andytom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-14T18:24:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/comments/731334238","html_url":"https://github.com/starship/starship/issues/894#issuecomment-731334238","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/894","id":731334238,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMTMzNDIzOA==","user":{"login":"andytom","id":108836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODgzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom","html_url":"https://github.com/andytom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-20T18:21:27Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T18:21:27Z","body":"@Dentrax,

So maybe add a new sub-command `toggle` with a usage something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ starship toggle MODULE_NAME [OPTION]\r\n```\r\n\r\n`MODULE_NAME` would just be the name of the module e.g `nodejs`

command.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/comments/731592623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andytom","id":108836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODgzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom","html_url":"https://github.com/andytom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4023934505,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDAyMzkzNDUwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/events/4023934505","actor":{"login":"andytom","id":108836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODgzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom","html_url":"https://github.com/andytom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-21T15:17:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4023934507,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwMjM5MzQ1MDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/events/4023934507","actor":{"login":"andytom","id":108836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODgzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom","html_url":"https://github.com/andytom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-21T15:17:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4024158717,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQwMjQxNTg3MTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/events/4024158717","actor":{"login":"Dentrax","id":16493751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDkzNzUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16493751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax","html_url":"https://github.com/Dentrax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentrax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bc1d6265c5f147b62340cc9d6fabb1e2fe2e94a3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Dentrax/starship/commits/bc1d6265c5f147b62340cc9d6fabb1e2fe2e94a3","created_at":"2020-11-21T19:56:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4024184903,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZW

#894\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Dentrax <furkan.turkal@hotmail.com>\r\n\r\n#### Description\r\nSee the given issue in order to get more description about the `toggle` feature.\r\n\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\nAs requested at #894 and #1873, this PR adds brand new `toggle` command.\r\n\r\n#### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/374476.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/374476)\r\n\r\n#### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n* Given module name and flag key exist without arg:\r\n```sh\r\n$ dasel select -f ~/.config/starship.toml -p toml -m '.kubernetes.disabled' # returns 'true'\r\n$ cargo run toggle kubernetes\r\n$ dasel select -f ~/.config/starship.toml -p toml -m '.kubernetes.disabled' # returns 'false'\r\n```\r\n* Given module name and flag key exist with arg:\r\n```sh\r\n$ dasel select -f ~/.config/starship.toml -p toml -m '.kubernetes.disabled' # returns 'true'\r\n$ cargo run toggle kubernetes disabled\r\n$ dasel select -f ~/.config/starship.toml -p toml -m '.kubernetes.disabled' # returns 'false'\r\n```\r\n* Given module name exist but flag key not exist with arg:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cargo run toggle kubernetes show_namespace\r\n```\r\n_See the error:_ `[ERROR] - (starship::configure): Given config key 'show_namespace' must be exist in config file`\r\n* Given module name and `non-boolean` flag key exist with arg:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cargo run toggle kubernetes format\r\n```\r\n_See the error:_ `[ERROR] - (starship::configure): Given config key 'format' must be in 'boolean' format`\r\n* Given module name not exist:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cargo run toggle winamp\r\n```\r\nThis will panic-ed, it works the same as the `update_configuration()` function. We just ignored the `None` case, by using this: `table.get(keys[0]).unwrap()`. Shouldn't we cover the case of `None`? What about adding a new fatal message like: ``[ERROR] - (starship::configure): Given module 'winamp' not found in config file``\r\n* Given module name and flag key not exist:\r\n```sh\r\n$ cargo run toggle winamp volume\r\n```\r\nSame as above.\r\n\r\n- [X] I have tested using **MacOS**\r\n- [ ] I have tested using **Linux**\r\n- [ ] I have tested using **Windows**\r\n\r\n#### Checklist:\r\n_Some
