Please describe.\r\nI find myself quite often toggling on and off individual parts of the prompt, depending on what I am currently doing. For example when I am working with kubernetes, I have the kubernetes prompt activated, but since it's quite long I usually de-activate it for all other work.\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. Add any considered drawbacks. -->\r\nI'd love to have a simple toggle command, that allows you to activate and deactivate parts of the prompt on demand.\r\n\r\nThis of course could be done in a variety of ways, the most simple one I came up with was to have a `toggle` command that takes in a \"prompt part\":\r\n```\r\nstarship toggle <prompt>\r\n```\r\n\\<prompt\\> would be any of https://starship.rs/config/#prompt\r\n\r\nso to toggle kubernetes it could be:\r\n```\r\nstarship toggle kubernetes\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this idea, starship would determine behind the scenes if the current prompt part is activated or deactivated, choose the corresponding toggle action, and automatically \"reload\" the prompt.\r\n\r\n#### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\nCurrently I simply change it in the `starship.toml` and re-run `starship init`.","closed_by":{"login":"andytom","id":108836,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODgzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108836?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom","html_url":"https://github.com/andytom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andytom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/894/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/894/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
