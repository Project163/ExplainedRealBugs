It also fails to detect Windows Terminal which I also filled manually)\r\n\r\n#### Expected Behavior\r\n`STARSHIP_SHELL` should be `pwsh` when running under PowerShell Core and `powershell` when running under ye olde Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\n#### Additional context/Screenshots\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here.
