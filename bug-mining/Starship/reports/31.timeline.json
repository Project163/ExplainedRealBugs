shells that don't have native rprompt support enabled, use a fallback mechanism in the starship binary that print the rprompt after the main prompt via fill segments and ANSI sequences to save and restore the cursor positioning. The rprompt won't be printed if it would cause the line to overflow.\r\n\r\nI've moved that code handles modules and `$all` in `get_prompt` for the active top-level format string into `StringFormatter::map_to_modules` to allow its use by both the main prompt and the rprompt. I also added a new `Segment`-type `Control` which holds a static string that gets ignored in width-calculations.\r\n\r\nCompared to native rprompt this approach has some disadvantages:\r\n> The right prompt will be printed in other shells as well, but it can behave differently. For instance, the right prompt won't be cleared once the input starts overlapping with the right prompt, and it might not line up correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required?
