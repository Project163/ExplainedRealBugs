Please describe.\r\nOn initializing a git repo, the git branch module will always show `master` as the name, because no branch has been created until a commit is made and the default is `master`.\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI hope that there is a way to retrieve the actual name of initial branch. `git status --porcelain --branch` can return `## No commits yet on main`, so there's some way somewhere; perhaps it's in `git2` already (I looked, but may have missed it). I filed an issue in `git2`: https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs/issues/570\r\n\r\n#### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nI guess that always showing `master` as default is the alternative. Or perhaps showing something like `no branch` as default, but that would probably be confusing.\r\n\r\nSome other statusline parses the output of the cli, but it doesn't make sense to switch away from `git2`.","closed_by":{"login":"matchai","id":4658208,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NTgyMDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4658208?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai","html_url":"https://github.com/matchai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matchai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/1327/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/1327/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
