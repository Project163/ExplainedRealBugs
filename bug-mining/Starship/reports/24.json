Please describe.\r\nstarship doesn't include a Windows application manifest, which triggers all sorts compatibility behavior by Windows which can possibly slow down process startup (And which, regrettably, don't seem to be well documented, at least I wasn't able to find a clear documentation of them).\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nJust add a manifest with the wanted attributes. Sadly, this isn't yet handled by Rust automatically. (And even MSVC still doesn't have UI to add the `supportedOS` stuff, it only adds the UAC attribute).\r\n\r\n#### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nIt can also be included as a separate file next to the executable, but an embedded manifest is still cleaner IMHO.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we can consider if we need [activeCodePage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sbscs/application-manifests#activecodepage) and/or [longPathAware](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sbscs/application-manifests#longPathAware). Though I think Rust stdio already handles console output encoding so `activeCodePage` might not have any effect, and `longPathAware` kinda depends on if the shell uses it or not for it to have any meaning. (It could be passing/using literal `\\\\?\\` paths)\r\n\r\nThis can also be used to add `VERSIONINFO` but there might be an easier way to generate that. Or an icon, which isn't really important for a CLI app.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sbscs/application-manifests\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"davidkna","id":835177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNTE3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/835177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna","html_url":"https://github.com/davidkna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/3589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/starship/starship/issues/3589/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
