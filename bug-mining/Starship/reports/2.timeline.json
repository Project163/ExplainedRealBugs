in the directory module.\r\n\r\nThis is a duplicate of #352, which was repeatedly failing due to (what seems like) a bug in GH Actions on clone. Hoping that a new PR works better.\r\n#### Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\n\r\nAdds the ability for starship to display the logical path instead of the physical path. \r\n\r\n#### Motivation and Context\r\n<!--- Why is this change required? What problem does it solve? -->\r\n<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->\r\n\r\nPhysical paths are useful because there is usually only one canonical physical path. However, this physical path is sometimes not intuitive for users (e.g. `/storage/volumes/group/200/user/15ae2` as opposed to `~/storage`). The logical path is easier for the user to understand.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an option to directory, `use_logical_path`. When it is set to `true` (which is its default value), the directory module attempts to use the `PWD` environment variable as the path instead of the path within context. If any of its lookups fail (e.g. because PWD is not valid unicode) it will fall back to using the physical path.\r\n\r\n`PWD` appears to be a widely-accepted standard. For example, GNU Coreutils `pwd` uses this when running under `pwd -L` to try to get the logical path. Nonetheless, this may fail on systems like MacOS, BSD, Termux, and Windows.\r\n\r\nCloses #270 \r\n\r\n#### Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n\r\nBreaking new feature?\r\n\r\nIf anyone is trying to parse the output of starship for some reason, this may break their setup because the current setting is to try to do logical paths by default.
