I found that somewhere in the recursion path the normal SchemaFactory was used instead of the HyperSchemaFactory.\n\nAfter digging in the code I pinpointed that **HyperSchemaFactoryWrapperFactory** only overrides \n\n```\npublic SchemaFactoryWrapper getWrapper(SerializerProvider p)  \n```\n\nand should also override\n\n```\npublic SchemaFactoryWrapper getWrapper(SerializerProvider  rovider, VisitorContext rvc) \n```\n\nI guess the following should work\n\n```\nprivate static class HyperSchemaFactoryWrapperFactory extends WrapperFactory\n{\n    @Override\n    public SchemaFactoryWrapper getWrapper(SerializerProvider p) {\n        SchemaFactoryWrapper wrapper = new HyperSchemaFactoryWrapper();\n        wrapper.setProvider(p);\n        return wrapper;\n    };\n\n    @Override\n    public SchemaFactoryWrapper getWrapper(SerializerProvider provider, VisitorContext rvc)\n    {\n        SchemaFactoryWrapper wrapper = new HyperSchemaFactoryWrapper();\n        wrapper.setProvider(provider);\n        wrapper.setVisitorContext(rvc);\n        return wrapper;\n    }\n};\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-jsonSchema/issues/104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-module-jsonSchema/issues/104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
