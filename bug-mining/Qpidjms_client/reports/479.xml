                            <comment id="13527874" author="gemmellr" created="Mon, 10 Dec 2012 11:17:46 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;amp;revision=1418541&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;amp;revision=1418541&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the previous changes relating to this JIRA were part of 0.20, this one is not. Either this should be requested for merging (after any changes such as the review below) or it should have a new JIRA to allow properly tracking what the change is and when it was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given you did multiple commits for particular JIRAs (including this one: see also &lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;amp;revision=1418543&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&amp;amp;revision=1418543&lt;/a&gt;) back to back with this commit, is there any particular reason you couldn&apos;t separate the changes so as not to commit two totally unrelated changes to two different JIRAs at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new check below for whether the subscription queue is marked durable when no queue name was provided seems to be in the wrong place, and performing the wrong check. Why not throw the exception at the existing point earlier in the method that we explicitly check whether a queue name was specified, instead of erroneously assuming that &quot;TempQueue&quot; at the start means the same thing (as misguided a name as it may seem its perfectly legal for a user to pick that format for their durable queue names). Did I miss the new tests?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13528281" author="rajith" created="Mon, 10 Dec 2012 20:59:07 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I did ask Justin offline about this, but given he has already got RC2 out and given this wasn&apos;t a critical issue it was decided to be included in the next release.&lt;br/&gt;
This change was done as a result of a review comment that was associated with the commits I made under that JIRA.&lt;br/&gt;
Given it was a very small change I decided to put under the same JIRA as opposed to creating a new JIRA which I agree is a mistake in hindsight.&lt;br/&gt;
(There is also a comment asking to look at refactoring two methods which I will handle as a separate JIRA.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do agree that two separate commits would have been better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think we are performing the wrong check. However I agree that a more appropriate place for this check is where we test if the queue name is empty.&lt;br/&gt;
If somebody names their queue TempQueue* then they should seriously consider the name or marking the queue durable &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I will move the check to where we test for queue name.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13528293" author="gemmellr" created="Mon, 10 Dec 2012 21:09:09 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I agree it would seem foolish to name them that way but it is still legal and it isn&apos;t really our place to enforce what people call their queues, particularly in this one case as we don&apos;t make the same enforcement anywhere else queues can be created.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13652995" author="rajith" created="Thu, 9 May 2013 14:52:55 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;This has been fixed for a while. Any issues arising out of this should be handled via separate JIRA&apos;s&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
