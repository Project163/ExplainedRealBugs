Only later I found it here, because I also just wanted to raise an issue for it.\r\n\r\nActually, this not only happens for this rather strange scenario using both self-injection and `@Transactional` from within the `ApplicationListener` implementation, but in other cases where listener is being proxied, too, for example if it is the target of a Spring AOP `@Aspect`. This is a fact, not pure speculation. I tried, and the result is the same.\r\n\r\nAs for the root cause: In `AbstractApplicationEventMulticaster.retrieveApplicationListeners`, there are two loops searching for listeners. The first one finds the original listener, the second one finds the bean, which yields a proxy instance.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/c9e781676271a980d39063fc1f23a348b0d37be1/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/context/event/AbstractApplicationEventMulticaster.java#L224-L232\r\n\r\nThis would be relatively easy to remedy,\r\n  * either by checking `allListeners` for duplicates after both loops have finished\r\n  * or by checking for existing non-proxy elements upon inserting in the loop checking registered beans.\r\n\r\nDuplicates in this context could be identified by  `AopProxyUtils.getSingletonTarget(listener)`.\r\n\r\nHow about this?\r\n\r\n```patch\r\n--- a/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/context/event/AbstractApplicationEventMulticaster.java\t(revision Staged)\r\n+++ b/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/context/event/AbstractApplicationEventMulticaster.java\t(date 1649655053343)\r\n@@ -260,8 +260,9 @@\r\n \t\t\tfor (String listenerBeanName : listenerBeans) {\r\n \t\t\t\ttry {\r\n \t\t\t\t\tif (supportsEvent(beanFactory, listenerBeanName, eventType)) {\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\tApplicationListener<?> listener =\r\n-\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeanFactory.getBean(listenerBeanName, ApplicationListener.class);\r\n+\t\t\t\t\t\tApplicationListener<?> listener = (ApplicationListener<?>) AopProxyUtils.getSingletonTarget(\r\n+\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbeanFactory.getBean(listenerBeanName, ApplicationListener.class)\r\n+\t\t\t\t\t\t);\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\tif (!allListeners.contains(listener) && supportsEvent(listener, eventType, sourceType)) {\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (retriever != null) {\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (beanFactory.isSingleton(listenerBeanName)) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fixes the problem, at least in this context. It might cause problems elsewhere, please verify. If this is OK, would you like to have a PR? If so, for which branch? _5.3.x_ or _main_? Maybe I could create a PR for _main_ and a committer could back-port it to all relevant versions which still get updates.\r\n\r\nActually, in the same class there is some proxy unwrapping going on in another place already, seemingly in order to **avoid** getting unwrapped objects into the list of listeners, which is the opposite of what my patch does. Hmm...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/c9e781676271a980d39063fc1f23a348b0d37be1/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/context/event/AbstractApplicationEventMulticaster.java#L106-L111\r\n\r\n**Edit:** I just debugged into that code, and it is called indirectly via `AbstractBeanFactory.getBean(String)` and `AbstractAutowireCapableBeanFactory.createBean(String, RootBeanDefinition, Object[])`, as you can see here:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1537384/162677617-ef2336be-16c1-4313-866e-fa8a6678c2ab.png)\r\n\r\nIf you look at the variables in the top stack frame, you see that in `AbstractApplicationEventMulticaster.addApplicationListener(ApplicationListener<?>)` the method parameter `listener` is an unwrapped bean, but at the same time the proxy exists already, as can be seen when inspecting the value of `listener.eventDemoListener` (the auto-wired self-reference). So along the way, somehow the proxy gets lost or is never retrieved. I.e., the logic in `addApplicationListener` cannot avoid the unwrapped listener to be added to the list, because what it sees is unwrapped already. I.e., my workaround in the patch above to also unwrap the bean is something that might cause duplicate calls in other situations when `addApplicationListener` really does get called with a proxy instance. Then it would not unwrap it, but in the beans list we would have an unwrapped object due to my patch. \r\n\r\nIn which way ever this problem is going to be solved, it would be important to either never or always unwrap proxies in order to avoid effective duplicates. To always unwrap would be safe, because unwrapping is always possible, but determining if there is a proxy for the method parameter in `addApplicationListener` elsewhere is not easily possible. Another workaround would be to make sure that `addApplicationListener` is never called with an unwrapped object in the first place, if a proxy exists. But how to ensure that, is beyond my knowledge.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/comments/1094584772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kriegaex","id":1537384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzczODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1537384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex","html_url":"https://github.com/kriegaex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/comments/1094662810","html_url":"https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/28283#issuecomment-1094662810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/28283","id":1094662810,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABGHUc5BPzqa","user":{"login":"kriegaex","id":1537384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzczODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1537384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex","html_url":"https://github.com/kriegaex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegaex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-11T07:46:01Z","updated_at":"2022-04-11T08:20:13Z","body":"I think I found a better, more universal solution and created a PR:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/1da3022c27a928988758a5f6bc43913f19eccccf/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/context/event/AbstractApplicationEventMulticaster.java#L266-L281\r\n\r\nI am confident that this is going to work.
