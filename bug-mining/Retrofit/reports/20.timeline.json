are still some missing pieces not mentioned above that my team has found out the hard way. This is our take:\n\n```\n-dontwarn retrofit.**\n-keep class retrofit.** { *; }\n-keepattributes Signature\n-keepattributes Exceptions\n```\n\nYou need `-keepattributes Signature` if in your rest service interface you use methods with `Callback` argument. This argument is of generic type and Retrofit checks it at runtime. Proguard strips generic type information by default and this flag keeps it.\n\n`-keepattributes Exceptions` is needed if your rest service methods throw custom exceptions, because you've defined an `ErrorHandler` that returns such exceptions. Again, at runtime Retrofit verifies if an exception returned by an `ErrorHandler` was declared on the interface. And again, Proguard by default strips information about exceptions declared on methods and this flag tells it to keep them.\n\nYou can find answers for specific problems on Stack Overflow once you come across them and have an exception to paste into Google. But this should help to prevent those problems for all the people who find this issue after searching Google with much more generic search term.\n\nOne other thing to note is that by default Retrofit uses GSON to convert server responses and you need some more Proguard configuration for GSON. But that is covered well on Stack Overflow and [by the GSON team](http://google-gson.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/android-proguard-example/proguard.cfg) (though some of their configuration is not need on Android or do not apply to Android).\n\n@JakeWharton I'd love to contribute our configuration to the Retrofit website. Is adding a new section for it between \"Download\" and \"Contributing\" all right? If not, it'd be great if you suggested an acceptable place for it.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/retrofit/issues/comments/85517752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"marcin-kozinski","id":2088582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODg1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2088582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski","html_url":"https://github.com/marcin-kozinski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":263548025,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYzNTQ4MDI1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/retrofit/issues/events/263548025","actor":{"login":"JakeWharton","id":66577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton","html_url":"https://github.com/JakeWharton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-24T14:22:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":263548026,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MzU0ODAyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/retrofit/issues/events/263548026","actor":{"login":"JakeWharton","id":66577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton","html_url":"https://github.com/JakeWharton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JakeWharton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-24T14:22:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"marcin-kozinski","id":2088582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODg1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2088582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski","html_url":"https://github.com/marcin-kozinski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcin-kozinski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-08T11:32:18Z","updated_at":"2015-04-08T11:32:18Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/retrofit/issues/803","repository_url":"https:
