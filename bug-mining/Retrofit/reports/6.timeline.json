This `TypedInput` is handed directly to the response converter which is responsible for decoding the bytes in accordance to the MIME type and encoding. Having the iteration here is not only redundant, but unnecessary.\n\nIt should be the responsibility of the converter to determine whether or not a MIME type is invalid. We probably shouldn't be enforcing this by default since we don't live in a perfect world of well-behaved servers. Theoretically you could deal with a server that sends down ASCII text documents and your converter turns them into `String`s which should be a perfectly valid
