For my purposes I've recently needed to do the following things:\n- remove units (I think I can just divide the units away: 200px/1px = 200)\n- remove the beginning hash from a color (#ffffff -> ffffff)\n- use sine, cosine, tangent functions for calculating angles\n- get a hex number from a decimal number\n\n``` scss\n      @mixin ie-text-shadow($x, $y, $radius:1px, $color: #000000) {\n          // TODO: use sine/cosine to get the angle from the x and y\n          //$angle: arctan($x/$y);\n          $filter: Shadow(Color=#{$color}, Direction=#{$angle}, Strength=#{$radius/1px});\n          .ielt8 & {\n              filter: $filter;\n          }\n          .ie8 & {\n              -ms-filter: quote($filter);\n          }\n      }\n      @mixin ie-background-rgba($color: #ffffff, $alpha:1) {\n          // TODO: convert the $alpha into a hex\n          //$color: ($color) + hex($alpha);\n          $filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorStr='#{$color}',EndColorStr='#{$color}');\n          .ielt8 & {\n              background: none;\n              filter: $filter;\n          }\n          .ie8 & {\n              background: none;\n              -ms-filter: quote($filter);\n          }\n      }\n```\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
