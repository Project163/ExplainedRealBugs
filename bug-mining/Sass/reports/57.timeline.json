for the trouble, folks! This is the result of an unintentional backwards incompatibility in first-class calc support: we're now parsing `min()` and `max()` expressions as calculations if they're valid calculations, but we didn't take into account the fact that calculations are a bit stricter about units than the old global `min()` and `max()` functions. We'll need to take some time to design a more compatible way of handling this, but for the time being I'm going to partially revert this behavior:\r\n\r\n* `min()` and `max()` functions that appear outside of calculations will be parsed the same way they were in 1.39.2, as global function calls if they contain any Sass-specific arguments and as unquoted strings if they don't.\r\n* `min()` and `max()` functions *within* calculations will continue to be parsed as calculations, since they could never have been parsed as global function calls in the first place.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/comments/918923271/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"caugner","id":495429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTQyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/495429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caugner","html_url":"https://github.com/caugner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caugner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caugner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caugner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caugner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caugner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caugner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caugner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caugner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caugner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-14T08:20:01Z","updated_at":"2021-09-14T08:20:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap/issues/34969","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap/issues/34969/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap/issues/34969/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap/issues/34969/events","html_url":"https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/34969","id":995609696,"node_id":"I_kwDOACBxpM47V8xg","number":34969,"title":"Build

This means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>calc()</code> expressions will be parsed more thoroughly, and errors will be\nhighlighted where they weren't before. <strong>This may break your stylesheets,</strong>\nbut only if they were already producing broken CSS.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>calc()</code> expressions will be simplified where possible, and may even return\nnumbers if they can be simplified away entirely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>calc()</code> expressions that can't be simplified to numbers return a new data\ntype known as &quot;calculations&quot;.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sass variables and functions can now be used in <code>calc()</code> expressions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New functions <code>meta.calc-name()</code> and <code>meta.calc-args()</code> can now inspect\ncalculations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dart API</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Add a new value type, <code>SassCalculation</code>, that represents calculations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add new <code>CalculationOperation</code>, <code>CalculationOperator</code>, and\n<code>CalculationInterpolation</code> types to represent types of arguments that may\nexist as part of a calculation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add a new <code>Value.assertCalculation()</code> method.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add a new <code>Number.hasCompatibleUnits()</code> method.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.39.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a bug where configuring with <code>@use ... with</code> would throw an error when\nthat variable was defined in a module that also contained <code>@forward ... with</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.39.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Partial fix for a bug where <code>@at-root</code> does not work properly in nested\nimports that contain <code>@use</code> rules. If the only <code>@use</code> rules in the nested\nimport are for built-in modules, <code>@at-root</code> should now work properly.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/commit/bb0867270cb6583be7c055427ebd35e054a00b86\"><code>bb08672</code></a> Add support for first-class calc() (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/1452\">#1452</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/commit/33dab9ff7e85dc4509393d68c4d45ac4871f8370\"><code>33dab9f</code></a> Fix the leftover-configuration check for <code>@forward ... with</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/1472\">#1472</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/commit/1672178f64a274615445c681c10a2f67b6c6aeac\"><code>1672178</code></a> Fix <code>@at-root</code> bug for common case of built-in use (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/1469\">#1469</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/commit/f06937e2df7347ae2e27db17c79df1b1a02cbac0\"><code>f06937e</code></a> Fix analysis errors (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/1470\">#1470</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/commit/78aacbcda24d6ef5ad2d0d8dd892b58cdaa66e28\"><code>78aacbc</code></a> Upgrade to analyzer 2 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/1465\">#1465</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/commit/8012e0e9c93d4936fd6168122f4e964484c38e34\"><code>8012e0e</code></a> Avoid the /-as-division warning when running the dart_api tests (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/1467\">#1467</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/commit/49c75b15097a2727f04a4e6a502cde47c979052e\"><code>49c75b1</code></a> Fix the test covering space-separated list to actually do it (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/1466\">#1466</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/commit/f098c7f5acdf3af7934c25bbe429813821bef803\"><code>f098c7f</code></a> Fix the test description for the list separator of non-empty maps (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/1464\">#1464</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/commit/1288b92b4e9a12f5a1697690ea8e0918d20165a6\"><code>1288b92</code></a> Fix the description of some tests for SassNumber (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/1463\">#1463</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/commit/3112f80d49596badc1e0a758c38cd4b0d518a52f\"><code>3112f80</code></a> Ignore HintCode.UNNECESSARY_TYPE_CHECK_TRUE (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/sass/dart-sass/issues/1457\">#1457</a>)</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/compare/1.39.0...1.40.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=sass&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=1.39.0&new-version=1.40.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
