percentage function currently generates output with precision down to the thousandth of a percent, which, in some cases, will cause some browsers to render elements a pixel narrower than desired. I understand and agree that mathematically it should be adequate, however some browsers need more precision in order to work properly. \n\nConsider an element with a width of 980px and 14px margins, within a container that has a width of 1008px:\n\n``` css\n.container{\n   width 1008px;\n}\n\n.content{\n   margin: 14px;\n   width: 980px;\n}\n```\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"container\">\n   <div class=\"content\">\n      <p>I should be 980px wide!</p>\n   </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nIf we make this simple layout responsive, we'd use the following SCSS:\n\n``` css\n.container{\n   width: 100%;\n   max-width: 1008px;\n   margin: 0 auto;\n}\n\n.content{\n   margin: percentage(14px / 1008px);\n   width: percentage(980px / 1008px);\n}\n```\n\nWhich produces CSS output something like this:\n\n``` css\n.container{\n   width: 100%;\n   max-width: 1008px;\n   margin: 0 auto;\n}\n\n.content{\n   margin: 1.389%;\n   width: 97.222%;\n}\n```\n\n97.222% of 1008 is 979.99776, which means the browser should render it with a width of 980px (IE and Firefox do), but, if you inspect the content element in the latest Chrome (17.0.963.79) in Windows 7 or OS X, the computed width is 979px. That's not really an issue for elements with text, but, if the element contains a 980px wide graphic getting squished to a width of 979px, it looks unacceptably soft.\n\nIn any event, Chrome will not correctly render the content element in this example until there's precision up to a hundred thousandth:\n\n``` css\n.container{\n   width: 100%;\n   max-width: 1008px;\n   margin: 0 auto;\n}\n\n.content{\n   margin: 1.38889%;\n   width: 97.22222%;\n}\n```\n\nSo, while I agree that this rendering issue is a bug with Chrome, it'd be nice if the default precision of the percentage function went out to at least five places beyond the decimal point, or, perhaps more appropriately, if there was an option where the precision could be set when compiling the CSS.\n\nIn Ethan Marcotte's Responsive Web Design book, he routinely went 5-7 places beyond the decimal point, although from looking at his CSS source (http://unstoppablerobotninja.com/-/css/screen/core.css) he's going out 5 places now; so, if I'm crazy for wanting this, at least I'm in good company.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/319/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/comments/9989812","html_url":"https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/1#issuecomment-9989812","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/1","id":9989812,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk5ODk4MTI=","user":{"login":"ultimatedelman","id":453402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzQwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultimatedelman","html_url":"https://github.com/ultimatedelman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultimatedelman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultimatedelman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultimatedelman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultimatedelman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultimatedelman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultimatedelman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultimatedelman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultimatedelman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ultimatedelman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-11-01T18:10:02Z","updated_at":"2012-11-01T18:10:02Z","body":"This is again an issue in whatever new release of SASS. \n\nI have a \"_scaffolding.scss\" file that is imported by all my main .scss files.

Sass has a lot of internal `@charset` handling.\n\nDo either of your files have any non-ASCII characters in them at all? What do you get if you run `ruby -e 'p [Encoding.default_internal, Encoding.default_external]'` on the command line?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/comments/10241864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/comments/14090847","html_url":"https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/1#issuecomment-14090847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/1","id":14090847,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDkwODQ3","user":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-26T03:40:17Z","updated_at":"2013-02-26T03:40:17Z","body":"Closing

\r\nhttps://github.com/lunelson/sass-list-maps\r\n\r\nThe following example says it all:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$list-map-z: (\r\n  alpha (\r\n    beta (\r\n      gamma 3\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\n.demo {\r\n  out: map-get-z($list-map-z, alpha); // -> ( beta ( gamma 3 ) )\r\n  out: map-get-z($list-map-z, alpha, beta); // -> ( gamma 3 )\r\n  out: map-get-z($list-map-z, alpha, beta, gamma); // -> 3\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFACT: Up to a point, even when using maps extended naming conventions come into play. Using `map-get-z` we can actually use structure to categorize versus naming conventions. I vote for structure every time. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$carousel: (\r\n  color (\r\n    header (\r\n      border gray,\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\n$side-nav: (\r\n  bg gray,\r\n  color (\r\n    hover (\r\n      search yellow,\r\n      home red,\r\n      filter blue\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\nblock {\r\n  color: map-get-z($side-nav, color, hover, filter);\r\n}\r\n\r\nblock {\r\n  border-color: map-get-z($carousel, color, header, border);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't mind using the plug-in, but I think that this is a feature that Sass should support natively.
