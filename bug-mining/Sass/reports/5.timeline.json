Yes, if you use `@extend` a lot on the same selector, that selector will expand a lot. I think `@extend` works in a reasonably predictable way and this is a reasonably predictable consequence. It's definitely unfortunate that browsers can't handle long selectors, but there's not really a great way to shorten them here. I suppose one suggestion I have is to avoid using `@extend` in nested selectors in areas where you have problems.\n\nI'm closing this because it's not really a bug report or feature request.
