Consider the following.\n# divParent {\n\n```\ncolor:red;\n#divChild {\n    -moz-transform:scale(1.05);\n    &prepend(.ie8) {\n        width:105%;\n        height:105%;\n        position:relative;\n        top:-5px;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n}\n\nEssentially, I'd like to be able to prepend specific CSS hooks (e.g. for IE or browsers that don't support a given CSS3 property) but I would have to do those in their own separate nested style tree. Are you following me here? If I'm not making myself clear and this looks interesting to you, shoot me an email at stklein89@gmail.com and I'd be happy to talk about it further.\n","closed_by":{"login":"stevenklein","id":244793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDc5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/244793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenklein","html_url":"https://github.com/stevenklein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenklein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenklein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenklein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenklein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenklein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenklein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenklein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenklein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevenklein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/58/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/58/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
