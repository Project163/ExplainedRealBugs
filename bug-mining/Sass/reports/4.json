I get : \nlib/sass/plugin/rails.rb:19: undefined method `reverse_merge!' for nil:NilClass\n- instead.\n\nTurns out that RubyInline defines \"attr_reader :options\" on the Module object.  This then prevents Sass::Plugin's method_missing magic from forwarding Sass::Plugin.options to the compiler, and it just returns nil instead.\n\nAny thoughts on a workaround?\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/16/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
