My situation is an extended version of that... I work on Sencha Touch, and all of our theming is based on SASS/Compass. We have lots of variables and mixins, but ultimately it is possible to change the entire theme from just a few global variables. Take, for example, our upcoming Apple and Android themes: \n- http://cl.ly/e028f476ffe3564542be\n- http://cl.ly/59d19bb55b1864ab0ef8\n\nAnd, for reference, here is what some of our SASS/Compass looks like:\n- http://cl.ly/f9e4afaab4d2b184d5b0\n\nExcept, if we declare #555 for our default color (which would be great to do a metal theme, similar to iPad UI or jQuery Mobile), parts of the app look like this:\n\nhttp://cl.ly/3d60c233a95c975d511d\n\nKeep in mind, if they were to specify a green value, their app would simply look like:\n\nhttp://cl.ly/3d3f4b468c5f5e691428\n\nPersonal taste aside, I think it's just not expected to the users. To get around it, I would have to abstract every place that uses saturate in my SCSS files (there are a lot more than just the variables file). And as the last part of my rant, I'll just say, saturating in Photoshop or Illustrator would never turn a gray to red.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/comments/445382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidkaneda","id":21713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkaneda","html_url":"https://github.com/davidkaneda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkaneda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkaneda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkaneda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkaneda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkaneda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkaneda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkaneda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkaneda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidkaneda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/comments/445436","html_url":"https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/11#issuecomment-445436","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/11","id":445436,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NTQzNg==","user":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-10-04T00:00:53Z","updated_at":"2010-10-04T00:00:53Z","body":"I'll consider making Sass behave the same way as photoshop -- that is, making `saturate()` always a no-op on colors with 0 saturation.
