Proposal: \r\nAdd a try/catch operator to sass to handle `@error` directives more cleanly without hard compiler crashes.\r\n\r\n## Use Case\r\nAs a developer, I'd like to be able to write test code to cover my sass functions. I'm unable to test all branches of my code as my `node-sass` compiler crashes if it reaches an `@error` directive. While I am glad that the `@error` worked as intended and crashed while I was using the function, I'd like to be able to catch the exception during \"test\" mode and make an assertion about the message that was thrown.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/oddbird/true/issues/92 for an example.\r\n\r\n### Side comments\r\nWith `sass` as popular as it is, and new sass code being written every day, I find that the number of projects that I've worked on without tests for functional code to be high. Testing is necessary for maintenance and confidence in code. As sass is becoming a de-facto \"language\" for writing stylesheets, it seems that the `@error` operator necessitates a partnering try/catch directive. Even if `@error` is a weakly typed error, and try/catch doesn't have exception types, having the ability to catch an exception and handle it (if only for testing purposes) allows me to be confident that the code that I write is working the way I intend. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/2596/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/2596/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9263472383,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAA4wNc4ACz9bzwAAAAIoJV7_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/9263472383","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ebfe9a652c2e5be0fdaa54b9cce14cca07232e93","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/commits/ebfe9a652c2e5be0fdaa54b9cce14cca07232e93","created_at":"2023-05-17T00:25:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
