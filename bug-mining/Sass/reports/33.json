This matches the visibility of members, but it also causes some problems once you get into the weeds of an implementation. It's no longer the case that a module has a single clear set of upstream modules that provide CSS. Instead, it has upstream modules it can extend, and upstream modules it can't. This makes internal representations more complex. It also runs the risk of confusing users who may expect `@forward` to behave the same as `@use` with regard to CSS, because that's true for everything other than `@extend`.\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear how useful this lack of visibility is in the first place. `@forward` is a feature designed for use with members, not with top-level CSS. Users are unlikely to care one way or another whether `@forward`ed CSS can be `@extend`ed because that's not what `@forward` is for. So going with semantics that produce a simpler implementation has a lot of benefit.","closed_by":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/2697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/2697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
