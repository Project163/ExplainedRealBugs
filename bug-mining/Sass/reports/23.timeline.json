The idea behind this is that a component might be added to the project as a third-party component and I'll want to import their CSS for use in Sass.\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to have project in Bower (and other package managers) for reusable CSS components that would work with or without Sass. Take the Normalize.css file for example, I would like to be able to add this to a project using Bower and import it into the project as I would an SCSS file rather than creating a vanilla CSS import.\r\n\r\nI imagine this would mean letting this syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@import \"normalize\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nlook for `normalize.sass`, `normalise.scss` or `normalize.css` and pull it in. Currently it will ignore it if it only finds a css file.\r\n\r\nWould there be any downsides to this?\r\n\r\n/cc @chriseppstein

extensions are currently ruby based. This was all well and good while we only had one implementation but with libsass in the mix, there is no way to introduce sass extensions that can work everywhere. The ruby extensions syntax is highly dependent on the specifics of the ruby implementation. I see a couple options:\n1. Define a way to create extensions that support implementation specific code. For libsass this would be a shared object file and some way to initialize it. For ruby this would be much like what we have right now.\n2. Choose a highly interoperable language for writing sass extensions and a common API in that language that all implementations would need to support. The most likely candidate for this is probably Lua. It is lightweight, fast, and fairly easy to write code in.\n\nIn addition to the extension support, I think it would be good for code that depends on extensions to make that dependency explicit using some special directive in the sass file itself. This could be as simple as letting `@import` (or some sass 4.0 equivalent) refer to sass \"extensions\" (since conceptually they define functions not unlike a sass file could). Or we could introduce some new directive for this.\n\n/cc @akhleung @hcatlin @xzyfer\n\nThis is a major hurdle for making compass cross-implementation

\r\nhttps://github.com/lunelson/sass-list-maps\r\n\r\nThe following example says it all:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$list-map-z: (\r\n  alpha (\r\n    beta (\r\n      gamma 3\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\n.demo {\r\n  out: map-get-z($list-map-z, alpha); // -> ( beta ( gamma 3 ) )\r\n  out: map-get-z($list-map-z, alpha, beta); // -> ( gamma 3 )\r\n  out: map-get-z($list-map-z, alpha, beta, gamma); // -> 3\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFACT: Up to a point, even when using maps extended naming conventions come into play. Using `map-get-z` we can actually use structure to categorize versus naming conventions. I vote for structure every time. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$carousel: (\r\n  color (\r\n    header (\r\n      border gray,\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\n$side-nav: (\r\n  bg gray,\r\n  color (\r\n    hover (\r\n      search yellow,\r\n      home red,\r\n      filter blue\r\n    )\r\n  )\r\n);\r\n\r\nblock {\r\n  color: map-get-z($side-nav, color, hover, filter);\r\n}\r\n\r\nblock {\r\n  border-color: map-get-z($carousel, color, header, border);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't mind using the plug-in, but I think that this is a feature that Sass should support natively.
