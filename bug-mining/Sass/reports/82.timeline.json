[CSS Nesting specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting/) is moving quickly towards a First Public Working Draft, and potential implementation. We have some time before it will stabilize and land in browsers, but there is a lot of syntax overlap with some key differences in output. I wanted to document some of the ways it will conflict with (and give different results compared to) Sass nesting.\r\n\r\nThe spec is based very much on our feature, using the same `&` syntax, but adjusted to ensure that browsers only need single-character look-ahead. That means:\r\n\r\n1. Every nested selector requires the `&` parent reference\r\n2. Our syntax is supported directly _when the nested selector starts with_ `&`\r\n\r\n## Sass-only\r\n\r\nThere are a few use cases we support, but CSS does not:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.block {\r\n  p { … } /* CSS requires the implied & prefix for a descendant combinator */\r\n  main & { … } /* CSS requires & to be the first character for this syntax */\r\n  &_element { … } /* CSS does not support string-concatenation */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## CSS-only\r\n\r\nCSS provides a second syntax that has no current meaning with Sass. The `@nest` rule allows more complex combinations, while still avoiding infinite-lookahead.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* required in cases such as… */\r\n.block {\r\n  @nest main & { … }\r\n  @nest :not(&) { … }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* optional in some cases… */\r\n.block {\r\n  @nest & p { … }\r\n  @nest &.active { … }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## CSS/Sass overlap\r\n\r\nThen there are some rules supported by both Sass & CSS syntax, such as:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.foo, .bar {\r\n  color: blue;\r\n  & + .baz, &.qux { color: red; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.foo {\r\n  color: blue;\r\n  & .bar & .baz & .qux { color: red; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile the syntax is the same, these cases are interpreted in slightly different ways. Sass generates all the possible combinations:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.foo, .bar { color: blue; }\r\n.foo + .baz, \r\n.foo.qux, \r\n.bar + .baz, \r\n.bar.qux { color: red; }\r\n\r\n.foo { color: blue; }\r\n.foo .bar .foo .baz .foo .qux { color: red; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile CSS relies on the `:is()` selector for a simpler reading:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n   .foo, .bar { color: blue; }\r\n   :is(.foo, .bar) + .baz,\r\n   :is(.foo, .bar).qux { color: red; }\r\n\r\n   .foo { color: blue; }\r\n   .foo .bar .foo .baz .foo .qux { color: blue; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn those examples the output has a different structure, but generally the same meaning – both in terms of _matching_ and _specificity_. But there are some cases where the specificity is significantly different. The `:is()` pseudoclass takes on the _highest specificity of any selector inside it_, even if that selector is not matched. Compiled selector lists, on the other hand, take the specificity of the _highest matching selector_. For example:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.error, #e404 {\r\n  & > .baz { color: red; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn CSS, this is equivalent to:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:is(.error, #e404) > .baz /* specificity: [1, 1, 0] */\r\n{ color: red; }\r\n ```\r\n\r\nWhile Sass generates:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.error > .baz, /* specificity: [0, 2, 0] */\r\n#e404 > .baz /* specificity: [1, 1, 0] */\r\n{ color: red; }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Thoughts...\r\n\r\nWe don't generally add internal functionality around new CSS features before they have been implemented by several browsers – but the overlapped-syntax-with-different-meaning use-cases could cause a problem here.\r\n\r\n- Uses of `@nest` can likely be passed through without modifications\r\n  - It might be possible short-term to require `@nest` as a marker for accessing the native CSS feature?\r\n  - Long-term we will need to define how this syntax integrates (or doesn't) with our selector functions\r\n- At some point we'll need to change our output to use `:is()` or pass-through/generate the appropriate CSS nesting syntax\r\n  - In some cases that can happen smoothly without any change for authors\r\n  - In some cases that will be a specificity-breaking change\r\n- For Sass-only syntax, we have to decide what CSS is generated in each case\r\n  - Implicit ancestor `&` could be added to the output or compiled according to the spec\r\n  - Non `&`-prefixed selectors could add `@nest` to the output, or be compiled according to spec\r\n  - We could continue to compile concatenation basically as-is?\r\n\r\nI've likely missed some things here, but thought it was worth starting the conversation.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/3030/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":10,"rocket":0,"eyes":4},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/3030/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12566814498,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAA4wNc6Gi0kDzwAAAALtCl8i","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/12566814498","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"dd7c6beecc2c9c93e15937b42c0c00438f1f564e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/commits/dd7c6beecc2c9c93e15937b42c0c00438f1f564e","created_at":"2024-04-22T23:09:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12566854513,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAA4wNc6Gi0kDzwAAAALtCvtx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/12566854513","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b05a4169a8ab7f2f1eaeed213c7d36bd03e1738a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/commits/b05a4169a8ab7f2f1eaeed213c7d36bd03e1738a","created_at":"2024-04-22T23:15:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12583711519,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAA4wNc6Gi0kDzwAAAALuDDMf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/12583711519","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a1f1c8de741480488d909f00530932ee2ac362d9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/commits/a1f1c8de741480488d909f00530932ee2ac362d9","created_at":"2024-04-24T01:17:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12664191131,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAA4wNc6Gi0kDzwAAAALy2Dib","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/12664191131","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.githu

know it was a design choice to put nested rules below the parent rule, regardless of source ordering, and I vaguely remember it being about reducing bloat. However, to me it doesn't follow the principle of least surprise: I would expect it to follow the ordering I chose. In cases like\n\n``` scss\n.parent {\n  margin: 1em 0;\n  .child { padding: 1em; }\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nMy expected output would be\n\n``` css\n.parent { margin: 1em 0; }\n.parent .child { padding: 1em; }\n.parent { color: red; }\n```\n\nwhich duplicates the `.parent` selector, I know. But I feel like that should be my choice, so I can order my selectors in a predictable fashion. It can cause cascade surprises, especially when I'm doing something like this:\n\n``` scss\n@mixin reset-link-styles {\n  &, &:visited, &:hover, &:active {\n    text-decoration: none;\n    color: inherit;\n    // etc...\n  }\n}\n.class {\n  @include reset-link-styles;\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nWhich unexpectedly puts the reset below the `color: red`, nullifying that declaration.\n\nI've also noticed that it still reorders even when the child selector isn't preceded by any styles pertaining to the parent class, as in:\n\n``` scss\n.class1 {\n  .class2 { color: green; }\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\nEven though `.class2` isn't at risk of breaking `.class1` in half, it still gets output afterwards.\n\nI realise that this is a subtle issue that requires careful thought, so I'm not expecting anyone to say \"oh, we'll change that right away sir\" -- just wanted to post my thoughts and inspire some conversation. I've got a workaround for the reset example -- putting all the styles that should appear afterwards in their own `&` selector:\n\n``` scss\n.class {\n  @include reset-link-styles;\n  & { color: red; }\n}\n```\n\nbut it feels finicky.\n\nMy inclination would be to dispense with optimisation and leave that responsibility to users, but I realise I'm just one user among many, some of whom might appreciate this feature!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/1243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/1243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"duplicate"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19398190427,"node_id":"MADE_lADOAA4wNc6Gi0kDzwAAAASEOOVb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/19398190427","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"marked_as_duplicate","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-28T19:21:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19399909076,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAA4wNc6Gi0kDzwAAAASEUx7U","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/19399909076","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bdc364058a87c1181f3170884713414438a092e4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/commits/bdc364058a87c1181f3170884713414438a092e4","created_at":"2025-08-28T21:19:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-28T21:19:26Z","updated_at":"2025-08-28T21:19:26Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/4123","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/4123/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/4123/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/4123/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sass/sass/pull/4123","id":3364713114,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAA4wNc6l4Vx2","number":4123,"title":"Update
