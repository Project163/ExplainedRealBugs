also raises the question for _when_ we should allow users to construct these values. It's clear per the CSS spec that `lab(110% 0 0)` should be clamped, and clear that `color.to-space(color(xyz 1 1 1), lab)` _should not_ be clamped, but what about like `color.change(lab(0% 0 0), $lightness: 110%)`? If we _don't_ allow that, what do we do with `color.change(color.to-space(color(xyz 1 1 1), lab), $a: 50%)`, since it already has an out-of-gamut lightness and that's not being explicitly changed?\r\n\r\n@mirisuzanne I'm interested in your design thoughts here. I think I'm leaning towards allowing `color.change()` _et al_ to produce out-of-gamut colors—basically going with the design principle that we never clamp except where the CSS spec explicitly mandates clamping. But I'm not strongly convinced of that yet.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/comments/1802716811/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10906069852,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAA4wNc511hUCzwAAAAKKDWtc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/10906069852","actor":{"login":"mirisuzanne","id":104161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDE2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne","html_url":"https://github.com/mirisuzanne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-08T21:35:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10906069869,"node_id":"SE_lADOAA4wNc511hUCzwAAAAKKDWtt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/10906069869","actor":{"login":"mirisuzanne","id":104161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDE2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne","html_url":"https://github.com/mirisuzanne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-08T21:35:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/comments/1804375991","html_url":"https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/3737#issuecomment-1804375991","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/3737","id":1804375991,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAA4wNc5rjJe3","user":{"login":"mirisuzanne","id":104161,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDE2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104161?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne","html_url":"https://github.com/mirisuzanne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mirisuzanne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-09T18:44:10Z","updated_at":"2023-11-09T18:44:10Z","body":"That's

possible for a color conversion to result in negative lightness. For example, the color `lab(1% 60 100)` is naively equivalent to `oklab(-4.8743815325% 0.7106198377 0.1847214228)`.
