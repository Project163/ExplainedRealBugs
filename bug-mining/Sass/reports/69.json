With this change, both host, and compiler would be able to pass raw proto to a thread/isolate that is currently working on a specific compilation, and the decoding of the proto can happen on the child thread's CPU cycle, giving the main thread more free CPU cycle to purely process multiplexed I/O.\r\n\r\n`session_id` should be in the range of `uint32`, the reason to choose `varint` as its encoding instead is:\r\n\r\n1. For most of cases it would be shorter\r\n2. Avoid the possible confusion on endianness of uint32 on wire.","closed_by":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/3579/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/3579/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
