The second point there looks wrong to me, and like it might be leftover from a previous draft of the CSS spec? The `(hue % 360deg)` part is harmless, but already handled in the linked pseudocode for conversion. However, I can't find any reason to divide by `60` given the current conversion functions. It seems like that should be removed?
