(2022-04-27)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- [x] **button:** update HCM shim to use the existing focus-ring ([a657abb](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/a657abb61a2c7d23c2bd92c3cbd54ed404d0bafe))\r\n> @Kiarokh: Does not seem relevant for us now, as we do our own focus ring, using our own mixins. However, it seems they have some strategies for handling high-contrast mode, which is something we should also consider doing in future.\r\n- [x] * **checkbox:** Add explicit system color for checkmark in HCM. ([8c4da22](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/8c4da223a7d35c4ca0a4f27534ecdb13087d0f1b))\r\n- [x] * **checkbox:** move forced-colors theme out of static styles ([bbd1126](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/bbd11268f0ea4fd45205a642f1d26a4c4ff34e05))\r\n- [x] * **checkbox:** Update checkbox theme styles mixin to accept css vars ([c14e977](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/c14e977ee36c26074b04dea5ce37e2300e9d3735))\r\n> @Kiarokh: it seems this is all about the new `focus-ring` which we already have, and some theming like the previous one. We need to check these separately and have a good theming strategy.\r\n\r\n- [x] * **chips:** Fix typography selector in GMDC-Wiz chips theming ([43c7d87](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/43c7d87dc0c928d74652ceaebebca51c69b6eaaf))\r\n> @Kiarokh: we are still using `@use '@material/chips/deprecated/mdc-chips';` I think because we need the chips to act as links (`<a />`) in the CRM. So this doesn't concern us right now.\r\n\r\n- [x] * **datatable:** Adjust data table last row border-radius to support setting row background-color. ([ba78e87](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/ba78e87246af31e1fe7dd03241a7565f2892fd64))\r\n> @Kiarokh: we don't have it\r\n\r\n- [ ] * **dialog:** Render dividers in Firefox 94 on Windows HCM ([fae6c65](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/fae6c652d7debc3e2875ab9049d806513ddc2421))\r\n- [ ] * **dialog:** Set default z-index for close button in FloatingSheet dialog. ([3366a71](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/3366a71d72f48e946a3f3b314b315395fafb3a1f))\r\n\r\n- [x] * **fab:** Add focus ring in HCM. ([d57ec74](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/d57ec74c7e9afe5db07162202e6f05b28dd581db))\r\n> @Kiarokh: we don't have it\r\n\r\n- [x] * **focus-ring:** add 2d padding customizability, RTL bugfix ([f81fb1d](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/f81fb1d232901c17d5794499c26e746ccab1af19))\r\n- [x] * **focus-ring:** box-sizing bugfix to content-box. If box-sizing border-box is inherited the ring spacing will collapse. ([e58552c](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/e58552c6efa0442a36f441efe27cd01f3df2a524))\r\n- [x] * **focus-ring:** ignore pointer events ([3ef470e](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/3ef470efe6f1d213935dca37ad213030cdd30d88))\r\n- [x] * **focus-ring:** RTL bugfix ([e00181e](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/e00181e59cb1f29f4a8280f48b377a667a3e783b))\r\n> @Kiarokh: we don't use this\r\n\r\n- [x] * **iconbutton:** Fixed max width and height for high contrast mode focus ring on icon buttons. Display only in forced colors mode. ([cf42927](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/cf429277817af685fd0b23a21a2e10ddabc4b9ef))\r\n- [x] * **iconbutton:** Set icon button ripple z-index to -1. ([586e740](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/586e740ddcaa674c409d68ab5faf9ee8c61e2d91))\r\n> @Kiarokh: we don't use ripple on icon button anymore; and don't use focus ring\r\n\r\n- [x] * **list:** Improve a11y for multi-select lists ([9736ddc](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/9736ddce9c12f5485e746984225919568541e88d))\r\n- [x] * **list:** Remove conflicting validation for checkbox list in setEnabled ([353ca7e](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/353ca7e9f21b3589a17d25d8892198cba811dd13))\r\n- [x] * **list:** Update lastSelectedIndex when toggling a checkbox range ([dcba26f](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/dcba26fe1028cf151ebf34c5947082a49cc85f10))\r\n> @Kiarokh: as far as I understand and tested, these have no effect on us\r\n\r\n- [ ] * **menusurface:** Add a getOwnerDocument() method to MDCMenuSurfaceAdapter to provide a reference to the document that owns the menu surface DOM element. ([3486659](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/348665978ce73694ad4518626dd70cdf5b984113))\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] * **radio:** Fix disabled state in Firefox Windows high contrast mode ([23043ac](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/23043acd0e5341729230cc6e1840460977056115))\r\n- [x] * **radio:** Modify theme styles Sass mixin validation to validate only keys ([390220e](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/390220e422be57e8f38b74e04d8e8aba6082d333))\r\n> @Kiarokh: we only use radio buttons in `limel-list`, and there everything seems to work like before.\r\n\r\n- [x] * **select:** Add border to select menu in HCM. ([5d80969](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/5d809696c6699bf9563e8faf8f79ff6ebd78febf))\r\n- [x] * **select:** revert down/up arrow on anchor changing selected index ([43d08ba](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/43d08ba77e44dffbca99194ee18dbd202c8684f7))\r\n> @Kiarokh: we don't use this HCM (the focus ring), and I couldn't see any difference for the second fix.\r\n\r\n- [x] * **slider:** Fix bug where secondary click moves slider thumb. ([3ab9565](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/3ab956515feb5c861498b156e68493e6f7f2a578))\r\n- [x] * **slider:** Fix IE11 bug - `unset` is unsupported in IE. ([f460e23](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/f460e23dae619c6d09de114cc8c319972b7d1b10))\r\n- [x] * **slider:** In updateUI, fix behavior to match jsdoc claim that when thumb param is undefined it updates both thumbs. Input attributes were not being updated at all. ([cc4ed13](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/commit/cc4ed13ccda7b44edce0070edd6ee215e98cc792))\r\n- [x] * **slider:** Make the slider errors easier to debug by providing all relevant values in the error message.
