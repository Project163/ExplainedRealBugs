This more closely matches the existing `@import` behavior and so should make migration easier, it makes `@extend`s work the same within a module as they do across modules, and it's easier for users to disable optimization (by manually writing all selectors in the module) than it would be to force optimization if we decided to disable it by default in this case.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/comments/465371045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2254886172,"node_id":"MDE2OlRyYW5zZmVycmVkRXZlbnQyMjU0ODg2MTcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/2254886172","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"transferred","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-05T06:18:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2254889598,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyNTQ4ODk1OTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/2254889598","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-05T06:20:54Z","label":{"name":"proposal:
