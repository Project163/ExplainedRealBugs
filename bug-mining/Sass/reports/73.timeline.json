I see two feasible solutions here:\r\n\r\n1. Keep the behavior as-is, and continue parsing `//` as an inline comment wherever it appears. This violates our core design principle of CSS compatibility.\r\n\r\n2. Parse `//` in an expression context as a slash-separated list with an empty value in the middle. This would be _hugely_ backwards-incompatible, since `//` is already widely used in expression contexts to begin a single-line comment.\r\n\r\nEither one of these is very bad. I'll talk to some CSSWG folks about this, but my initial inclination is to go with option 1, and say you _must_ include the space between the slashes in Sass. The migration cost for option 2 would be quite substantial, and we're already asking a lot of our users with the `/`-as-division migration and the module system migration.\r\n\r\nSeparately, this means we'll need to do two more things:\r\n\r\n- [x] Update the `/`-as-separator spec to support empty elements.\r\n- [x] Update the plain-CSS parser to support `//` in expression contexts.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/comments/1977703796/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12006349068,"node_id":"AE_lADOAA4wNc6BNUmizwAAAALLolkM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/12006349068","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-05T00:07:02Z","assignee":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12006349997,"node_id":"LE_lADOAA4wNc6BNUmizwAAAALLolyt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/12006349997","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-05T00:07:10Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12006350001,"node_id":"LE_lADOAA4wNc6BNUmizwAAAALLolyx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/12006350001","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","
