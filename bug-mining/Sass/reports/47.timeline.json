I'm not opposed to the idea of using `is` and `is not`, but I do have two hesitations. First, I feel like having a more programmery punctuation-heavy operator calls attention to the fact that this is doing something different than CSS (although since boolean operations universally happen in the context of `@if` or possibly variable assignment, that's somewhat less relevant). The other worry I have is that this isn't a big enough issue that the cost of migrating existing stylesheets is outweighed by the benefit of the new syntax. I'm certainly not convinced of that, though.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/comments/558379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/comments/559007","html_url":"https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/25#issuecomment-559007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/25","id":559007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1OTAwNw==","user":{"login":"chriseppstein","id":1839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein","html_url":"https://github.com/chriseppstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chriseppstein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-11-22T15:24:44Z","updated_at":"2010-11-22T15:24:44Z","body":"All I can say is something inside me cringes when I type == and != in a sass file.

some cases, it would be useful to use logical operators in `@if` (and anywhere else).\n\nE.g.:\n\n``` scss\n@if var1 == \"foo\" and var2 == \"bar\" {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nDepending of what is decided here: https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/25 we could use `and` and/or `&&`, `or` and/or `||`, etc.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/1059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/1059/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/comments/31630901","html_url":"https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/25#issuecomment-31630901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/25","id":31630901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNjMwOTAx","user":{"login":"borodean","id":1530865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzA4NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1530865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodean","html_url":"https://github.com/borodean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/borodean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-06T07:02:42Z","updated_at":"2014-01-06T07:02:42Z","body":"CoffeeScript
