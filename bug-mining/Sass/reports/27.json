In particular, are an upstream module's selectors considered \"original\" when being extended by downstream modules, even when they were generated by extensions within that module?\r\n\r\nLet's look at a concrete example:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n// upstream.scss\r\n.a.x {a: b}\r\n.b.c {@extend .x}\"\r\n\r\n// downstream.scss\r\n@use \"upstream\";\r\n.c {@extend .x}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`upstream.scss`'s module CSS is\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.a.x, .a.b.c {a: b}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce it's extended by `downstream.scss`, before any selectors are trimmed, it becomes:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.a.x, .a.b.c, .a.c {a: b}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe question is, *can we optimize away `.a.b.c` here`*?\r\n\r\nIf all three selectors were in the same file, the answer would clearly be \"yes\". `.a.b.c` is a generated selector that's a subselector of `.a.c`, so it can be removed. But if we make the same decision across module boundaries, that introduces a case where it doesn't just matter what a module's CSS is, it matters *how that CSS was generated*. This is something we explicitly decided to avoid in other design decisions; see [the note on why `@extend` doesn't affect downstream modules](https://github.com/sass/language/blob/master/accepted/module-system.md#resolving-extensions).\r\n\r\nThat said, I still think there's a strong argument for allowing `.a.b.c` to be removed. Unlike downstream extensions, this is an *optimization*. That's the entire reason we trim selectors in the first place. The laws of extend are designed to serve as heuristics for when a given selector is \"intended\", as well as guidelines for our users as to what they can rely on. In this case they're suggesting that the extra specificity in `.a.b.c` wasn't intended, so I think it's probably safe to remove.","closed_by":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/2652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/2652/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
