Sass insists that all indentation in a file be completely consistent. However, this means that it's not possible to get rid of a line without re-indenting everything beneath it, which is annoying when debugging code.\n\nWe want to allow variable indentation as long as it's unambiguous. For example, the following:\n\n```\nfoo\n  bar\n      baz\n        bang: bop\n      boom: bip\n```\n\nshould be the same as\n\n```\nfoo\n  bar\n    baz\n      bang: bop\n    boom: bip\n```\n\nHowever, wherever we currently would raise an error, a warning should be printed.\n\nAmbiguous cases should still be marked as erroneous. For example, the following\n\n```\nfoo\n    up: four spaces\n  down: two spaces\n```\n\nshould raise an error on the \"down: two spaces\" line.\n\nThis is conceptually the same as issue #28, but since Sass and Haml don't share parser code, they're listed separately.\n\n[Originally filed](https://github.com/nex3/haml/issues/29) by @nex3.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/113/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9263472088,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAA4wNc4ABrZjzwAAAAIoJV3Y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/events/9263472088","actor":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"418b9f0673c3c47fa39a931fdf4713662c68ba6d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/commits/418b9f0673c3c47fa39a931fdf4713662c68ba6d","created_at":"2023-05-17T00:25:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
