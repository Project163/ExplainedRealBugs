In addition, the Resolving Extensions procedure only traverses the module graph, which doesn't include `@import`s, so that CSS isn't included at all (unless that module is used again elsewhere).\r\n\r\nThis raises the additional question of what should happen if a *nested* import transitively imports a `@use`. In order to ensure that the used module's (transitive) CSS is only loaded once, it can't be nested; but in order to ensure that the use of `@use` is transparent to downstream stylesheets, it needs to be nested. A design decision is needed here. I personally lean towards loading imported CSS multiple times (using similar machinery as for `load-css()`), since anyone using `@import` is already living in a multi-load world.","closed_by":{"login":"nex3","id":188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3","html_url":"https://github.com/nex3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nex3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/2666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sass/sass/issues/2666/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
