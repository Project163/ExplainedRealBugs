current plan:**\n\n1. Create an automated migration tool that can migrate users from `/`-as-division to a `divide()` function.\n2. Deprecate `/`-as-division. Any time a `/` would be interpreted unambiguously as division, or an ambiguous `/` would be made unambiguous (for example by being stored in a variable), we produce a deprecation warning .\n3. Add a top-level `divide()` function (`math.div()` in the new module system). This will work exactly the same way division works today, with the obvious exception that it will never be treated as a slash separator.\n4. Add a new slash-separated list type to represent slash as a separator. For the time being, this will not have a literal syntax.\n5. Add a `slash-list()` function (`list.slash()` in the new module system) that returns a slash-separated list. Providing the ability to work with slash-separated lists even before they have a literal syntax will help stylesheets be forwards-compatible with the new wold.\n6. Wait until at least three months after the module system is released.\n7. Release Dart Sass 2.0.0, which parses `/` as a list separator that binds more loosely than space but more tightly than comma.\n8. Add support for [first class `calc()`](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/2186), which will allow `/`-as-division in the form of `calc(5px / 2)`.\n8. Deprecate the `slash-list()`/`list.slash()` function in favor of using the literal syntax.\n9.

Because this was a relatively narrow edge case, we were able to use `/` as the division operator as well, with [some heuristics](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#division-and-slash) to decide between them. When `/` was used as a separator, the value it produced was actually the divided number, but it was *rendered* with the slash instead.\n\nHowever, the slash separator has been seeing more use in recent CSS specs. The [`grid-row`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-row) property uses it to separate values for `grid-row-start` and `grid-row-end`, and [Colors Level 4](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/) uses it in many color functions (including the new recommended syntax for `rgb()` and `hsl()`) to separate the alpha value from the rest of the parameters.\n\nThe increased prominence of this syntax means that the sharp edges of the heuristics we use to distinguish between `/`-as-separator and `/`-as-division will start cutting more users. Once Sass supports the new color function syntax (https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/2564), users are likely to try passing the alpha by variable, which will currently fail. We need to decide whether to do something about this, and if so, what.\n\n## How do we represent division?\n\nToday, division is represented by the operator `/`, which as discussed above is ambiguous. We could fairly easily add a new syntax for this, which would allow us to migrate users away from `/`, eventually leaving it as unambiguously a separator.\n\nI see a few options for this:\n\n* Keep the behavior as-is. This has the substantial benefit of requiring no migration, and it will be sufficient to support compatibility with plain CSS. However, it will make it much more painful for users to use dynamic alpha values for their colors as the new color function syntax gains traction.\n\n* Replace the `/` operator with another operator. There's no option that's really consistent with other programming languages, but `~` is a possibility that's currently unused and looks a *little* like ÷.\nhttps://github.com/sass/sass/issues/2565\n* Replace the `/` operator with a function, such as `div()`. This is more verbose, but it's very clear to the reader and it avoids any risk of further collision with new CSS syntax.\n\n## What is a slash separator?\n\nIf we do decide to free up `/` to unambiguously represent a separator, we need to figure out how that separator works in terms of SassScript. This is particularly tricky because its scope varies from property to property. In `font`, it's *tightly bound*--the slash in `italic small-caps bold 16px/2 cursive` separates `16px` from `2`, but it *doesn't* separate `italic small-caps bold 16px` from `2 cursive`. However, in `grid-row` and the color functions, it's *loosely bound*--the slash in `rgb(1 2 3 / 0.5)` separates `1 2 3` from `0.5`, and is not bound to `3` in particular.\n\nI think it makes sense in general to consider `/` another kind of list separator, so that it works smoothly with existing APIs. But because of the scoping differences it's not clear whether it should bind more tightly than space-separated lists or not.

v2 is out!** Read our [announcement](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/discussions/9734).\r\n\r\n## Is v2 stable?\r\n\r\n**YES**\r\n\r\n## The plan\r\n\r\nOur main focus at the moment is shipping Quasar v2 with Vue v3.\r\nThe plan is to **not introduce any breaking changes**, unless forced by the vue 3 / vue-router 4 architectures.\r\n\r\nAffected Quasar packages: \"quasar\", \"@quasar/app\".\r\n\r\n## Rough schedule\r\n\r\n* First beta: \"quasar\" v2.0.0-beta.1 & \"@quasar/app\" v3.0.0-beta.1 - **Jan 2021**\r\n* Stable releases: \"quasar\" v2.0.0 & \"@quasar/app\" v3.0.0 - **Q2 2021**\r\n\r\n## The code\r\n\r\nThe branch currently holding Quasar v2 is called [dev](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/tree/dev) (was previously `vue3-work`).\r\n\r\n## Donations\r\n\r\nIf you want to speed up the development of Quasar please consider donating to the project. With proper funding, it allows more of the team to work on the project in a much more dedicated manner.\r\n\r\n[Donations - https://donate.quasar.dev](https://donate.quasar.dev)\r\n\r\nIf you're in a company and using Quasar for commercial projects, explain to your management the importance of monthly donations (eg. $200+) for open source projects: you're the one using it every day and this makes you the best suited person to convince them. Be creative! :slight_smile:\r\n\r\nQuasar is saving your company tens of thousands of development hours (quite literally), which in turn is a pretty high money savings. Consider giving back a part of those savings to refuel the project itself :wink:\r\n\r\n## Update: June 21st 2021\r\n\r\nQuasar v2 stable (with Vue.js 3) has been released! Time to party!\r\nhttps://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/discussions/9734\r\n\r\n## Update: June 19th 2021\r\n\r\nNext release is v2.0.0 stable.\r\nBranch `vue3-work` has been merged into `dev`. The Qv1 work will now be done exclusively on the new `v1` branch.\r\n\r\n## Update: April 27th 2021\r\nWe have passed the final major milestone: Quasar CLI now ships with Webpack 5, which was badly needed to support Node 13+. Faster build speeds and lower memory usage.\r\nWe're just a few small steps away from getting Quasar v2 out of beta!\r\n\r\n## Update: April 4th 2021\r\nThe last Quasar CLI mode left to be enabled, which is SSR, is now also available.\r\nHere is the link to the [upgrade guide](https://next.quasar.dev/quasar-cli/developing-ssr/ssr-upgrade-guide) on SSR.\r\nWe are targeting for a 2 weeks testing period for SSR mode then we will release the official stable version of Quasar v2.\r\n\r\n## Update: February 16th 2021\r\n\r\nWe're close to the stable release. The only thing remaining is the SSR support. Quasar is SSR ready, however we're only going to enable SSR support as soon as these Vue3 SSR bugs (critical for us and your experience) are solved:\r\n* ~https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/issues/3244~ redirected to https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/issues/2863\r\n* https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/issues/2386\r\n* https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/issues/3245\r\n* https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/issues/3243\r\n* https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/issues/3255\r\n\r\n## Update: February 10th 2021\r\n\r\nSSR mode is ready (UI and CLI-wise) to be released. Unfortunately, there are quite a few Vue SSR bugs that need to be fixed before we enable the build mode for Quasar v2. We are in the process of reporting them and we'll start collaborating with the Vue team to help fix them.\r\n\r\n## Update: January 11th 2021\r\n\r\nHi All,\r\n\r\nThere are still some things being worked on for Quasar v2, but mainly we're now writing the migration guide. Our target for release of the public beta is within January 2021. The new version is based on Composition API. But it's not just a port to Vue 3. _There are lots of significant performance enhancements in Quasar's algorithms too!_ **You'll love it!**\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the first beta release won't include SSR support, due to missing some upstream features in Vue 3, which we'll contribute to via PRs. We'll release SSR support during the beta stage lifecycle though.\r\n\r\nWe're also trying to integrate Webpack 5 support into the `@quasar/app` v3 release, but if we are unable to get this done (ie: external dependencies and such) then we'll shoot for `@quasar/app` v4 release.\r\n\r\nStable release will be anywhere within Q1 2021, but as is the case with OSS, it will be ready, when it's ready. And of course, it will be ready when we know the quality is high enough to meet both your expectations and ours.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the wonderful framework you've come to love is still here and you don't have to wait for Quasar v2 to start a new project with Vue 3's major new feature (i.e. using the composition API). Of course, if you choose to hold off on Vue 3 features, we'll make the upgrade as easy as possible for you. That's a promise. :slight_smile:\r\n\r\nThe Quasar
