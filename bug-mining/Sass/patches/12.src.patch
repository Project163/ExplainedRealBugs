 ## Draft 4
 
+* Allow `@forward "module" as prefix-*` to add a prefix to forwarded module.
+
 * Rename `math.unitless()` to `math.is-unitless()`, to match
   `list.is-bracketed()` and make it clear that it doesn't remove units from a
   number.

+#### Extra Prefixing
+
+If you forward a child module through an all-in-one module, you may want to add
+some manual namespacing to that module. You can do what with the `as` clause,
+which adds a prefix to every member name that's forwarded:
+
+```scss
+// material/_index.scss
+@forward "theme" as theme-*;
+```
+
+This way users can use the all-in-one module with well-scoped names for theme
+variables:
+
+```scss
+@use "material" with ($theme-primary: blue);
+```
+
+or they can use the child module with simpler names:
+
+```scss
+@use "material/theme" with ($primary: blue);
