 ### Versioning
 
-This protocol is versioned according to [semver 2.0.0]. Compatibility is
-considered from the perspective of the host. For example, if a new
-`InboundMessage` type is added, that's considered a "backwards compatible"
-change because older hosts can simply opt not to use it, even though from the
-perspective of the compiler a new message type would be a breaking change.
+This protocol is versioned according to [semver 2.0.0]. The current version is
+indicated by the `VERSION` file at the root of the repository. If this file has
+a `-dev` prerelease string, that indicates that the currently checked in version
+is in development, is not considered a release version, and must not be used by
+released versions of compilers or hosts. All release versions will also have
+GitHub tags for their version numbers.

+A "breaking change" is defined as per [the protocol buffer rules for updating a
+message type]. Compatibility is considered from the perspective of the host. For
+example, if a new `InboundMessage` type is added, that's considered a "backwards
