 ### Design Decisions
 
-Most of the design decisions involved in the proposal are based on the
-[CSS Color Level 4][color-4] specification, which we have tried to emulate as
-closely as possible, while maintaining support for legacy projects. In some
-cases, that required major changes to the way Sass handles colors:
-
-1. RGB-style channel values are no longer clamped to the gamut of a color space,
-   except for the `hsl` and `hwb` spaces, which are unable to represent
-   out-of-gamut colors. By default Sass will output CSS with out-of-gamut
-   colors, because browsers can provide better gamut mapping based on the user
-   device capabilities. However, authors can use the provided `color.to-gamut()`
-   function to enforce mapping a color into a specific gamut.
+#### Unclamped Channels
+
+Most of the design decisions involved in the proposal are based on the [CSS
+Color Level 4][color-4] specification, which we have tried to emulate as closely
+as possible while maintaining support for legacy projects. In some cases, that
+required major changes to the way Sass handles colors:
+
+1. Channel values are no longer internally clamped to the gamut of a color
+   space. By default Sass will output CSS with out-of-gamut colors, because
+   these colors are handled differently when doing interpolation across
+   different color spaces. Browsers may also eventually handle gamut-mapping for
+   these colors, although at the time of writing they do not. Authors can also
+   use the provided `color.to-gamut()` function to force a color to be mapped
+   into the gamut of its native color space.
+
 2. RGB-style channel values are no longer rounded to the nearest integer, since
    the spec now requires maintaining precision wherever possible. This is
    especially important in RGB spaces, where color distribution is inconsistent.
 
+#### Clamped Channels
+
+Per the CSS specs, certain channels are clamped at parse time [but *not* in
+interpolation] for specific color functions:
+
+[but *not* in interpolation]: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9484
+
+* All channels of the `rgb()` and `rgba()` functions.
+* The lightness channel of the `lab()`, `lch()`, `oklab()`, and `oklch()`
+  functions.
+* The lower bound of the chroma channel of the `lch()` and `oklch()` functions.
+
+However, it's necessary to use out-of-gamut values in these spaces to represent
+valid colors from other spaces—for example, `color(xyz 1 1 1)` is equivalent to
+`lab(100.12% 9.0645 5.8018)` and `color(prophoto-rgb 0 1 0)` is equivalent to
+`rgb(-221.6192400378, 279.4082218845, -109.1140773956)`. To match the behavior
+of CSS, we have to clamp these channels when constructing colors directly
+through color functions, so writing `lab(110% 0 0)` will return `lab(100% 0 0)`.
+On the other hand, to preserve colors on a round trip between spaces, we need to
+allow the internal representation of these colors to go out-of-gamut.
+
+The question remains as to how to handle cases that don't directly correspond to
+CSS, such as the `color.change()` function. Because out-of-gamut clamped
+channels are meaningful in CSS, we've chosen the design principle of preserving
+them in all situations where clamping isn't specifically mandated by CSS. In
+addition, to ensure that that the colors represent the same values in CSS that
+they do in Sass, they'll be serialized to special formats that preserves their
+out-of-gamut values:
+
+* Out-of-gamut RGB colors are serialized to `hsl()`, the lightness channel and
+  saturation upper bound of which per spec are not clamped at parse-time
+  (although in practice browsers do clamp them at time of writing). This ensures
+  that older browsers will still handle these colors somewhat correctly while
+  preserving the unclamped value for modern browsers (once they work per spec).
+
+* Out-of-gamut Lab, LCH, OKLab, and OKLCH colors are serialized to `color-mix(in
+  ..., color(xyz ...) 100%, black)` to preserve both the original color space
+  and the unclamped value in conformant browsers.
+
+#### Changing Color Spaces

 Different color spaces often represent different color-gamuts, which can present
 a new set of problems for authors. Some color manipulations are best handled
 in a wide-gamut space like `oklch`, but (for now) authors will likely prefer
