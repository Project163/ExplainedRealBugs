+The `grayscale()`, `invert()`, `alpha()`, and `opacity()` functions in
+`sass:color` will only accept color arguments, unlike their global counterparts.

 Built-in modules will contain only the functions described above. They won't
 contain any other [members](#member), CSS, or extensions. New members may be
 added in the future, but CSS will not be added to existing modules.
