+* **Context-independent modules**. It's tempting to try to make the loaded form
+  of a module, including the CSS it generates and the resolved values of all its
+  variables, totally independent of the entrypoint that cause it to be loaded.
+  This would make it possible to share loaded modules across multiple
+  compilations and potentially even serialize them to the filesystem for
+  incremental compilation.
+
+  However, it's not feasible in practice. In practice, modules that generate CSS
+  almost always do so based on some configuration, which may be changed by
+  different entrypoints rendering caching useless. What's more, multiple modules
+  may depend on the same shared module, and one may modify its configuration
+  before the other uses it. Forbidding this case in general would effectively
+  amount to forbidding modules from generating CSS.
+
+  Fortunately, implementations have a lot of leeway to cache information that
+  the can statically determine to be context-independent, including source trees
+  and potentially even constant-folded variable values and CSS trees. Full
+  context independence isn't likely to provide much value in addition to that.

 ### Resolving Extensions
 
 The module system also scopes the resolution of the `@extend` rule. This helps
