+### Error Handling
+
+When one endpoint detects that the other is violating this protocol, it must
+send a `ProtocolError` message to the other endpoint. If the error was detected
+when processing a request, the `ProtocolError` must have its `id` field set to
+the request's id. Otherwise, the `id` field must be set to `-1`.
+
+A `ProtocolError` must be sent whenever any requirements set out by this
+protocol (including the documentation in `embedded_sass.proto`) are violated.
+This includes, but is not limited to:
+
+* Sending data that can't be parsed as an `InboundMessage` (for the compiler) or
+  an `OutboundMessage` (for the host).
+
+* Sending a request with an ID that's in use by another in-flight request.
+
+* Sending a response with an ID that doesn't correspond to an in-flight
+  request's ID.
+
+* Sending a message with a `null` value for a mandatory field.
+
+The `ProtocolError` message must *not* be used to report Sass errors or errors
+running custom functions or importers.
