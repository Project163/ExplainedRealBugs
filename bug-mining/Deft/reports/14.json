When placed in a loop, this can result in the creation and collection of large numbers of temporary objects. You can create the StringBuffer before entering the loop, and append to it within the loop, thus reducing the overhead.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rschildmeijer/deft/issues/39/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rschildmeijer/deft/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
