I did something like that in my forked project.\nI see two orientation for this: \n- One infinite loop using a selector to listen for incoming request (accept) and pushing accepted sockets to one or more infinite thread loop. This is what I did in my fork :). The infinite thread loop use another selector to handle read, write and all other operations, so channel events are still executed in the same single thread.\n- One selector holding listening sockets is shared between multiple infinite IOLoop threads. Each IOLoop hold its own selector for read and write operations. There should be a lock on the shared selector but this may be easier to develop.\n\nMy purpose is to allow Deft to execute on all available CPU cores without breaking the infinite loop philosophy.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rschildmeijer","id":403336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzMzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/403336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschildmeijer","html_url":"https://github.com/rschildmeijer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschildmeijer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschildmeijer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschildmeijer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschildmeijer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschildmeijer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschildmeijer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschildmeijer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschildmeijer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rschildmeijer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rschildmeijer/deft/issues/139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rschildmeijer/deft/issues/139/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
