If a server receives such a request, it must return a \"400 Bad Request\" response, like\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: text/html\nContent-Length: 111\n\n<html><body>\n<h2>No Host: header received</h2>\nHTTP 1.1 requests must include the Host: header.\n</body></html>\n```\n\nThis requirement applies only to clients using HTTP 1.1, not any future version of HTTP. If the request uses an HTTP version later than 1.1, the server can accept an absolute URL instead of a Host: header (see next section). If the request uses HTTP 1.0, the server may accept the request without any host identification. \n\nSee: http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rschildmeijer/deft/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rschildmeijer/deft/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
