+The code above creates a "dynamic mapping" to the group capturing request handler (CapturingRequestHandler). This type 
+of mapping is convenient when creating e.g. RESTful web services where you usually address your resources with the path 
+segment instead of using get parameters. The mapping above will "capture" all requests made against urls that start with 
+"/persons/" and ends with a (positive) number, e.g. "/persons/1911" or "/persons/42". Capturing groups can only be used as the
+last url path segment like the example above. It's (currently) not possible to have more than one capturing within one 
+"dynamic mapping".
