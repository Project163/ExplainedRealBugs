Which is too big to fit into a Py_ssize_t on 32 bit, which is limited to 2^31. \n\nThe value is actually a PyInt_FromLong, from _tkinter.c:\n\n```\nstatic PyObject *\nTkapp_InterpAddr(PyObject *self, PyObject *args)\n{\n\n    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, \":interpaddr\"))\n        return NULL;\n\n    return PyInt_FromLong((long)Tkapp_Interp(self));\n}\n```\n\nWhich is interpreted as a an int->Py_ssize_t in _imagingtk.c \n\n```\nstatic PyObject*\n_tkinit(PyObject* self, PyObject* args)\n{\n    Tcl_Interp* interp;\n\n    Py_ssize_t arg;\n    int is_interp;\n    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, \"ni\", &arg, &is_interp))\n        return NULL;\n\n    if (is_interp)\n        interp = (Tcl_Interp*) arg;\n    else {\n        TkappObject* app;\n    /* Do it the hard way.

It can be passed as a PyInt, and then it needs to be interpreted as something like:\n\n```\n    void *arg;\n    PyObject *int_obj;\n    if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, \"Oi\", &int_obj, &is_interp)){\n        return NULL;\n    }\n\n    if (PyInt_Check(int_obj)) {\n        if (sizeof(arg) == 4) {\n            arg =  PyInt_AsUnsignedLongMask(int_obj); \n        } elseif (sizeof(arg) == 8) {\n            arg =  PyInt_AsUnsignedLongLongMask(int_obj);\n        } else {\n            // barf loudly?\n            return NULL;\n        }\n     } else {\n         // set error here\n        return NULL;\n
