bounding box to encompass the `a` in the first image (`fa`). \r\n\r\n### What actually happened?\r\n\r\n1. It was shifted to the right. \r\n\r\n2. Also, while flailing around, I realized that the green bounding box, which is created by an _additional_ `offsetx` shift, does appear to encompass the `a`. I don't understand why this would be, but it might just be coincidence.\r\n\r\n3. Neither of these completely bound the `a` on the top edge.
