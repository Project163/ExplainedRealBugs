It just completely lacks any documentation on how to\nuse it.  I had to debug outside my own code and deep into the PIL library\nto figure out how to use it, but it is there.  I'm just suggesting the docs\nbe changed to actually show how to handle ICC profiles, so others don't\nhave to waste hours duplicating my efforts.\n\nIf I myself could edit the docs, I might put it under the JPEG section of:\n\nhttps://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/latest/handbook/image-file-formats.html\n\nI'd mention that open() also sets the info property \"icc_profile\" if one is\npresent in the opened file, though Pillow doesn't parse it.\n\nI'd also mention that if you want to save the icc_profile, you have to\nexplicitly pass it to the save() call as:\n\n   im.save(filename, 'jpeg', icc_profile=im.info.get('icc_profile'))\n\nThat's all I'd really write on the topic.  Anything else and I'd be talking\noff the end of what I tested.\n\nThanks so much!  :)\n ~W\n\nOn Wed, Sep 10, 2014 at 10:11 AM, wiredfool notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Where did you see that?
