tiff spec defines `SAMPLEFORMAT` as N shorts, where N is the number of bands in the image. \n\nFor the old code, the sample format was set by `getscalar(SAMPLEFORMAT, (1,))`, where getformat was defined as:\n\n```\n    def getscalar(self, tag, default=None):\n        try:\n            value = self[tag]\n            if len(value) != 1:\n                if tag == SAMPLEFORMAT:\n                    # work around broken (?) matrox library\n                    # (from Ted Wright, via Bob Klimek)\n                    raise KeyError  # use default\n                raise ValueError(\"not a scalar\")\n            return value[0]\n        except KeyError:\n            if default is None:\n                raise\n            return default\n```\n\nWhich I think simply means that `SAMPLEFORMAT` isn't a scalar, and would always return the default `(1,)` value unless we happened to have a single band image, in which case, we would actually deal with it correctly. Helpfully enough, we don't actually support anything but unsigned ints in multiband images, so practically we wound up doing the right thing for the wrong reasons. \n\nThe current code just uses the `SAMPLEFORMAT` tag directly, which is fine for single band images but since we don't have any multi-item tuples defined, it's wrong for any color tiff that sets the `SAMPLEFORMAT` tag. \n\n--edit--\nIt looks like we've hit this before, since there are OSX grab lines that have the correct SAMPLEFORMAT tuple.
