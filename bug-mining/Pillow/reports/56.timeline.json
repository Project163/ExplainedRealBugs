Path):\n+                filename = str(fp.resolve())\n+        elif hasattr(fp, \"name\") and isPath(fp.name):\n+            filename = fp.name\n```\n\nFilename is the original fp, '', or fp.name. The new version adds the possibility of fp.resolve(). \n\nThe next part:\n\n```\n\n-        if isPath(fp):\n-            fp = builtins.open(fp, \"wb\")\n+        if filename:\n+            fp = builtins.open(filename, \"wb\")\n             close = 1\n```\n\nLooks suspect to me, because now we're opening the filename, and not the file pointer. I think that the file pointer should always point to something, but it might not be named. \n\ne.g.:\n\n```\n(vpy27)erics-air:Pillow erics$ python \nPython 2.7.10 (default, Jul 13 2015, 12:18:59) \n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> from tempfile import TemporaryFile\n>>> f = TemporaryFile()\n>>> f\n<open file '<fdopen>', mode 'w+b' at 0x109feb9c0>\n>>> hasattr(f, 'name')\nTrue\n>>> f.name\n'<fdopen>'\n>>> \n```\n\nSo, in this case, we have a valid fp, but the name is not openable. And for the TemporaryFile, we'd never be able to reopen it from anything other than the file pointer, because it's been deleted. (and isPath is essentially a check for a string type, so this would pass muster)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/145156463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wiredfool","id":19792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool","html_url":"https://github.com/wiredfool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/145160651","html_url":"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/1460#issuecomment-145160651","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/1460","id":145160651,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTE2MDY1MQ==","user":{"login":"wiredfool","id":19792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool","html_url":"https://github.com/wiredfool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-02T21:35:57Z","updated_at":"2015-10-02T21:35:57Z","body":"Basically, I'm thinking that when the fp has a name attribute, the filename should only be passed into the save for metadata purposes and that name should never be used to reopen the file pointer. \n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/145160651/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wiredfool","id":19792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool","html_url":"https://github.com/wiredfool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
