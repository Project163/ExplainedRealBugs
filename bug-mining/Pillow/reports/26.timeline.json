Its not a signed tiff - your ImageMagick dump, my tiffdump, tiffinfo, and ImageJ are all in complete agreement about that.  Its only a signed tiff when read by Image.open(), which is the whole problem and basis for this bug report.  The mode is reported correctly as unsigned, but the pixel values are **negative**!\n\nAs far as conversion goes, I would expect the same numerical values as I convert from unsigned 16-bit to unsigned 32-bit, and back to unsigned 16-bit (I;16B -> I -> I;16).  This should be true regardless of the numerical range because the first conversion is an up-cast, and the second conversion is a down-cast to the original numeric type.  The output above clearly shows that this is not the case.\n\nSo PR #416 and #417 are not part of the 2.2.2 release which looked to me happened after their merge into master?  From my looking at them (which I did before submitting this report, but maybe not in sufficient detail), they deal with 12-bit tiffs stored as 16-bit, where you wouldn't encounter numerical values high enough to run into signedness bugs.  If these were not merged into the 2.2.2 release, and as they are your PRs and you already have the test file in hand, can you quickly check what pixel values get reported for this file using your codebase?\n\nLastly, tiffdump does not report a SampleFormat tag for this file, so a SampleFormat tag value of 1 (unsigned) is only implied by its absence.  Or, did you read the SampleFormat tag from the file?  I always considered tiffdump the last word on what tags are present in a tiff file, but at this point I'm ready to consider any possibility.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/30952802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"igg","id":1679619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Nzk2MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1679619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg","html_url":"https://github.com/igg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/30955745","html_url":"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/452#issuecomment-30955745","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/452","id":30955745,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTU1NzQ1","user":{"login":"igg","id":1679619,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Nzk2MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1679619?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg","html_url":"https://github.com/igg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-19T19:02:32Z","updated_at":"2013-12-19T19:02:32Z","body":"For
