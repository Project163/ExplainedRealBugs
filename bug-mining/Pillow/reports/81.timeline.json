They could not actually return the memory to the system on `free` call and reuse the same memory on next `malloc`. For example, if reduce `SIZE` in the sample above to 10 Megabytes, the access to the new memory will cost the same as access to the used memory on Ubuntu. But this optimization only works in few cases:\r\n* Only with some amount of memory. For my system this optimization only works when allocated block is less than 32 Megabytes\r\n* Only with default Ubuntu allocator. This doesn't work with jemalloc or tcmalloc. This also doesn't work on Mac OS.\r\n* When no [manual options for allocator](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Memory-Allocation-Tunables.html) are set. For example if I `MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_=-1`, allocator drops optimization.\r\n\r\nPillow allocates and frees memory a lot. Almost every operation requires to recreate the bitmap. In general this is not good. If I'd write Pillow from the scratch, I'd try to do as much as possible operations (like conversion, composition, filtering) in-place. But this is huge task which requires redesign all internal and external APIs.\r\n\r\nSo how to avoid slowdown on reallocations? Once someone told me: one of the following is true: you're allocating huge amount of memory sporadically and relatively rare and you shouldn't worry about the time spend to allocations. Or you constantly need huge amount of memory. Then just don't release it. And so here I am.\r\n\r\nAs you probably know, there are two image allocators in Pillow: `ImagingAllocateBlock` and `ImagingAllocateArray`. The first works for images < 16 Megabytes of data and allocates one large chank of memory `im->linesize * im->ysize` bytes. The second works for large images and allocates small pieces of memory for each line. In both cases the allocated memory size is linked with image size. This is not good for reusing memory. Additionally, this is very sharp transaction between storage types which can lead to unpredictable performance penalties. So I've reimplemented `ImagingAllocateArray` so it allocates chain of relatively large blocks. Every block could be used and reused to store any size of images.\r\n\r\nAs I said, this is just a prototype, which should only show opportunities of this approach. To show how it works, I'll test Pillow-SIMD with `uploadcare:simd/4.3-demo` branch.

The only exception probably is the scaling to 5478x3505.\r\n\r\n**master, -s2560x1639**\r\nNo significant changes, 0-10% slower due to different storage model. The only exception is Composition, which most fast in this configuration.\r\n\r\n**this, -s2560x1638, MEMORY_BLOCK_SIZE=1MB, MEMORY_MAX_BLOCKS=0**\r\nLibc doesn't cache this pattern for some reasons. System time is bigger than ever, because almost all memory is come from system.\r\n\r\n**this, -s2560x1638, MEMORY_BLOCK_SIZE=4MB, MEMORY_MAX_BLOCKS=0**\r\nIt's magic, libc caches memory again. System time is even less than for master because scaling to 5478x3505 is also partially cached (which is notable from this operation time). Some operations are still slower than in master. If we want to keep libc cache, this requires further investigation.\r\n\r\n**this, -s2560x1638, MEMORY_BLOCK_SIZE=1MB, MEMORY_MAX_BLOCKS=256**\r\nAll memory is cached by application. System time is near zero, almost all operation have same speed as master or even faster. Scaling to 5478x3505 is faster up to 90%! Rotate->flip is the only which noticeable slower.\r\n\r\nOk, than was images which originally fit in libc cache.

The most important thing: performance of almost all operations for large images  is almost equal to performance for medium images.\r\n\r\nSo I believe this is a huge win. There are lot of thinks left to do though. There are some of them:\r\n\r\n- [x] Support for images wider than block size\r\n- [x] Reduce memory consumption for small images\r\n- [x] Lines alignment\r\n- [x] Fix errors and tests\r\n- [x] Count the statistic of allocations\r\n- [x] Core api for all options (block size, max blocks, lines alignment) and statistic\r\n- [x] Tests, of course\r\n- [x] Configure through environment variables\r\n- [x] Free cached blocks on module deinitialization\r\n- [x] Method for purging caches\r\n- [x] Clear cache to desired size\r\n- [x] Fallback with smallest chunk size\r\n- [x] Investigate libc cache behavior to use it by
