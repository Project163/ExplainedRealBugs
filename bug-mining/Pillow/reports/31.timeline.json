I don't think that it's the palette, since they're both full color RGB, non-palettized images. It looks like the implementation in PcxDecode is pretty close to the reference version, so I'm not too worried about that. \n\nIt looks like there's an off by one error in the G and B  bands. I'm guessing that it's because there's an odd number of bytes, so the even stride length is throwing something off. Comparing to an imagemagick converted pcx->png, the first 12 bytes of each band look like:\n\n```\nR band\n.pcx b'\\xb1\\xa8\\x9c\\x8d}uZh\\xb6\\xa4NX'\n.png b'\\xb1\\xa8\\x9c\\x8d}uZh\\xb6\\xa4NX'\nG band\n.pcx b'\\x00\\xa4\\x9c\\x95\\x87vnVd\\xb0\\x9eK'\n.png b'\\xa4\\x9c\\x95\\x87vnVd\\xb0\\x9eKS'\nB band\n.pcx b'H\\x00\\x9a\\x95\\x93\\x84qkTc\\xb0\\x9e'\n.png b'\\x9a\\x95\\x93\\x84qkTc\\xb0\\x9eJO'\n```\n\nThat \\x00 byte really looks like the last padding byte of the previous band's row.  I think that likely we need to make the image width match the stride, at least while decoding the band interleaved rows.\n\n(for reference, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCX , and http://web.archive.org/web/20100206055706/http://www.qzx.com/pc-gpe/pcx.txt )\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/35059596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wiredfool","id":19792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool","html_url":"https://github.com/wiredfool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/35064697","html_url":"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/523#issuecomment-35064697","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/523","id":35064697,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDY0Njk3","user":{"login":"roarc0","id":130094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDA5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/130094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roarc0","html_url":"https://github.com/roarc0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roarc0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roarc0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roarc0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roarc0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roarc0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roarc0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roarc0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roarc0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roarc0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-14T08:24:40Z","updated_at":"2014-02-14T08:26:37Z","body":"Thanks wiredfool!

The raw decoder is taking that byte stream and not discarding the padding byte.  The only problem with that theory is that the B values are only one byte off, and not two. \n\nIf I'm right, any .pcx with an odd pixel width is going to do this.

The conflict is between PcxDecode.c:62, which deals in a buffer size of stride*bands, and Unpack.c:403, which deals in pixel width. It's assigning `out[G] = in[i+pixels] which is an off by one, since that's going to be in the padding.   (This still doesn't explain why the blue is still only off by one. It should be off by two). \n\nI think what should happen is something like this just before PcxDecode.c:62:\n\n```\nif (state->bytes % state->xsize && state->butes >  state->xsize) {\n   int bands = state->bytes / state->xsize;\n   int stride = state->bytes / bands;\n   for (int i=1; i< bands; i++) {  // note -- skipping first band\n      memmove(&state->buffer[i*state->xsize], &state->buffer[i*stride], state->xsize);\n   }\n}\n```\n\nTry https://github.com/wiredfool/Pillow/commit/5ecec7db105ba48b20b1d6b8496d7caf49759243 and see if it does it for you. \n\nIf that works, then we just need to find a redistributable test image that works (though I'd bet we could write one easily enough) and include that in the test suite.  Imagemagick isn't doing even-only strides, helpfully enough.

#5203\r\n\r\nThe [PCX specification](https://web.archive.org/web/20100206055706/http://www.qzx.com/pc-gpe/pcx.txt) states that 'BytesPerLine' 'MUST be an EVEN number.'\r\nThe two images that are failing in the issue list the BytesPerLine as 371 and 409. So they are malformed.\r\n\r\nThis may not be uncommon, since it has been [noted in an earlier issue](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/523#issuecomment-35229372)\r\n> Unfortunately, both Gimp and ImageMagick both write images with odd strides\r\n\r\nThe images started to fail after #5174 (ping @wiredfool) abandoned the image's reported stride in favour of calculating it ourselves. This PR relaxes that slightly, by allowing the reported stride to tell us whether this is a well-formed image with an even stride, or a malformed image with an odd stride.\r\n\r\nIf the thinking is that we should just reject the malformed images, then this can be closed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/5214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/5214/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
