believe this is a dupe of #312 , but I wanted to make a new issue just so my current experience with it it could be tracked. Sorry if that is spammy of me.\n\nI'm on OSX 10.9, and after cloning and building the latest version of Pillow from github last night, I am having issues with properly displaying any frame of an animated GIF beyond the first frame. My test image is an animated GIF that displays correctly in my web browser and in Finder's preview, but if I load the GIF into a PIL.Image and call show() on any frame besides the first one, I get a corrupted image.\n\nI tried a couple workarounds I've seen around involving copying the palette over to subsequent frames, but they don't seem to be working for me. See below for repro code.\n\nin the following test code, I am using \nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14459075/test.gif\nas my test.gif\n\nimport PIL\nimport PIL.Image\ni = PIL.Image.open('test.gif')\ni.show() # correct image displays\ni.seek(i.tell() + 1)\ni.show() # image is incorrect\n\n![screen shot 2014-04-17 at 9 45 57 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1273943/2739561/6594654a-c6b4-11e3-8a58-cdfb59a67b4b.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/634/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10455182633,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAE7pkM4BCiQpzwAAAAJvLW0p","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/events/10455182633","actor":{"login":"radarhere","id":3112309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTIzMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3112309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/radarhere","html_url":"https://github.com/radarhere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radarhere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radarhere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radarhere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radarhere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radarhere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radarhere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radarhere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radarhere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radarhere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"392a62560312837f90b5b310ab965170a9a283a0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/radarhere/Pillow/commits/392a62560312837f90b5b310ab965170a9a283a0","created_at":"2023-09-24T12:50:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
