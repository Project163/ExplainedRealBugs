The issue seems to be that  `mingw-w64-i686-openjpeg2` is compiled with `__stdcall`, but Pillow is calling it with `__cdecl`.\r\n\r\nEdit2: I found the solution by looking at the patch in the MSYS2 repo: Pillow is setting the `OPJ_STATIC` flag, but this is incorrect on MSYS/MinGW. I added a fix in #4642
