and file_info['rgb_mask'] == (0xff0000, 0xff00, 0xff):\n                    pass\n                else:\n                    raise IOError(\"Unsupported BMP bitfields layout\")\n            else:\n                raise IOError(\"Unsupported BMP bitfields layout\")\n```\n\nThat will return an image, but the resulting image is truncated. It can be shown or saved only if `LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES` is true, but the image is one pixel shifted left and missing the top line.\n\nThis is because, for example, `self.tile` is:\n`[('raw', (0, 0, 3360, 1050), 56L, ('BGRX', 13440, -1))]` \ninstead of:\n`[('raw', (0, 0, 3360, 1050), 52L, ('BGRX', 13440, -1))]`\n\nThat third value in both cases is `offset or self.fp.tell()`, the problem with 2.8.0 is that an [extra read](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/master/PIL/BmpImagePlugin.py#L112) had been made to load in a `file_info['a_mask']`, which doesn't make sense for this format, and putting the file pointer at the wrong place.\n\nWe should only be reading that alpha value when needed.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/115237352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hugovk","id":1324225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQyMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1324225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk","html_url":"https://github.com/hugovk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/154422506","html_url":"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/1293#issuecomment-154422506","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/1293","id":154422506,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDQyMjUwNg==","user":{"login":"techtonik","id":515889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNTg4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/515889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtonik","html_url":"https://github.com/techtonik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtonik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtonik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtonik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtonik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtonik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtonik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtonik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtonik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techtonik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-06T14:29:10Z","updated_at":"2015-11-06T14:30:07Z","body":"The
