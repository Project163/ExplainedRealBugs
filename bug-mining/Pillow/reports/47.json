Example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nim = Image.open('foo.jpg')\r\nim.save('bar.jpg', icc_profile=im.info.get('icc_profile'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould I suggest the documentation be updated to explain this?  Thanks!\r\n\r\nI haven't fiddled with any of the other image formats, so I don't know if they are similar or not.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n ~Wyvern\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"wiredfool","id":19792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool","html_url":"https://github.com/wiredfool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/890/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/890/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
