Decoders that recognize the sRGB chunk but are not capable of colour management [ICC] are recommended to ignore the gAMA and cHRM chunks, and use the values given above as if they had appeared in gAMA and cHRM chunks.\r\n\r\n> It is recommended that the sRGB and iCCP chunks do not both appear in a PNG datastream\r\n\r\nSo, it appears in the spec that the proper set is (iCCP | sRGB) + gAMA + cHRM.
