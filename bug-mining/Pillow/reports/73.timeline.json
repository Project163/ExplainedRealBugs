Now, you can't, but you can still crop an image to end up with an image of zero size. Is there a reason it is allowed based on some operations but not in a new image? It seems it should either be allow in both instances or neither.\r\n\r\n@rakeshvar's commit comment:\r\n\r\n> I strongly agree with @manthey. This check should not even be there.

It acts as an additive identity, and is key to defining a [Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)) (here, in the image space). This helps if you are stitching images together - which has obvious uses. Also like @manthey mentioned, when you crop (subtract) an image from itself, it results in the zero image. Hence denying a zero is not mathematically consistent, and will result in bugs. \r\nLack of zero becomes a serious problem if you are using functional programming tools like fold/reduce to add a bunch of images. The presence of zero lets one use those tools out of the box (thanks to duck-typing in
