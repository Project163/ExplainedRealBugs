I'm a bit confused with all the testing frameworks floating around (but in a good way). I see this from .travis.yaml:\n\n```\n    # Don't cover PyPy: it fails intermittently and is x5.8 slower (#640)\n  - if [ \"$TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION\" == \"pypy\" ]; then time python selftest.py; fi\n  - if [ \"$TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION\" == \"pypy\" ]; then time nosetests Tests/test_*.py; fi\n\n```\n\nwhich tells me we're running selftest.py and nosetests on all the tests in the Tests/ directory. (Do we still need selftest.py?)\n\nAdd in the recent confusion over running tests \"in place\" vs. \"installed\" and I think we have an opportunity to clean up/streamline our testing framework(s).\n","closed_by":{"login":"aclark4life","id":72164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life","html_url":"https://github.com/aclark4life","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/729/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
