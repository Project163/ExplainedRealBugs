ICO is listed as read-only, but this is what it says under ICO:\n\n> ### ICO\n> \n> ICO is used to store icons on Windows. The largest available icon is read.\n> \n> The `save()` method supports the following options:\n> - `sizes`: A list of sizes including in this ico file; these are a 2-tuple, (width, height); Default to [(16, 16), (24, 24), (32, 32), (48, 48), (64, 64), (128, 128), (255, 255)]. Any size is bigger then the original size or 255 will be ignored.\n\nHow can a read-only file format have a `save()` method? Is this just in the wrong section, or have I misunderstood something?\n","closed_by":{"login":"wiredfool","id":19792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool","html_url":"https://github.com/wiredfool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/2179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/2179/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
