an example of aoi\nimg = Image.open('bmg1.bmp')\nimg2 = img.crop(aoi)\nimg2.show()\n```\n\neverything is fine , but if I run:\n\n``` python\nfrom PIL import Image\naoi = (1, 1, 10, 10)\nimg = Image.open('bmg1.bmp')\nimg = img.crop(aoi)\nimg.show()\n```\n\nsame error happens if i do:\n\n``` python\nfrom PIL import Image\naoi = (10, 10, 15, 15)\nimg = Image.open('bmg1.bmp').crop(aoi)\nimg.show()\n```\n\nthe python.exe will crash, i am not sure if this is CPython's bug or pillow's bug. \n\ni doubt the crop function seems to return a Image object that is different from the original one, thus run show() on it gives errors, while does not on the original one.\nboth python 27 and python 34 have this problem, hope that will be resolved soon.\n\nthanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"wiredfool","id":19792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool","html_url":"https://github.com/wiredfool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/1077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/1077/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
