I've noticed that saving GIF's uses a massive amount of memory.  \n\nThe example below opens a 6.5M GIF, rotates it and saves it to a new file, 4.5M GIF.  Somehow the function Image.save uses ~1G to get it done!\n\nDoing the same thing with a jpeg uses less than 1M.\n## Demonstration\n\nThe entire script is shown in the profiler output.\n### Profiler results\n#### GIF\n\n``` bash\n$ python -m memory_profiler pillow_issue_gif.py\nFilename: pillow_issue_gif.py\n\nLine #    Mem usage    Increment   Line Contents\n================================================\n     3   18.934 MiB    0.000 MiB   @profile\n     4                             def f():\n     5   20.012 MiB    1.078 MiB       im = Image.open('MountWilson.gif')\n     6                                 #im.rotate(45).show()\n     7  129.625 MiB  109.613 MiB       im2 = im.rotate(45)\n     8 1153.125 MiB 1023.500 MiB       im2.save('Test-new.gif', \"GIF\")\n```\n#### JPEG\n\n``` bash\n$ python -m memory_profiler pillow_issue_jpeg.py\nFilename: pillow_issue_jpeg.py\n\nLine #    Mem usage    Increment   Line Contents\n================================================\n     3   18.980 MiB    0.000 MiB   @profile\n     4                             def f():\n     5   20.055 MiB    1.074 MiB       im = Image.open('MountWilson.jpeg')\n     6                                 #im.rotate(45).show()\n     7  308.359 MiB  288.305 MiB       im2 = im.rotate(45)\n     8  308.555 MiB    0.195 MiB       im2.save('Test-new.jpeg', \"JPEG\")\n```\n\nI'm kinda surprised the rotate operation uses so much memory too.\n### Input files\n\n``` bash\n$ llg MountWilson\n-rw-r--r--@  1 minmac  staff   6.5M 28 Aug 09:40 MountWilson.gif\n-rw-r--r--@  1 minmac  staff   2.2M 28 Aug 09:43 MountWilson.jpeg\n```\n### Output files\n\n``` bash\n$ llg Test\n-rw-r--r--   1 minmac  staff   1.7M 28 Aug 16:21 Test-new.jpeg\n-rw-r--r--   1 minmac  staff   4.9M 28 Aug 16:24 Test-new.gif\n```\n## Environment Information\n\nOSX 10.11.6\npython 2.7.12\npillow 3.1.1\n\nI haven't profiled it on linux but i know its happening because I'm reaching preset 1GB memory limit on AWS lambda which is running:\n- Linux kernel version – 4.1.27-25.49.amzn1.x86_64\n- python 2.7\n- pillow 3.3.0\n","closed_by":{"login":"wiredfool","id":19792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5Nzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool","html_url":"https://github.com/wiredfool","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wiredfool/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/2093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/2093/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
