This happens because `HashTable` and `Heap` are typedef-ed twice (once in the header file, once in the source file). Depending on your compiler and C standard you're using, this may cause the compilation to fail.\nThere is a thread on a similar issue [here](http://code.google.com/p/pycparser/issues/detail?id=70), with links for those curious about more details.\n\nIt's an easy fix, as `git diff` can show:\n\n```\ndiff --git a/libImaging/QuantHash.c b/libImaging/QuantHash.c\nindex 58d8813..b2bdb06 100644\n--- a/libImaging/QuantHash.c\n+++ b/libImaging/QuantHash.c\n@@ -29,7 +29,7 @@ typedef struct _HashNode {\n    HashVal_t value;\n } HashNode;\n\n-typedef struct _HashTable {\n+struct _HashTable {\n    HashNode **table;\n    uint32_t length;\n    uint32_t count;\n@@ -38,7 +38,7 @@ typedef struct _HashTable {\n    KeyDestroyFunc keyDestroyFunc;\n    ValDestroyFunc valDestroyFunc;\n    void *userData;\n-} HashTable;\n+};\n\n #define MIN_LENGTH 11\n #define RESIZE_FACTOR 3\ndiff --git a/libImaging/QuantHeap.c b/libImaging/QuantHeap.c\nindex bddcf14..20379ac 100644\n--- a/libImaging/QuantHeap.c\n+++ b/libImaging/QuantHeap.c\n@@ -23,12 +23,12 @@\n\n #include \"QuantHeap.h\"\n\n-typedef struct _Heap {\n+struct _Heap {\n    void **heap;\n    int heapsize;\n    int heapcount;\n    HeapCmpFunc cf;\n-} Heap;\n+};\n\n #define INITIAL_SIZE 256\n```\n\nThis should compile for any compiler.\n\nI'd also be happy to turn this into a pull request if preferred.\n","closed_by":{"login":"evertrol","id":735460,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTQ2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/735460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertrol","html_url":"https://github.com/evertrol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertrol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertrol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertrol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertrol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertrol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertrol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertrol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertrol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evertrol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
