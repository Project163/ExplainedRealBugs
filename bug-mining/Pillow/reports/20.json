This currently seems to be unsupported. \n\nFor a sample image, the debug mode spits out the following:\n\n`format key: ('II', 1, 1, 1, (12,), ())`\n\nNow I thought I'd cheat and just insert a key into the OPEN_key dict in TiffImagePlugin.py\n\n`(II, 1, 1, 1, (12,), ()): (\"I;16\", \"I;16\")`\n\nThis now obviously messes up the image, and my tiff file ends seemingly prematurely. \n\nAm I missing something? If it is possible to read 12bit tiffs easily, please let me know. If it is as of yet unsupported, I am happy to help, although I am afraid I will need some pointers :)\n\nHere are two samples: [Single frame](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m7fnq76ih3my8mo/sample-single.tif), [small stack](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oh82f8jsrpiq0ei/sample.tif) (500mb!).\n","closed_by":{"login":"kadrach","id":206176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjE3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/206176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrach","html_url":"https://github.com/kadrach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadrach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
