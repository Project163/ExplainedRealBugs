It shouldn't happen, because we're keeping a reference to the core image structure in the new `_ImageCrop` object.\n\nThe problem appears to go away if we make a copy of the core image object in `_ImageCrop.__init__` rather than a pointer to it. Copying the image removes the entire point of having a lazy crop in the first place. \n\n(not that it makes a huge amount of sense anyway -- it's the one lazy operation other than load, and it requires the initial image to be loaded anyway.
