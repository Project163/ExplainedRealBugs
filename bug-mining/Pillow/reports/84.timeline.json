release notes:\r\n* [x] https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/3406: Done in https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/pull/3451\r\n\r\n## Main release checklist\r\n\r\n* [x] Open a release ticket\r\n* [x] Develop and prepare release in ``master`` branch.\r\n* [x] Check [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/python-pillow/Pillow) and [AppVeyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/python-pillow/Pillow) to confirm passing tests in ``master`` branch.\r\n* [x] Check that all of the wheel builds [Pillow Wheel Builder](https://github.com/python-pillow/pillow-wheels) pass the tests in Travis CI.\r\n* [x] In compliance with [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/), update version identifier in `src/PIL/_version.py`\r\n* [x] Update `CHANGES.rst`.\r\n* [x] Run pre-release check via `make release-test` in a freshly cloned repo.\r\n* [x] Create branch and tag for release e.g.:\r\n```\r\n    $ git branch 5.4.x\r\n    $ git tag 5.4.0\r\n    $ git push --all\r\n    $ git push --tags\r\n```\r\n* [x] Create source distributions e.g.:\r\n```\r\n    $ make sdist\r\n```\r\n* [x] Create [binary distributions](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/blob/master/RELEASING.md#binary-distributions)\r\n* [x] Upload all binaries and source distributions e.g. ``twine upload dist/Pillow-5.4.0-*``\r\n* [x] Create a [new release on GitHub](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/releases/new)\r\n* [x] In compliance with [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/), append `.dev0` to version identifier in `src/PIL/_version.py`\r\n\r\n## Binary Distributions\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n* [x] Contact `@cgohlke` for Windows binaries via release ticket e.g. https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/1174.\r\n* [x] Download and extract tarball from `@cgohlke` and ``twine upload *``.\r\n\r\n### Mac and Linux\r\n* [x] Use the [Pillow Wheel Builder](https://github.com/python-pillow/pillow-wheels):\r\n```\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/python-pillow/pillow-wheels\r\n    $ cd pillow-wheels\r\n    $ git submodule init\r\n    $ git submodule update Pillow\r\n    $ cd Pillow\r\n    $ git fetch --all\r\n    $ git checkout [[release tag]]\r\n    $ cd ..\r\n    $ git commit -m \"Pillow -> 5.2.0\" Pillow\r\n    $ git push\r\n```\r\n* [x] Download distributions from the [Pillow Wheel Builder container](http://a365fff413fe338398b6-1c8a9b3114517dc5fe17b7c3f8c63a43.r19.cf2.rackcdn.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Publicize Release\r\n\r\n* [x]
