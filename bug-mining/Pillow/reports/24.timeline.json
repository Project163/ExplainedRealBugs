FWIW:  `SystemError: error return without exception set` is an error from the C extension level where something is returning an error condition but not setting an exception. It's not going to be something that is going to be traceable in the python side of things. \n\nIn this case, it's because of a function returning a Py_ssize_t (a signed 64 bit integer) by calling return xsize \\* ysize, which were both signed 32bit ints.  If that was > 2gpix, then it overflowed into negative values. That was then cast to a Py_ssize_t as a simple widening, preserving the sign. Casting before returning prevents the overflow. \n\nTry that patch and see what it does for you.
