There's some tests (eg slow DOS memory tests) which aren't part of the standard test suite.\n\n`selftest.py` could be brought under nose. Its purpose is to be run first to check the build sanity. So it should definitely come first, and that should be possible. But perhaps it's better to explicitly be a separate test? Do some people use `selftest.py` to verify an install, and might not want to run the full test set?\n\nI'm not sure how we'd get `python setup.py test` to run the tests. (At least nose isn't an absolute requirement -- we should be able to run them something along the lines of `python -m unittest discover -p 'test_*.py'` but I think nose gives more flexibility.)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/47133880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hugovk","id":1324225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQyMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1324225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk","html_url":"https://github.com/hugovk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/47439046","html_url":"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/729#issuecomment-47439046","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/729","id":47439046,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDM5MDQ2","user":{"login":"aclark4life","id":72164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life","html_url":"https://github.com/aclark4life","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-28T21:29:58Z","updated_at":"2014-06-28T21:29:58Z","body":"@hugovk What about `test-installed.py?` Is there some trick to running that?

I assume the right thing to do is give up on configuring a test suite in `setup.py`.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/87800928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aclark4life","id":72164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life","html_url":"https://github.com/aclark4life","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":268834234,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQyNjg4MzQyMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/events/268834234","actor":{"login":"aclark4life","id":72164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life","html_url":"https://github.com/aclark4life","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-30T19:32:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":270145832,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjcwMTQ1ODMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/events/270145832","actor":{"login":"aclark4life","id":72164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life","html_url":"https://github.com/aclark4life","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aclark4life/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"0d64171481c29ec5355ccc29032ff1477815bf98","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/commits/0d64171481c29ec5355ccc29032ff1477815bf98","created_at":"2015-04-01T00:22:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
