'u' change is not that serious: it may be enough for small scripts to be \"almost\" compatible with Python 3.x, but for larger modules it usually doesn't matter. \n\nLook: there are also 'foo' strings that have to be fixed because they are bytestrings in 2.x and unicode in 3.x. So you have to explicitly mark all 'foo' strings as b'foo' if they should be bytestrings, and u'foo' if they should be unicode (and str('foo') if they should be bytestrings under 2.x and unicode under 3.x). \n\nBut if all strings are explicitly marked with either b or u or str(), you can safely add `from __future__ import unicode_literals` to the top of the file and remove the \"u\" clutter. At this point it doesn't matter if supported Python is 3.3 or 3.2 because the code is compatible with both (and is cleaner IMHO).\n\nPython 2.7 has some improvements in standard library (e.g unittest2 or memoryview support or collections.OrderedDict or argparse) and it also has some syntax changes borrowed from 3.x (like {1,2,3} syntax for sets) - this makes writing new code easier. \n\nBut if library already supports Python < 2.7, then it doesn't use any of these new features (this is exactly the Pillow case) so Python 2.7 provides almost nothing in terms of easier Python 3.x porting (because pre-2.7 syntax like set([1,2,3]) still works in 3.x). There are some edge cases fixed in standard library in 2.7 that may help with porting (e.g. base64 accepting bytearray as well as bytes - that works in 2.7 and in 3.x, but not in 2.6) - but these are edge cases.\n\nThere may be C API changes that I'm not aware of (I use Cython for C extensions and it provides compatibility automatically), but chances are the situation with C API in 2.7 is similar.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/14632575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kmike","id":107893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike","html_url":"https://github.com/kmike","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/comments/14632802","html_url":"https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/79#issuecomment-14632802","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-pillow/Pillow/issues/79","id":14632802,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NjMyODAy","user":{"login":"kmike","id":107893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzg5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike","html_url":"https://github.com/kmike","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kmike/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-03-08T17:39:01Z","updated_at":"2013-03-08T17:39:01Z","body":"Thanks
