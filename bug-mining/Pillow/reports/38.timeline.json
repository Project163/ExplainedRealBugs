further information. PA images (which are 2 channel, P + A, each 8 bits) are hard to create:\n- You can't create one by adding an alpha channel to a P image. \n- Fast Octree quantization on an RGBA image returns a P image where the palette is RGBA items, not a PA image. I was getting errors trying to save that, so I'm not sure that that way is roses either. It appears that some parts of the palette code assume a max of 3 bands. \n- Internally, you can't setmode from P to PA, since that is an inplace operation. \n- There's no convert mapping from P to PA.\n- Finally, I think that the only format that actually saves PA images is the internal ImageMath format, which is essentially raw data. Tiff is the only other one that reads them. \n- You can make a PA image from Image.new. \n\nSo, PA probably isn't the answer. \n\nIf you haven an RGBA palette, that's stored in bands (which is what the python layer uses -- the C layer seems to use interleaved palettes), then the fitst 768 bytes will be the RGB palette, and the last 256 would be the tRNS header. I'll take a look and see if that's a plausible way to handle it. And hey, it should work: PngImagePlugin.py:586. As long as info['transparency'] and encoderinfo['transparency'] are none, that should work. It's tested here: Tests/test_file_png.py:164.
