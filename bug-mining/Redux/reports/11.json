I'd rather change it to be the other way: put app server at `3000` and use something like `3001` for WebpackDevServer. This way you don't have to memorize which example you are running.\n- You need to `npm start & npm run client` in universal example. I struggled with non-working example for 15 minutes before figuring that out. This is obvious to someone experienced with server rendering, but wasn't obvious to me. I missed that part in the doc, and I'm sure a lot of people will `npm start` and expect things to happen.\n- I'd prefer to see `client`, `server` and `universal` folder structure at the very top, which signals which modules are related to which part. Lots of universal examples follow that structure and we should do it too.\n","closed_by":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/643/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
