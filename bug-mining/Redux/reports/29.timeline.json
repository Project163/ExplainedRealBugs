importing `hibp` in a project built with webpack will use the UMD build when targeting the web (the default behavior when webpack's `target` field is unspecified). This is suboptimal for various reasons and it should probably be removed for now (following [redux's lead](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/2345) here).\r\n\r\nIt appears the [unpkg CDN](https://unpkg.com) checks the `unpkg` field first when resolving the entry point if unspecified, so we should replace `browser` with that. Otherwise, users will have to include the `dist/hibp.min.js` file path in their `<script>` tags.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wKovacs64/hibp/issues/8/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wKovacs64/hibp/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1423206580,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0MjMyMDY1ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/events/1423206580","actor":{"login":"seantcoyote","id":1198032,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTgwMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1198032?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seantcoyote","html_url":"https://github.com/seantcoyote","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seantcoyote/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seantcoyote/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seantcoyote/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seantcoyote/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seantcoyote/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seantcoyote/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seantcoyote/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seantcoyote/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seantcoyote/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bc5120f64c8a56b2b3c94695e483d25ad8251789","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seantcoyote/redux/commits/bc5120f64c8a56b2b3c94695e483d25ad8251789","created_at":"2018-01-14T05:30:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
