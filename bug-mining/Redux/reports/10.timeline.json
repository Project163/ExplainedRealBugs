Suggesting we use a generalized function to sanitize input, rather than looking at the input directly, is dangerously hand wave-y. \n\nI can certainly add some text to the docs warning of the potential pitfalls of accepting user input. In particular, emphasizing the importance of the `parseInt` call and other sanitization methods on input. \n\nAnother good idea would be to not just pass in initial state, but instead dispatch some actions to an empty store to populate it. Then you could make sure your reducers are hardened, which applies to both the server and the client.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/comments/135461238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/comments/135468786","html_url":"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/635#issuecomment-135468786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/635","id":135468786,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTQ2ODc4Ng==","user":{"login":"ericf","id":29096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericf","html_url":"https://github.com/ericf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-27T15:26:21Z","updated_at":"2015-08-27T15:28:17Z","body":"Defense in depths.
