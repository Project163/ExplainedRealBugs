I am building with webpack. I have tried following the suggestions for setting `NODE_ENV` to `\"development\"`, but the ie9 errors persist.\n\nSome things I have tried with no success:\n\nIn my conditional build configuration:\n\n``` javascript\n// Webpack build config is conditionally loaded for prod or development:\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {\n  module.exports = require('./webpack.config.website.prod.js')\n} else {\n\n  // adding this line does not help the ie9 errors:\n  process.env.NODE_ENV = 'development'\n\n  module.exports = require('./webpack.config.website.dev.js')\n}\n```\n\nAdding it to `DefinePlugin` in `webpack.config.website.dev.js` as mentioned in the [referenced SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/30061249/1432801) also does not help ie9:\n\n``` javascript\n// ... config ...\nnew webpack.DefinePlugin({\n      'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n}),\n```\n\n## Minimal config\n\nHere is a minimal webpack config which still causes the error to be shown in ie9:\n\n``` javascript\nvar webpack = require('webpack');\nvar path = require('path');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n\n  entry: {\n    main: './js/website/main.js',\n    'category-je-minforme': './js/website/category-informe.js',\n  },\n\n  output: {\n    filename: '[name].js',\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'webroot/wp-content/themes/apr_main/js'),\n    pathinfo: true,\n  },\n\n  plugins: [\n    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({\n      Promise: 'imports?this=>global!exports?global.Promise!es6-promise',\n      fetch: 'imports?this=>global!exports?global.fetch!whatwg-fetch',\n    }),\n    new webpack.DefinePlugin({\n      'process.env.NODE_ENV': '\"development\"',\n      DEVELOPMENT: true,\n      DEBUG: true,\n    }),\n  ],\n\n\n  module: {\n    loaders: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.js$/,\n        include: [\n          path.resolve(__dirname, 'js'),\n          path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/qs'),\n        ],\n        loader: 'babel-loader',\n        query: { cacheDirectory: './.babelCache' },\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  debug: true,\n  devtool: 'source-map',\n}\n```\n\n## `.babelrc`\n\nIn case it's relevant, here's my `.babelrc`.

allow React 15.4.0 RC\n\n### [`v4.4.5`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.4.5)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.4.4...v4.4.5)\n\n-   Fixes a regression introduced in 4.4.4 where cleaning up the state in parent’s `componentWillUnmount` caused an error in child’s `mapStateToProps` ([#&#8203;351](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/351), [`ea53d6f`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/commit/ea53d6fb076359a864a1d543568d951d4b3eab3d))\n\n###

when `mapStateToProps()` doesn’t care about `ownProps` ([#&#8203;348](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/348), [#&#8203;300](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/300))\n-   (Even if it does, you might be able to benefit from this optimization—read [https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/pull/348](https://togithub.com/reactjs/react-redux/pull/348) for details)\n\n### [`v4.4.3`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.4.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.4.2...v4.4.3)\n\n-   State shape warning now has a more descriptive message ([#&#8203;335](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/335), [#&#8203;309](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/309))\n-   State shape check is now a warning rather than a hard error, and is disabled in production for better performance ([`90f427b`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/commit/90f427bc3da274162d69dc336e3b8e94c3087b24))\n\n### [`v4.4.2`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.4.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.4.1...v4.4.2)\n\n-   Custom `mergeProps` now works correctly with components that have `pure: false` ([#&#8203;337](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/337), [#&#8203;338](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/338))\n\n### [`v4.4.1`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.4.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.4.0...v4.4.1)\n\n-   React v15 is now allowed as a peer dependency ([#&#8203;317](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/317), [#&#8203;319](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/319))\n\n### [`v4.4.0`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.4.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.3.0...v4.4.0)\n\n-   Removes the broken `jsnext:main`. It is supposed to point to the ES module build but we mistakingly pointed it to the `src`, so it never worked for anyone anyway. For now, we don’t provide an ES module build in React Redux, so if you use Rollup, you need to use the CommonJS plugin for it. Realistically, it doesn’t make a big difference because React Redux assumes you use React anyway (which uses CommonJS), and it also doesn’t benefit from tree shaking because there are only two exports (`connect` and `<Provider>`) and you will need both pretty much any time.\n\nThis is a minor bump because we couldn’t break anybody with this (it was broken before), but it seems to deserve more than a patch bump as it’s a change in the build configuration.\n\n### [`v4.3.0`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.3.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.2.1...v4.3.0)\n\n-   Adds per-instance memoization API. If your `mapStateToProps` or `mapDispatchToProps` returns a function, *that* function will be used instead for the given component instance. Most apps never need this, but it can be handy for custom memoization logic in apps with large component trees. It can bring significant performance improvements when used together with Reselect. ([#&#8203;279](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/279), [`7ee928b`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/commit/7ee928b23ea0ad15e22b51d7d4aff5eb1a0f95b5), [#&#8203;179](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/179))\n\n### [`v4.2.1`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.2.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.2.0...v4.2.1)\n\n-   Bump Lodash to 4.2.0 ([rackt/redux#&#8203;1346](https://togithub.com/rackt/redux/issues/1346), [rackt/redux#&#8203;1349](https://togithub.com/rackt/redux/issues/1349))\n\n### [`v4.2.0`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.2.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.1.2...v4.2.0)\n\n-   `isPlainObject` that we use internally is now outsourced to Lodash 4.1 ([rackt/redux#&#8203;1339](https://togithub.com/rackt/redux/issues/1339)). Note that this does not mean we depend on Lodash itself. We only use a tiny module from it. We also use the same module in Redux >= 3.2.0.\n\n### [`v4.1.2`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.1.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.1.1...v4.1.2)\n\n-   Don't depend on `console` or `console.error` ([https://github.com/rackt/redux/issues/1311](https://togithub.com/rackt/redux/issues/1311), https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/commit/208efae97b59c39930533c6b3825a23f6f3d4b33)\n-   Remove warning from the production builds (https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/commit/208efae97b59c39930533c6b3825a23f6f3d4b33)\n\n### [`v4.1.1`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.1.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.1.0...v4.1.1)\n\n-   Adds `loose-envify` as a dependency to fix builds for Browserify users. ([#&#8203;1304](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1304) & [#&#8203;1306](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1306))\n\n### [`v4.1.0`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.1.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.0.6...v4.1.0)\n\n-   For Browserify users, Redux should now be properly envified without extra configuration ([#&#8203;274](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/274))\n\n### [`v4.0.6`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.0.6)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.0.5...v4.0.6)\n\n-   Fixes a regression on IE8. ([https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/issues/232](https://togithub.com/rackt/react-redux/issues/232), [https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/issues/233](https://togithub.com/rackt/react-redux/issues/233), https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/commit/caae2e1d53775b89716683f7d6a5d8302cad5a87, https://phabricator.babeljs.io/T2817)\n\n### [`v4.0.5`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.0.5)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.0.4...v4.0.5)\n\n-   Avoids unnecessary recalculation of props for components that don't specify `mapStateToProps` (https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/commit/6c504b966839be0e739d5a566c8fb844c27a6c44#commitcomment-15145082, https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/commit/04693ca0cabe021b27b62eb9240b51459ffe8c32)\n\n### [`v4.0.4`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.0.4)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.0.3...v4.0.4)\n\n-   Avoids use of `Object.defineProperty()` to prevent errors in IE8 ([https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/issues/227](https://togithub.com/rackt/react-redux/issues/227))\n\n### [`v4.0.3`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.0.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.0.2...v4.0.3)\n\n-   Fixes a bug that caused the props of connected components to not updated during a hot update with something like React Hot Loader. Internally, it involved moving the memoized calculations from `shouldComponentUpdate()` into more appropriate places such as `componentWillReceiveProps()`, `handleChange()`, and `render()`. ([https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/issues/224](https://togithub.com/rackt/react-redux/issues/224), [https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/pull/225](https://togithub.com/rackt/react-redux/pull/225))\n\n### [`v4.0.2`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.0.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.0.1...v4.0.2)\n\n-   Fixes a bug that caused `mapStateToProps` to be called twice instead of just once before the component is mounted. ([https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/pull/196](https://togithub.com/rackt/react-redux/pull/196))\n\n### [`v4.0.1`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v4.0.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v4.0.0...v4.0.1)\n\n-   Removes `.babelrc` in the compiled package because it is irrelevant (we ship ES5 code) and breaks React Native 0.16 and some consumers who use Babel 6 forgetting to exclude `node_modules` from transformations. ([https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/pull/213](https://togithub.com/rackt/react-redux/pull/213), [https://github.com/rackt/redux/issues/1033](https://togithub.com/rackt/redux/issues/1033), [https://github.com/rackt/redux/issues/1039](https://togithub.com/rackt/redux/issues/1039), [https://github.com/rackt/redux/issues/1127](https://togithub.com/rackt/redux/issues/1127))\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
