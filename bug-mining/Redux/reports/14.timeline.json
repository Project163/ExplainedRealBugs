you for your contribution!\r\nTo help speed up the process of merging your code, check the following:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] I added new tests for the issue I fixed/built (n/a)\r\n- [ ] I ran `npm test` for the package I'm modifying (n/a)\r\n- [x] I used `npm run commit` instead of `git commit`\r\n\r\nIt's not needed anyway. It's also causing issues when used with React-Native packager, which processes node_modules with Babel\r\n\r\n(https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1033#issuecomment-156584084)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cyclejs/cyclejs/issues/495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cyclejs/cyclejs/issues/495/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":900313259,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDkwMDMxMzI1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/events/900313259","actor":{"login":"staltz","id":90512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/staltz","html_url":"https://github.com/staltz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staltz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staltz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staltz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staltz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staltz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staltz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staltz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staltz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staltz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b8da8c429bbb6e47fd4a7a0b2c9585d9866d39ed","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cyclejs/cyclejs/commits/b8da8c429bbb6e47fd4a7a0b2c9585d9866d39ed","created_at":"2016-12-20T15:54:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
