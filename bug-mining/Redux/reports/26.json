Code here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/docs/recipes/ServerRendering.md\r\n```\r\nfunction handleRender(req, res) {\r\n  // Create a new Redux store instance\r\n  const store = createStore(counterApp)\r\n\r\n  // Render the component to a string\r\n  const html = renderToString(\r\n    <Provider store={store}>\r\n      <App />\r\n    </Provider>\r\n  )\r\n\r\n  // Grab the initial state from our Redux store\r\n  const preloadedState = store.getState()\r\n\r\n  // Send the rendered page back to the client\r\n  res.send(renderFullPage(html, preloadedState))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code lives inside the server.js file, alongside the express app. After looking at other parts of the docs, it seems that JSX components are put under the /components directory. Is it implied that this file needs to be compiled also? I don't see anything on that page mentioning that, but otherwise it's not going to work. It seems strange even for the components to have a .js file ending, when they include jsx in them.
