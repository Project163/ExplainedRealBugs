Per https://reactcommunity.org/ , the ReactJS org policy is: \n\n> 3) Avoid Burnout\n> \n> The first priority in managing the issue tracker for a reactjs project is avoiding burnout. Sprawling lists of inactionable, open issues, is burnout’s most potent fuel.\n> \n> This means:\n> - Bug reports without test cases (copy/paste-able code is enough) can be closed with or without comment.\n> - Usage questions can be closed immediately and directed to stack overflow. Owners should pay attention though, because the docs or the APIs probably need help if there are a lot of “question issues”.\n> - Feature requests without thoughtful commentary and sample code can be closed with or without comment.\n> - Issues without activity in the last 30 days can be closed with or without comment. If this is a bug you care about that isn’t getting attention, fix it. If you’re good enough to understand the bug, you’re good enough to fix it. Remember, it’s our code now.\n\nBased on that, I'd say we ought to create an issue template for Redux that expresses these ideas, to try to cut down on non-bug issues, and redirect people to SO or Reactiflux for questions.  \n\nDo any other ReactJS projects have an issue template already?  If not, should we make a common one for use in multiple repos?\n","closed_by":{"login":"markerikson","id":1128784,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjg3ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1128784?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson","html_url":"https://github.com/markerikson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/1775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/1775/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
