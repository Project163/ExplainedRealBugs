\r\n`const x: Type = value` and `const x = values as Type` have **very different meaning** - the first will cause a warning if `value` is not assignable to `Type` and the second will accept many `value`s that are \"kind of similar, but not really\" and just mark them as `Type` nonetheless.\r\n\r\nYou should only ever use `as` in very few situations - and even then probably rather write `const x = value satisfies Type as Type` (assuming you have access to the `satisfies` keyword which was added in TypeScript 4.9. At that point, I would debate the readability of the latter, which would come down to\r\n```ts\r\nexport const useAppDispatch = useDispatch satisfies () => AppDispatch as () => AppDispatch\r\nexport const useAppSelector = useSelector satisfies TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> as TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have red squiglies with the original code (which is perfectly fine TypeScript), please share the error message with us. You might have some misconfiguration going on on your side.\r\n\r\nEdit: to showcase the error with `as` a bit more, look at this example:\r\n```ts\r\ninterface SomeInterface {\r\n    foo: number\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst test1: SomeInterface = {\r\n    foo: 5\r\n}\r\nconst test2 = {\r\n    foo: 5\r\n} as SomeInterface\r\n\r\n// here you get an error\r\nconst test3: SomeInterface = {}\r\n\r\n// here you do not get an error\r\nconst test4 = {} as SomeInterface\r\n\r\n// TypeScript will not stop you from accessing this and assume that the result is a `number`, while it is `NaN`!\r\nconst something = test4.foo / 5\r\n```\r\nA TypeScript assertion (that's what `as` is called) essentially means \"I know better than the type checker\" and disables big parts of the type system and results in much less type security.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/comments/1377923351/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"phryneas","id":4282439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI0Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas","html_url":"https://github.com/phryneas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8196124967,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAi17dM5bCZ7UzwAAAAHohvEn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/events/8196124967","actor":{"login":"sameera","id":208470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODQ3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/208470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera","html_url":"https://github.com/sameera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-10T21:42:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8196124974,"node_id":"SE_lADOAi17dM5bCZ7UzwAAAAHohvEu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/events/8196124974","actor":{"login":"sameera","id":208470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODQ3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/208470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera","html_url":"https://github.com/sameera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-10T21:42:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/comments/1378055614","html_url":"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/4463#issuecomment-1378055614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/4463","id":1378055614,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAi17dM5SI3W-","user":{"login":"sameera","id":208470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODQ3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/208470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera","html_url":"https://github.com/sameera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-11T00:02:25Z","updated_at":"2023-01-11T00:02:25Z","body":"@phryneas
