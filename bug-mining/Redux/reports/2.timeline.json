just wrote a tiny router for redux called [redux-tiny-router](https://github.com/Agamennon/redux-tiny-router) it is basically 3 parts, all quite small, one middleware one reducer and some action creators, i was inspired by the cerebral reactive router, to treat the router as just state, there is no wrapper functions no components, just add in the middleware the reducer, and make use of the actions provided to tell the router what to do.\n\nI would like some feedback  as to if this is a good approach! i like the result a lot for the moment. \n\nAlso it has some nice functionality on the server side for universal apps, it tracks your promises to know if the app is ready to render, and even re-render server side if there is side effects on the first render (component will mount) \n\nPlease know, the documentation is just a first draft and the server side part is implemented but not documented.\n\nAgain any feedback is

by this little [tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/710642981016100864).\n## Problem: Side Effects and Composition\n\nWe discussed effects in Redux for ages here but this is the first time I think I see a sensible solution. Alas, it depends on a language [feature that I personally won’t even hope to see in ES](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/one-shot-delimited-continuations-with-effect-handlers). But would that be a treat.\n\nHere’s the deal. [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) and [Redux Saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga) are relatively easy to use and have different pros and cons but [neither of them composes well](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/822#issuecomment-145271384). What I mean by that is they both need to be “at the top” in order to work.\n\nThis is the big problem with middleware. **When you [compose independent apps into a single app](https://productpains.com/post/redux/there-is-no-easy-way-to-compose-redux-applications), neither of them is “at the top”. This is where the today’s Redux paradigm breaks down—we don’t have a good way of composing side effects of independent “subapplications”.**\n\nHowever, this problem has been solved before! If we had a fractal solution like [Elm Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial) for side effects, this would not be an issue. [Redux Loop](https://github.com/raisemarketplace/redux-loop) implements Elm Architecture and composes well but my opinion its API is a bit too awkward to do in JavaScript to become first-class in Redux. Mostly because it forces you to [jump through the hoops](https://github.com/raisemarketplace/redux-loop/blob/c39c533bdbfdb2581dd19806c4cd69944818d7c1/modules/combineReducers.js#L25-L26) to compose reducers instead of just calling functions. If a solution doesn’t work with vanilla `combineReducers()`, it won’t get into Redux core.\n## Solution: Algebraic Effects in JavaScript\n\nI think that what @sebmarkbage suggested in [this Algebraic Effects proposal](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/one-shot-delimited-continuations-with-effect-handlers) is exactly what would solve this problem for us.\n\n**If reducers could “throw” effects to the handlers up the stack (in this case, Redux store) and then continue from they left off, we would be able to implement Elm Architecture a la Redux Loop without the awkwardness.**\n\nWe’d be able to use vanilla `combineReducers()`, or really, any kind of today’s reducer composition, without worrying about “losing” effects in the middle because a parent didn’t explicitly pass them up. We also would not need to turn every reducer into a generator or something like that. We can keep the simplicity of just calling functions but get the benefits of declaratively yielding the effects for the store (or other reducers! i.e. `batch()`) to interpret.\n\nI don’t see any solution that is as elegant and simple as this.\n\nIt’s 2am where I live so I’m not going to put up any code samples today but you can read through the [proposal](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/one-shot-delimited-continuations-with-effect-handlers), combine it with [Redux Loop](https://github.com/raisemarketplace/redux-loop), and get something that I think is truly great.\n\nOf course I don’t hold my breath for that proposal to actually get into ES but.. let’s say we could _really_ use this feature and Redux is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries this year so maybe it’s not such a crazy feature as one might think at first :smile: .\n\n---\n\ncc people who contributed to relevant past discussions: @lukewestby @acdlite @yelouafi

understand that this is the principle underlying all of redux, and that it comes with all these awesome benefits that are pretty well known by now.\n\nHowever, I feel that one place that redux is lacking in, is that it doesn't openly describe the conceptual disadvantages of using this architecture. Perhaps this is a good choice since you want people to not shy away due to the negatives.\n\nI'm just curious because it applies not just to redux, but in some capacity to other things like [Om](https://github.com/omcljs/om), [datomic](http://www.datomic.com/) and that [talk about turning the database inside out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9hR3kiOK0). I like redux, I like Om, I'm interested in datomic, and I really liked that talk.\n\nBut for all the searching I've done, it's hard to find people critical of the single immutable store. [This](http://staltz.com/why-react-redux-is-an-inferior-paradigm.html) is an example, but it just seems to have a problem more with the verbosity of redux than with the actual architecture.\n\nThe only things I can think of is that perhaps it takes more memory to keep storing copies of your state, or that it's a little harder to rapidly protoype with redux.\n\nBecause you guys have probably put a lot more thought into this than I have, could you help elucidate this for

## Resolution: use Redux Toolkit\r\n> The ideas in this thread eventually turned into our official **[Redux Toolkit package](https://redux-toolkit.js.org)**.  It includes utilities to simplify many common Redux use cases, including store setup, reducer definition, immutable update logic, creating entire \"slices\" of state automatically without writing any action creators or action types by hand, and even automatic data fetching and caching with the \"RTK Query\" API.\r\n>\r\n> For more details on what problems Redux Toolkit is meant to solve, **[see the \"Vision for Redux Toolkit\" manifesto I wrote](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-starter-kit/issues/82#issuecomment-456261368)** .\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number one complaint I see about Redux is that there's \"too much boilerplate\".  I also frequently see complaints that there's too much to learn, too many other addons that are needed to do anything useful, and too many aspects where Redux doesn't have any opinion and therefore doesn't offer any kind of built-in guidance.\r\n\r\nI just had a discussion with @tannerlinsley regarding several of these aspects.  We discussed the [Jumpstate](https://github.com/jumpsuit/jumpstate) library, which is an abstraction layer around Redux, and how it was intended to ease the learning curve, as well as various philosophical opinions about what constitutes \"good\" Redux usage.\r\n\r\nOut of that, we came up with several questions that I would like to bring up for wider discussion:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Key points\r\n\r\n#### Boilerplate / Verbosity\r\n\r\n- Redux is not intended to be the \"most concise way of doing things\", but rather to make data flow obvious and readable\r\n- Docs are written in a deliberately verbose style for clarity and learning, and not specifically intended as \"the one true way to write Redux code\", but that style has been somewhat blindly adopted (or, sometimes, resulted in rejecting Redux)\r\n- Frequent complaints about \"boilerplate\", such as \"too many files\", \"use of action creators\", etc\r\n\r\n#### Abstractions and Learning\r\n\r\n- The core Redux library itself is effectively feature-complete, but there's lots of interesting addons and tools being built by the community\r\n- Various abstraction libs have been built to \"ease learning curve\" or \"make things more OOP\", but most of these are not really \"idiomatic\" Redux usage\r\n- Redux learning curve can be steep, but once you grasp concepts, the need for abstraction layers often goes away\r\n\r\n\r\n### Problems\r\n\r\n- What are the \"boilerplate\" complaints mostly about?\r\n- What are the hardest aspects of Redux for new learners?\r\n- What are the \"no opinions\" areas that cause problems for people?\r\n\r\n### Potential Solutions\r\n\r\n- What would idiomatic Redux usage with \"less boilerplate\" look like?  How can we provide solutions to those complaints?\r\n- What possible abstractions could be created that simplify the process of learning and usage, but without actually hiding Redux (and would hopefully provide a migration/learning path to \"base\" Redux)?\r\n- How much of this could be solved with improved docs in some way?\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to invite the community to offer up complaints, pain points, and concerns about using Redux, and hopefully also provide suggestions and ideas for solving those problems as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/2295/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/2295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mfp22","id":13700926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzAwOTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13700926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfp22","html_url":"https://github.com/mfp22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfp22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfp22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfp22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfp22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfp22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfp22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfp22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfp22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mfp22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-28T20:33:16Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T20:33:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/749","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/749/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/749/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/749/events","html_url":"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/749","id":107159303,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMDcxNTkzMDM=","number":749,"title":"Best

the Reducer docs it says:\n\n```\nSometimes state fields depend on one another and more consideration is required, but in our case we can easily split updating todos into a separate function..\n```\n\nI'd like to know how to handle that specific use case. To give an example, say I have a form with multiple data fields. I have another component elsewhere that should react to changes in form, e.g change state based on whether the form data is valid, or compute values from different inputs to the form and display them.\n\nWhile I believe I can have different reducers (which handle different slices of the state tree) listen to the same action and update themselves, the \"reactive\" state would not have access to the other branches of the state tree that it needs in order to compute itself.\n\nOne solution I've thought of is to have the \"reacting\" process happen by using subscribe to listen to changes in the state tree, compute whether or not a relevant change was made, then dispatch a new action to update the dependent fields. However, this publishing blast might have to become very generic, so that all reducers that care about it will be able to use the payload it comes with.\n\nI'm new to Redux, so I'm not sure if there is an adopted pattern for this type of thing.

前言\r\n\r\n前面我们已经用了三篇文章详细介绍了 Redux 的概念、原理及 Middleware 机制。今天我们来看一个 Redux 官方出品的 middleware 库：`redux-thunk`。  \r\n可能大部分用了 Redux 的项目都会用到`redux-thunk`，但你有没有想过这个库到底是用来干嘛的？如果我不用它行不行？这篇文章我们就来详细聊一下这个库。  \r\n其实很早之前我就看过它的代码，看到它的代码量的时候被震惊了，没想到一个 GitHub 上 Star 数过万的项目，总的代码行数只有 10 行左右（我当时看的是 1.x 版本，代码量只有 8 行）。虽然我不喜欢用代码行数来衡量一个项目，但这么少的代码量当时还是觉得挺诧异的。\r\n\r\n_注意：这篇文章我会假定你对 redux 及 redux middleware 的工作机制有所了解，如果这部分还不是很熟悉，推荐你看一下[前几篇文章](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3yoHo6UXI2VOPO9zWI2aCQ)。_\r\n\r\n## 用法\r\n\r\n首先，我们还是来看一下这个库的用法。`redux-thunk`是作为`redux`的 middleware 存在的，用法和普通 middleware 的用法是一样的，注册 middleware 的代码如下：\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport thunkMiddleware from 'redux-thunk'\r\nconst store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware))\r\n```\r\n\r\n注册后可以这样使用：\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// 用于发起登录请求，并处理请求结果\r\n// 接受参数用户名，并返回一个函数(参数为dispatch)\r\nconst login = (userName) => (dispatch) => {\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'loginStart' })\r\n  request.post('/api/login', { data: userName }, () => {\r\n    dispatch({ type: 'loginSuccess', payload: userName })\r\n  })\r\n}\r\nstore.dispatch(login('Lucy'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n可以看到，`redux-thunk`主要的功能就是可以让我们`dispatch`一个函数，而不只是普通的 Object。后面我们会看到，这一点改变可以给我们巨大的灵活性。  \r\n了解了如何使用，接下来我们看一下它的实现原理。\r\n\r\n## 什么是 thunk？\r\n\r\n我记得我在很长的时间里都把`redux-thunk`的名字看成了`redux-thank`，理解成了感谢 redux。。。其实我觉得这个库最令人迷惑的地方之一就是它的名字。其实`thunk`是函数编程届的一个专有名词，主要用于*calculation delay*，也就是延迟计算。  \r\n用代码演示如下：\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction wrapper(arg) {\r\n  // 内部返回的函数就叫`thunk`\r\n  return function thunk() {\r\n    console.log('thunk running, arg: ', arg)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n// 我们通过调用wrapper来获得thunk\r\nconst thunk = wrapper('wrapper arg')\r\n\r\n// 然后在需要的地方再去执行thunk\r\nthunk()\r\n```\r\n\r\n可以看到，这种代码的模式是非常简单的，以前我们可能都写过类似这样的代码，只是不知道这种代码叫做`thunk`而已。\r\n\r\n## redux-thunk 源码\r\n\r\n由于`redux-thunk`的代码量非常少，我们直接把它的代码贴上来看一下。这里我们看的是最新版的`v2.3.0`的代码：\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction createThunkMiddleware(extraArgument) {\r\n  return ({ dispatch, getState }) => next => action => {\r\n    if (typeof action === 'function') {\r\n      return action(dispatch, getState, extraArgument);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return next(action);\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst thunk = createThunkMiddleware();\r\nthunk.withExtraArgument = createThunkMiddleware;\r\n\r\nexport default thunk;\r\n```\r\n\r\n如果你看了前几篇文章，对 Redux 及它的 middleware 机制有所了解，那么上面这段代码是非常容易理解的。`redux-thunk`就是一个标准的 Redux middleware。  \r\n它的核心代码其实只有两行，就是判断每个经过它的`action`：如果是`function`类型，就调用这个`function`（并传入 dispatch 和 getState 及 extraArgument 为参数），而不是任由让它到达 reducer，因为 reducer 是个纯函数，Redux 规定到达 reducer 的 action 必须是一个 plain object 类型。  \r\n`redux-thunk`的原理就这么多，是不是非常简单？\r\n\r\n## 起源\r\n\r\n`redux-thunk`的代码和原理非常简单，但我觉得难的部分是*为什么需要这样一个库*。关于`redux-thunk`的起源可以看一下 Redux 001 号的 issue:\r\n[How to dispatch many actions in one action creator](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/1 \"How to dispatch many actions in one action creator\")\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-10-06 at 9.19.14 PM](http://qiniu.mdnice.com/23b1f61de961d4e65985e446c2e4048a.png)\r\n\r\n大概意思就是问如何一次性发起多个 action，然后作者回答我可以让 actionCreator 返回一个函数。然后相关的 PR 如下：\r\n[fix issue 001](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/commit/c2a870a3a9a97ddc0f1c84fc40fe58b8f742a248 \"fix issue 001\")\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-10-06 at 9.43.34 PM](http://qiniu.mdnice.com/b9d6bc0c5f311b64f368ef6719865946.png)\r\n\r\n那个时候`redux-thunk`还没有独立，而是写在`redux`的 action 分发函数中的一个代码分支而已。和现在的`redux-thunk`逻辑一样，它会判断如果传入的 action 是一个`function`，就调用这个函数。现在将`redux-thunk`独立出去，用 middleware 的方式实现，会让 redux 的实现更加统一。  \r\n看到这里，其实我们对`redux-thunk`感到迷惑很大部分原因就是它涉及的`thunk`等的概念比较陌生而已，其实你大可以将它的名字理解为*redux-function*，也就是它只是让 dispatch 支持函数，仅此而已。\r\n\r\n## 为什么需要？\r\n\r\n现在我们理解了`redux-thunk`可以让我们 dispatch 一个 function，但是这有什么用呢？其实我觉得这是一项基础设施，虽然功能简单，但可扩展性极其强大。\r\n\r\n比如很多时候我们需要在一个函数中写多次 dispatch。这也是上面 issue 中提到的问题。比如上面我们示例代码中，我们定义了 login 函数做 API 请求，在请求发出前我们可能需要展示一个全局的 loading bar，在请求结束后我们又需要将请求结果存储到 redux store 中。这都需要用到 redux 的 dispatch。\r\n\r\n当然在一个函数中写多个 dispatch 只是我们可以做的事情之一，既然它是一个 function，而且并不要求像 reducer 一样是 pure function，那么我们可以在其中做任意的事情，也就是有副作用(side effect)的事情。\r\n\r\n## 总结\r\n\r\n`redux-thunk`是一个非常小的 library，但我觉得理解它的概念对于我们理解 redux 是至关重要的。它和另一个非常流行的库`redux-saga`一样，都是在 redux 中做*side effect*必不可少的。之后有时间我们会介绍一下`redux-saga`，如果感兴趣欢迎关注公众号。\r\n\r\n最后附上前两篇关于 Redux 的文章，请参考：\r\n\r\n[深入理解 Redux Middleware](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/3yoHo6UXI2VOPO9zWI2aCQ)  \r\n[Redux

PR Type\r\n\r\n**Does this PR add a _new_ page, or update an _existing_ page?**\r\n\r\nAdds the new \"Quick Start\" page\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there an existing issue for this PR?\r\n  - #3674 \r\n- [ ] Have the files been linted and formatted?\r\n\r\n## What docs page is being added or updated?\r\n\r\n- **Section**: Introduction\r\n- **Page**: Quick Start\r\n\r\n## For Adding New Content\r\n\r\n### What kind of content category is this page (tutorial, how-to, explanation, reference)?\r\n\r\nThe \"Quick Start\" page is a form of tutorial, but intended to demonstrate the \"fastest\" / \"easiest\" / \"correct\" way to use Redux without explaining _why_ things work this way.  \r\n\r\n### Who is the intended target audience?\r\n\r\nBeginners who know nothing about Redux, yet.\r\n\r\n#### What knowledge are we assuming they have?\r\n\r\n- JS syntax: ES6, `async/await`, object spreads\r\n- React: components, hooks\r\n- Other: HTTP / AJAX, `fetch`\r\n\r\n### What are the intended results or takeaways from reading this page?\r\n\r\nReaders should be able to mimic the demonstrated patterns to create a basic React+Redux app that does some CRUD work.\r\n\r\n### What is the most critical info they should learn?\r\n\r\n- Redux is a tool for managing state outside of your React components\r\n- The Redux Toolkit package is the simplest and recommended way to use Redux\r\n- Key React+Redux APIs (`configureStore`, `createSlice`, `useSelector` / `useDispatch`)\r\n- Immutability is vital, but either requires hand-written updates or use of RTK+Immer \"magic\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nHacked together this initial skeleton of a page.  So far I've done:\r\n\r\n- Figured out how to use MDX with Docusaurus\r\n- Added reusable components for `<Note>` (including multiple styles based on the Cypress.io docs) and `<DetailedExplanation>`\r\n- Created an empty \"Quick Start\" page\r\n- Added some initial \"what is this and why would I use it?\" content\r\n- Added instructions on creating a project\r\n\r\nI got stuck with some yak shaving when I realized that using the `diff` highlighting format leaves the `+-` diff signs as copyable characters, and ideally I'd like them _not_ copied or selectable.  I tried playing with `user-select: none` and the `:first-letter` selector, but it's not quite doing what I want.\r\n\r\nPutting this up for ongoing feedback as we work through this.\r\n\r\n/cc
