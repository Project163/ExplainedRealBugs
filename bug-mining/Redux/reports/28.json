This causes startup to fail, unless the reducers provide default values for state. [Here's a codepen](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/yMrLzg?editors=0010) which replicates the issue.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWhen providing a `preloadedState`, I would expect to not need to provide a default value in my reducer, since I've already provided one in the form of `preloadedState`. I understand that this is to ensure that reducers are properly-written, in that they don't return `undefined` even when passed `undefined`. However, if a field in the store is populated using `preloadedState` and never changed, it seems silly to have to do either:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst propReducer = (state = null, action) => state\r\n```\r\nor\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst preloadedState = window['__PRELOADED_STATE__']\r\nconst propReducer = (state = preloadedState.prop, action) => state\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the very least, I think the documentation for using preloaded state should be updated to include this, because it wasn't entirely obvious (without reading the redux source code) why I needed to provide this default when, in my mind, I already had.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of Redux, and which browser and OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of Redux?**\r\nThe browser/OS/version aren't really relevant, since the unexpected behavior will occur in any scenario.","closed_by":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/2338/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/2338/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
