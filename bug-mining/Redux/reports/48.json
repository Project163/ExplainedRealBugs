Right now, if you read through the section [Adding the Login Page](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-4-using-data#adding-the-login-page), the code block for `App.tsx` imports `selectCurrentUsername` from `'./features/auth/authSlice'`. But if you look at the most [recent code block defining `authSlice`](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-4-using-data#adding-an-auth-slice), there is no definition for that selector included.\r\n\r\n## What should be changed to fix the problem?\r\n\r\nThere's two options:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new code block beneath the `App.tsx` code block, showing `selectCurrentUsername` being defined:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// features/auth/authSlice.ts\r\nexport const selectCurrentUsername = (state: RootState) => state.auth.username\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr,\r\n\r\n2. Update the [original `authSlice` codeblock](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-4-using-data#adding-an-auth-slice) to include this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// features/auth/authSlice.ts\r\nexport const selectCurrentUsername = (state: RootState) => state.auth.username\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/4724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/4724/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
