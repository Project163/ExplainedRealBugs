It's as simple as adding a `[Symbol.observable]()` hook that returns a basic observable (it doesn't have to be Rx-based or anything).\n### Pros\n1. Adding this hook will enable interoperability with RxJS 5, and it should do the same for Kefir, Bacon, Most, and others.\n2. People can stop asking me \"what's the difference between RxJS and redux?\"\n3. People that want to use a more reactive methodology for delivering state to components can do so without forgoing the wonderful tooling this community has put together\n4. It's a relatively minimal change\n### Cons\n\nNeed to include a small `Symbol.observable` shim. Should probably add some integration test to a common library which adds one development-time dependency.\n\nattn/ @gaearon @zenparsing\n","closed_by":{"login":"gaearon","id":810438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon","html_url":"https://github.com/gaearon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/1631/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":4,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/1631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
