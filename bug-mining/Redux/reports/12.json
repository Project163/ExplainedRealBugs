This means breaking reference equal every action, which limits its usefulness when using nested combinations unless you always select all the way down to the piece of state that maintains reference equality integrity. It'd be a little bit more slow to introduce an equality check, after the `mapValues` but it seems like it'd be better, yeah?\n","closed_by":{"login":"gaearon","id":810438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon","html_url":"https://github.com/gaearon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/853/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/853/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
