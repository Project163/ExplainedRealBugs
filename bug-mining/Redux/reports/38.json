I tried running this test out of `create-react-app` boilerplate and it errored out. If fixing this part of the docs is approachable by a beginner in a few days' time I can certainly try and fix it in my spare time.","closed_by":{"login":"markerikson","id":1128784,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjg3ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1128784?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson","html_url":"https://github.com/markerikson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markerikson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/3868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/3868/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
