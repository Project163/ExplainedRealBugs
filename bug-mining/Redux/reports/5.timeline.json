In v1.0.0  the `createConnector` code\n\n```\nthis.context.store.subscribe(::this.handleChange)\n```\n\nwas moved from the constructor to the `componentDidMount`. This causes an issue with sync dispatches because the `<Connector>` mounts after the child components and the `this.handleChange` listener is not attached yet. \n\nTo fix this, we will have to move that code back to the constructor or earlier in the component lifecycle, so it will be called before the child components call dispatch.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/comments/118892846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"taylorhakes","id":341159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTE1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/341159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes","html_url":"https://github.com/taylorhakes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":348748704,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzQ4NzQ4NzA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/events/348748704","actor":{"login":"gaearon","id":810438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon","html_url":"https://github.com/gaearon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-07-06T15:31:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":348748705,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM0ODc0ODcwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/events/348748705","actor":{"login":"gaearon","id":810438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon","html_url":"https://github.com/gaearon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-07-06T15:31:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/comments/118896309","html_url":"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/208#issuecomment-118896309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/208","id":118896309,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExODg5NjMwOQ==","user":{"login":"taylorhakes","id":341159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTE1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/341159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes","html_url":"https://github.com/taylorhakes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorhakes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-06T15:35:02Z","updated_at":"2015-07-06T15:35:02Z","body":"He
