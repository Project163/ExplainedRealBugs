I could, rather than wrapping the initial render in a promise to prefetch data, instead just use `redux-promise` to issue an initial action and hook into the `.then` returned from `dispatch` to send the response once it resolves. That would make it so the entire prefetch is redux-based.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/comments/135528020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/comments/135529653","html_url":"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/643#issuecomment-135529653","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux/issues/643","id":135529653,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTUyOTY1Mw==","user":{"login":"gaearon","id":810438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon","html_url":"https://github.com/gaearon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-27T19:25:35Z","updated_at":"2015-08-27T19:25:35Z","body":"Yes,
