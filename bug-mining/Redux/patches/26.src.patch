 The following is the outline for what our server side is going to look like. We are going to set up an [Express middleware](http://expressjs.com/guide/using-middleware.html) using [app.use](http://expressjs.com/api.html#app.use) to handle all requests that come in to our server. If you're unfamiliar with Express or middleware, just know that our handleRender function will be called every time the server receives a request.
 
+Additionally, as we are using ES6 and JSX syntax, we will need to compile with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (see this example of a [this example of a Node Server with Babel](https://github.com/babel/example-node-server)) and the [React preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/).
