+The [Redux logo](./logo/) is dedicated to the public domain and licensed under [CC0]([CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)).  
+You can copy, modify, and distribute it, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.  
+
+[Read more about CC0.](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)  
+You can find its legal text below.
+
+#### Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal
+
+CC0 1.0 Universal
+
+Statement of Purpose
+
+The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
+exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
+subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
+authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
+
+Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
+purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
+works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
+claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
+and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
+purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
+contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
+further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
+reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
+efforts of others.
+
+For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
+of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
+Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
+and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
+and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
+Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
+effect of CC0 on those rights.
+
+1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
+protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
+Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
+to, the following:
+
+  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
+  and translate a Work;
+
+  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
+
+  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
+  depicted in a Work;
+
+  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
+  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
+
+  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
+  a Work;
+
+  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
+  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
+  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
+  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
+
+  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
+  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
+
+2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
+applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
+unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
+and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
+known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
+action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
+duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
+extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
+copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
+commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
+the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
+detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
+shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
+any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
+by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
+
+3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
+judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
+shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
+Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
+is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
+non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
+unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
+the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
+provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
+in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
+purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
+promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
+of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
+License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
+applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
+invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
+affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
+Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
+and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
+Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
+
+4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
+
+  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
+  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
+
+  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
+  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
+  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
+  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
+  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
+  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
+
+  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
+  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
+  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
+  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
+  or other rights required for any use of the Work.
+
+  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
+  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
+  CC0 or use of the Work.

+# The Redux Logo
+
+This is the only official Redux logo.  
+Don’t use any other logos to represent Redux.  
+
+It comes in several flavors.
+
+## Just the Logo
+
+<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/redux/master/logo/logo.png' alt='Redux Logo' width='300'>
+
+Download as [PNG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/redux/master/logo/logo.png) or [SVG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/redux/master/logo/logo.svg).
+
+## Logo with a Dark Title
+
+<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/redux/master/logo/logo-title-dark.png' alt='Redux Logo with Dark Title' width='500'>

+Download as [PNG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/redux/master/logo/logo-title-dark.png).
+
+## Logo with a Light Title
+
+<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/redux/master/logo/logo-title-light.png' alt='Redux Logo with Light Title' width='500'>
+
+*(You can’t see the text but it’s there, in white.)*
+
+Download as [PNG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/redux/master/logo/logo-title-light.png).
+
+## Modifications
+
+Whenever possible, we ask you to use the originals provided on this page.
+
+If for some reason you must change how the title is rendered and can’t use the prerendered version we provide, we ask that you use the free [Lato Black](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) font and ensure there is enough space between the logo and the title.
+
+When in doubt, use the original logos.
+
+## Credits
+
+The Redux logo was designed by [Matthew Johnston](http://thedeskofmatthew.com/).  
+Thanks to [Jay Phelps](https://github.com/jayphelps) and [the community](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/151) for contributing earlier proposals.
