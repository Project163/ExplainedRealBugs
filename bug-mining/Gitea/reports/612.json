Feature Description\n\nCurrently the `/repos/{orga}/{repo}/pulls` endpoint supports the following sort options:\n\n- oldest\n- recentupdate\n- leastupdate\n- mostcomment\n- leastcomment\n- priority\n\nI'm trying to get a list of PRs in the order they've been merged, from most recent to oldest.\nSince the repository has a lot of PRs and I only want to collect PRs since a certain date (to generate a changelog), the API is called with pagination and the cancellaction condition for pagination is \"any merged_at <= certain date\".\n\nThe problem with my behavior currently is, that this stops at pulls that have been merged a long time ago but have been updated somehow (e.g. someone wrote a comment).\nIf I remove the `recentupdate` sort criteria, then I could miss old PRs that got merged later.\n\nFor performance reasons I can't read all PRs from the repository, even with state closed.\n\nTo support my use case, it would be great to have a sort type `recentmerged`, or something similar, which returns all PRs in the opposite order they've been merged (newest to oldest).\n\nIf I oversee a combination of options which would mimic this, I'd appreciate a hint to accomplish my use case :-)\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No
