While doing a broad search for this pattern, I noticed that you use `\"omitempty\"` as the name of a structure field.\n\nhttps://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/cd225d7034f905f73319b5a9024f6f9d5b6a01c7/models/admin/task.go#L47\n\nInstead, I believe you intended to use `\",omitempty\"` to keep the default name and add the `omitempty` option.\n\nYou can test this behavior with this simple Go program. As you can see by the result, the `omitempty` key in the JSON string gets unmarshaled to the field with the `json:\"omitempty\"` tag.\n\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"encoding/json\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n)\n\ntype SomeStruct struct {\n\tSomeField string `json:\"omitempty\"`\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\tu := SomeStruct{}\n\t_ = json.Unmarshal([]byte(`{\"omitempty\": \"123\"}`), &u)\n\tfmt.Printf(\"Result: %#v\\n\", u)\n\t// Result: main.SomeStruct{SomeField:\"123\"}\n}\n\n```\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n-\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nNo\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\n-\n\n### Database\n\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33660/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
