It's quite nice.  However, it gets cluttered up when partial tickets are still open when a dead project is archived.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Have a team (org) with a repository\r\n* One of your team members opens a PR\r\n* Comment on the PR\r\n* Archive the repository\r\n* Open the Pull Request view\r\n* Choose the \"Reviewed by you\" menu option\r\n* See the PR that can no longer be closed\r\n\r\nI don't know if this affects all of the Pull Request menu options.  While writing up this report, I noticed that it affects the Issues (\"Mentioning you\" and \"Created by you\") views, too.\r\n\r\nThese things are not actionable, and I guess they will live forever.  So, could we exclude them from the lists and the counts?\r\n\r\nI think a workaround is to close everything manually before archiving a dead project repo.  Is that what we should do?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Gitea Version\r\n\r\n1.22.4\r\n\r\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Log Gist\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nPR view showing a partial PR in a dead (archived) repo:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67d50a37-f10e-47d1-9edd-65afb2fd3754)\r\n\r\nIssue view showing multiple open issues from that same dead (archived) repo:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84427e8f-2566-4f6a-a737-3d93afac18f5)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Git Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### How are you running Gitea?\r\n\r\nself hosted container\r\n\r\n### Database\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
