It is as slow as before, due to the order in which the query is processed. You can see it by the count of the rows which will be processed.\r\n\r\nTo change the order of the internal query process, you need to give an index hint (IDX_action_c_u_d) for the action table too.\r\n```sql\r\nEXPLAIN SELECT `action`.*  FROM `action` USE INDEX FOR JOIN (`IDX_action_c_u_d`) INNER JOIN  `repository` USE INDEX FOR JOIN (`PRIMARY`) ON `repository`.id = `action`.repo_id WHERE user_id = 7  AND is_deleted = 0  ORDER BY `action`.`created_unix` DESC  LIMIT 20;\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nmysql> EXPLAIN SELECT `action`.*  FROM `action` USE INDEX FOR JOIN (`IDX_action_c_u_d`) INNER JOIN  `repository` USE INDEX FOR JOIN (`PRIMARY`) ON `repository`.id = `action`.repo_id WHERE user_id = 7  AND is_deleted = 0  ORDER BY `action`.`created_unix` DESC  LIMIT 20;\r\n+----+-------------+------------+------------+--------+---------------+------------------+---------+----------------------+------+----------+-------------+\r\n| id | select_type | table      | partitions | type   | possible_keys | key              | key_len | ref                  | rows | filtered | Extra       |\r\n+----+-------------+------------+------------+--------+---------------+------------------+---------+----------------------+------+----------+-------------+\r\n|  1 | SIMPLE      | action     | NULL       | index  | NULL          | IDX_action_c_u_d | 19      | NULL                 |   20 |     1.00 | Using where |\r\n|  1 | SIMPLE      | repository | NULL       | eq_ref | PRIMARY       | PRIMARY          | 8       | gitea.action.repo_id |    1 |   100.00 | Using index |\r\n+----+-------------+------------+------------+--------+---------------+------------------+---------+----------------------+------+----------+-------------+\r\n2 rows in set, 1 warning (0.00 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the table action is processed at first with the where and limit condition and after that it matches against the repository table. There are much less rows processed and so the query is significant faster.\r\nSo it would be nice if this query could be fixed with this index hint for the action table.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/1830278112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gunman808","id":146823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjgyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunman808","html_url":"https://github.com/gunman808","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunman808/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunman808/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunman808/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunman808/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunman808/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunman808/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunman808/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunman808/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gunman808/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/1853085171","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28155#issuecomment-1853085171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28155","id":1853085171,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx285uc9Xz","user":{"login":"42wim","id":1810977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTA5Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1810977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/42wim","html_url":"https://github.com/42wim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/42wim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/42wim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/42wim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/42wim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/42wim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/42wim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/42wim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/42wim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/42wim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-13T00:41:42Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T00:41:42Z","body":"blocked
