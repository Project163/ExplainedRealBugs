Description\n\nWhen gitea is syncing users from LDAP, changing user's e-mail address in LDAP and syncing users to gitea (cron task) creates extra e-mail address for this user in gitea db (`email_address` table) but should only change existing e-mail address like in LDAP.\r\n\r\nAs result, all old user e-mail addresses are remembered in gitea and if other user is assigned in LDAP e-mail address that was already assinged in the past in LDAP (and was freed), say `test1@example.com`, syncing such user from LDAP to gitea throws an error\r\n```\r\n2023/12/30 15:56:50 .../ldap/source_sync.go:134:Sync() [E] SyncExternalUsers[ldap]: Error creating user test: e-mail already in use [email: test1@example.com]\r\n```\r\nbecause such freed e-mail address is still in use on gitea's side by previous user.\r\n\r\nConsider updating gitea user's primary e-mail address only from LDAP mail attribute without creating separate entry in `email_address` table.\r\n\r\nRelated:
