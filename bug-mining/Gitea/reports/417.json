However, it can be done via the git client. Doing so turns the release into a draft release. Pushing the tag again does not fix the release.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a repository with some content and clone it locally\r\n2. Add a tag: `git tag test`\r\n3. Push the tag: `git push origin test`\r\n4. Create a release for the tag\r\n5. Delete the tag on the server: `git push origin --delete test`\r\n6. Observe that the release is now a \"draft\"\r\n7. Push the tag again: `git push origin test`\r\n8. Observer that the release is still a \"draft\"\r\n\r\n### Observations\r\n\r\nWhen pushing the tag a second time, the following message is logged:\r\n```\r\n2024/11/05 17:48:34 ...s/repository/push.go:40:handler() [E] pushUpdate[user/example-repo] failed: PushUpdateAddDeleteTags: Insert: pq: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"UQE_release_n\"\r\n```\r\nI can't provide more detailed logs at the moment. I can set up a test environment, though, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression. We upgraded from 1.21.x, which did not show this behaviour. Unfortunately, I did not make note which exact version we used before.\r\n\r\n### Use case\r\n\r\nI realise deleting are re-creating tags from the command line seems like an odd thing to do. We do it as part of a nightly build pipe line, which builds binaries and attaches them to a moving tag and release named `latest`.\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.22.3\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nNo\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n2.39.2\n\n### Operating System\n\nDebian GNU/Linux\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nOfficial release binary, started via systemd\n\n### Database\n\nPostgreSQL","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32427/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
