limitation, but has path length limitation.\r\nBy default it is 260, considering path length is longer than filename, so I think it is ok to do this.\r\n\r\nFor Windows, see

Description\n\nWhen creating a filename using the website you may accidentally add whitespace to the filename which can lead to unexpected events, attempting to clone a repo which contains a file that has a trailing whitespace on Windows leads to this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://demo.gitea.com/future/test-filename.git\r\nCloning into 'test-filename'...\r\nremote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.\r\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.\r\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.\r\nremote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\r\nReceiving objects: 100% (3/3),

status'\r\nand retry with 'git restore --source=HEAD :/'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis leads me to open this discussion to see if it's worth asking the gitea devs to perform whitespace removal (trim) at both the end and start of the filename string so this can be prevented automatically.\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.23.0+dev-273-ga4899ffa24\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n###
