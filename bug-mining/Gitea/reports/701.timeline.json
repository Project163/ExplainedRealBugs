There is a desire to host a second instance which is externally accessible, which hosts repos that are publicly accessible, as well as those that are private to both internal users and a limited handful external users. The desire is for there to be repos that are both publicly accessible, those which require explicitly adding users. The restricted user feature was desirable because it enabled us to create repos which explicitly require adding external users, while being globally accessible to internal users. Making external users restricted would also be defense-in-depth for a repo accidentally being marked as limited instead of private.\n\nObviously, I can just not use the feature, and use some other approach like requiring explicitly adding all users for private repos, and disallow limited repos, or maybe running a third instance for these special repos, or using other software entirely. \n\nMy point in opening this issue is that the behavior is surprising and unintuitive, and will provides additional headaches to users who we will then have to explain that the tool that we're using won't let them see certain content if they are logged in, which doesn't exactly reflect well on either us or Gitea for that matter, which doesn't feel great since I generally prefer to support and give exposure to well-maintained FOSS projects if I can.\n\nIf the restricted user feature is only sensible to be used when public repos are disallowed, I would expect it to only be usable when that's the case, or for there to at least be some sort of UI element in the user creation/configuration page that says \"this doesn't do what you think it does, see this FAQ link\" if public repos are enabled.

don't think public repositories even make sense when sign-in is required. The point of a public repository is that you can see it without logging in, would it not make more sense to just have a feature to disallow public repos for that case?

Who knows, maybe there's a valid use case for disabling private repos?
