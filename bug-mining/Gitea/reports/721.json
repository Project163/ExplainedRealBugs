But I think it might relate to the total number of users in the organization (currently 25) or the time the user joined the instance.\nWhen searching for users to add to the branch protection rule it seems that newer users which joined the instance/organization just recently does not show up in the search.\n\nAny help or suggestions are welcome... 🙂 \n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.24.6\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nNo\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"1111\" height=\"256\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5dc7e69b-4539-4753-983d-0cebfda0abb7\" />\n\n### Git Version\n\n2.43.7\n\n### Operating System\n\nRocky Linux release 8.10 (Green Obsidian)\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nBinary distribution started via systemd unit\n\n### Database\n\nMySQL/MariaDB","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35499/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
