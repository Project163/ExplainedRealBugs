We have set `ARTIFACT_RETENTION_DAYS = 7` in the _actions_ section.\r\n\r\nThe build job actually says that artifact upload is succesful. But the next job, that tries to fetch the artifact fails:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\nTotal number of files that will be downloaded: 540\r\nA 500 response code has been received while attempting to download an artifact\r\nExponential backoff for retry #1.
