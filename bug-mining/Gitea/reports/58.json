This is e.g. useful for hiding automatic refactorings or bulk-reformattings from the history (https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-blameignoreRevsFile). It would be nice if Gitea would honour such file(s) in its blame view.\r\n\r\nWhile there is no \"standard\" file name for a repository-wide file for this feature, the name `.git-blame-ignore-revs` has been adopted by most projects (and is supported by GitHub):\r\n\r\n- https://moxio.com/blog/ignoring-bulk-change-commits-with-git-blame/\r\n- https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view\r\n- https://github.blog/changelog/2022-03-24-ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view-beta/\r\n- https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/how-to-exclude-commits-from-git-blame/\r\n\r\nGitLab would also use that filename when implementing this feature:\r\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/31423\r\n- https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/merge_requests/4177\r\n\r\nAs an example, here is a blame view which uses the file:\r\n- https://github.com/apache/maven/blame/master/maven-core/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/classrealm/DefaultClassRealmManager.java\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![grafik](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/assets/78534/e85c4e9d-4ce6-4676-9c9d-87c8a47c96b3)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"KN4CK3R","id":1666336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjYzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1666336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KN4CK3R","html_url":"https://github.com/KN4CK3R","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KN4CK3R/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KN4CK3R/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KN4CK3R/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KN4CK3R/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KN4CK3R/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KN4CK3R/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KN4CK3R/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KN4CK3R/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KN4CK3R/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26329/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
