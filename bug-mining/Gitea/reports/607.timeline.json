It does that by:\r\n1. Adding in web.go a new delete endpoint for the action that calls `action.Delete`. \r\n2. In the Delete function it gets the respective `ActionRun`  and `ActionRunJob` objects by run ID, starts a transaction and calls 2  lower-level functions at `models/actions/run.go`: `DeleteRun` and `DeleteRunJobs`.\r\n3. These lower-level functions will be responsible to do the DB operations to delete it.\r\n\r\nThis work is still in progress and I'm aware it needs more operations to really erase every remnant of the deleted Run.

help:\r\n\r\n- What you want delete is a `run`, so you need to delete a row of `ActionRun`.\r\n- A `run` could include multiple `jobs`, so you need to delete multiple rows of `ActionRunJob`.\r\n- When a `job` has been picked up by a runner to execute, there will be a `task`, however, a `job` could be rerun many times, so you need to delete multiple rows of `ActionTask`.\r\n- Every `task` could include\r\n  - multiple `steps`, so `ActionTaskStep`\r\n  - multiple `outputs`, so `ActionTaskOutput`\r\n- The log of the `task` is stored as a file (in DBFS or storage), so you need to detele it according to `ActionTask.LogFilename` or `ActionTask.LogInStorage`.\r\n- In addition, there may be some `artifacts` uploaded to the `run`, so you need to delete multiple rows of `ActionArtifact`.\r\n  - The files of `artifacts` are stored in storage, so you need to remove them.\r\n- Finally, update `NumActionRuns` and `NumClosedActionRuns` of `Repository`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/24256/reactions","total_count":37,"+1":37,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/24256/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2241047271","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26219#issuecomment-2241047271","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26219","id":2241047271,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx286Fk6rn","user":{"login":"Enrico204","id":8115660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTU2NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8115660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enrico204","html_url":"https://github.com/Enrico204","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enrico204/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enrico204/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enrico204/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enrico204/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enrico204/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enrico204/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enrico204/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enrico204/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Enrico204/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-20T08:41:30Z","updated_at":"2024-07-20T08:41:30Z","body":"I

Feature Description\n\n### Abstract\r\nI would like to put forward an idea for deleting obsolete data records for discussion before starting the implementation.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, I would offer the ability to delete obsolete action runs and associated entries from the database, if desired and configured by the administrator.\r\n\r\nThe idea is related to issue #24256.\r\n\r\nCurrently, obsolete artefacts (packages) are deleted and obsolete log entries are handled as part of a background process. \r\n\r\nIn future, the following database tables should also be taken into account:\r\n- ActionTaskStep\r\n- ActionTaskOutput\r\n- ActionRun\r\n- ActionRunJob\r\n- ActionTask\r\n\r\n### Concept/idea\r\nAdditional logic is implemented in the existing cleanup background process in the action package (services.actions.cleanup.go). This searches for ActionTasks with outdated logs (LogsExpired=true) and which are older than a configurable period `RunTaskRetentationDays`. The search logic is almost identical to `actions_model.FindOldTasksToExpire`. Based on the found ActionTasks, the associated data records are determined (TasksStep, TaskOutput, ActionRun etc.) and physically deleted.\r\n\r\n### Restrictions\r\n- The additional cleanup requires that the logs are already expired. This means that there is a time dependency between the existing cleanup and this additional logic.\r\n- RunTaskRetentionDays is implemented as a new configuration value analogue to LogRetentionDays. Due to the temporal interlocking, RunTaskRetentationDays is added to LogRetentionDays. This means that the log entries are cleared up after ten days, for example (LogRetentionDays=10) and the outdated action runs after fifteen days (RunTaskRetentionDays=5).\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\nEven after longer operation and many action runs, the UI with the action tab remains clear, as old actions that are no longer relevant are automatically tidied up and removed by a background process.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThis is my first involvement in this project. If I have misunderstood anything, I apologise. Therefore, I am not sure whether the deletion of action task is desired.\r\n\r\nIf this idea is in the spirit of the project, I can prepare a corresponding feature branch, but I would need some support with the implementation.\n\n###

Create a router endpoint (DELETE /actions/runs/{runID}) and API support for workflow run deletion.\r\n\r\n- Update the frontend to include a \"Delete\" button with a confirmation modal on the Actions page.\r\n\r\n- Add unit and integration tests to ensure proper functionality.\r\n\r\n- Optionally, implement a cron task for automatic cleanup of older runs based on retention settings.\r\n\r\nI’ll begin with the backend functionality and progress to frontend and
