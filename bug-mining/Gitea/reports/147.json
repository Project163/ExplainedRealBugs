It looks like these API routes are broken in a couple of ways.\r\n\r\n- First, I created a token with read + write access to all repos (non-admin user)\r\n<img width=\"667\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/assets/12700993/5ab7ca73-3806-4c58-863f-15e446fbe113\">\r\n\r\nThen, using that token on a repo I own:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X 'GET' \\\r\n  'https://try.gitea.io/api/v1/repos/kdumontnu/template/subscription' \\\r\n  -H 'accept: application/json' \\\r\n  -H 'Authorization: ---'\r\n```\r\nreturns a 500 error\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNext, when I try \"PUT\" or \"DELETE\", I get a 401 error. `\"token is required\"`. I should have access to this repo and I've provided all of the token routes.\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.22-dev\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\ntry.gitea.io\n\n### Database\n\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"lafriks","id":165205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTIwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/165205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks","html_url":"https://github.com/lafriks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28756/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
