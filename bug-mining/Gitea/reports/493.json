Give an option to disable the Sync Fork button globally, or for specific repos\r\n2. Ask for confirmation on clicking the Sync Fork button so it doesn't get clicked by accident (Bonus: With a diff / Pull Request like view on what it would do)\r\n3. As far as I understand it creates a Fake Pull Request and auto-merges it - Maybe only create the Pull Request without auto-merging it if possible. I think this might be the cleanest solution as this would enable one to cleanly check for external things that might have to be done.\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\n\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"techknowlogick","id":164197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDE5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick","html_url":"https://github.com/techknowlogick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
