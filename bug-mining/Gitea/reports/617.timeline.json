I am really sure it's not a timeout because waiting on the page works just fine)\n\nI hope the following context helps.

Is it possible that the context is cancelled when the request closes and some functions like `cmd.RunStdString` don't run to completion?\nMaybe this bug can be easily reproduced by adding a sleep to the `UpdatePullRequest` method, so that you have more time to cancel the request in your browser.
