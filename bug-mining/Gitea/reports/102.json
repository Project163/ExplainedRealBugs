I was a bit surprised by that. Notably, this also reproduces on the Gitea demo site.\r\n\r\nI then started looking into the documentation on how to create a PAT here: https://docs.gitea.com/development/api-usage#authentication. This does not seem to work either. The OTP-less first suggestion results in `{\"message\":\"Only signed in user is allowed to call APIs.\"}`, the one with OTP results in `[]` (empty JSON list).\r\n\r\nFinally, going into the UI as the instructions suggest is not helpful either, since it is not at all clear what permissions such a PAT would need for read-only and read-write access.\r\n\r\nSo there seem to be several issues here:\r\n\r\n 1. `docker login` should not succeed if account has 2FA enabled on it\r\n 2. Instructions for how to create a PAT should probably be updated\r\n 3. Documentation is needed for the minimal permission set required to only pull, and to pull+push to the Docker registry.\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.20.3\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nDocker compose using your downloads.
