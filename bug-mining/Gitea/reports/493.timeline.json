you asked, here's a little more detail on our use case:\r\n\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n- There is a main repository\r\n- Individual projects are forked from this main repository using the \"Branch to be cloned to the fork => main\" setting\r\n- Changes for the project are done in this main branch. There is no other branch kept around that would mirror upstream's main branch.\r\n- The main branch of the forked repository is set up in a way that the production environment for this project is always instantly kept in sync with the main branch, via git --mirror in a post-receive hook. We're not using actions - This might not be how you'd do it, but it really doesn't matter, because even if actions are not triggered on Sync Fork (which they probably should?), they will be triggered on the next normal push to the main branch that follows.\r\n\r\nNow the problem - Forget about SQL, lets focus on something more simple:\r\n- Upstream introduces a new mandatory config \"jwt_secret_key\" in a config.json file. It updates its config.json.example file as usual.\r\n- Somewhere in the code it says: `if config.jwt_secret_key is not set: throw exception \"jwt secret key is not set\"`\r\n- I now click the sync button, unaware right now of the new mandatory config, or I even click it by accident (because there's no confirmation)\r\n- There are no conflicts that would make the sync fail and the production environment syncs and breaks\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/33270 is sufficient to prevent this.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't take the possibility of breaking due to unawareness (which a possibility to disable the button would), but it at least prevents accidentally breaking everything.\r\n\r\nRight now I have to tell my Devs: \"Hey, there's a cool new Sync Fork button. But no matter how curious you are, do not click it, also be careful to not click it by accident and watch your cat not jumping on the keyboard, as there is no confirmation and it would instantly break our live system\"\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/33270 it's just \"Hey, there's a cool new Sync Fork button, but don't click it without consulting Tech-Lead before\" which is fine.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2589946582/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"noother","id":153409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/noother","html_url":"https://github.com/noother","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noother/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noother/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noother/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noother/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noother/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noother/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noother/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noother/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/noother/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15928486619,"node_id":"CE_lADOBFIx286mGigZzwAAAAO1aWrb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/15928486619","actor":{"login":"techknowlogick","id":164197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDE5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick","html_url":"https://github.com/techknowlogick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-14T18:30:45Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15928486667,"node_id":"CE_lADOBFIx286mGigZzwAAAAO1aWsL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/15928486667","actor":{"login":"techknowlogick","id":164197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDE5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick","html_url":"https://github.com/techknowlogick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"1299fdb0849cac862b00717070c27846075c2e85","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/commits/1299fdb0849cac862b00717070c27846075c2e85","created_at":"2025-01-14T18:30:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15928488114,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBFIx286mGigZzwAAAAO1aXCy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/15928488114","actor":{"login":"GiteaBot","id":24582011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTgyMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24582011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot","html_url":"https://github.com/GiteaBot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":fa
