the reason why #29101 is hard to replicate.\r\nRelated #29297\r\n\r\nCreate a repo with a file with minimum size 4097 bytes (I use 10000) and execute the following code:\r\n```go\r\ngitRepo, err := gitrepo.OpenRepository(db.DefaultContext, <repo>)\r\nassert.NoError(t, err)\r\n\r\ncommit, err := gitRepo.GetCommit(<sha>)\r\nassert.NoError(t, err)\r\n\r\nentry, err :=

`CatFileBatch`:\r\nhttps://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/79217ea63c1f77de7ca79813ae45950724e63d02/modules/git/repo_base_nogogit.go#L81-L87\r\n`Buffered() > 0` is used to check if there is a \"operation\" in progress at the moment. This is a problem because we can't control the internal buffer in the `bufio.Reader`. The code above demonstrates a sequence which initiates an operation for which the code thinks there is no active processing.
