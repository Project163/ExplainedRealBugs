This is extremely helpful, as repo URLs remain stable and do not have to be migrated on each client's worktree and other places, e.g. CI at once.\r\n\r\nThe SSH transport - which I favor - did not know of these redirections and I implemented a lookup during the `serv` command.\r\n\r\n**Considerations**\r\n\r\n- I am not a golang dev, feel free to suggest a more idiomatic implementation\r\n- This introduces DB lookups during the `serv` command. I am not sure how gitea handles this and if this may lead to performance or concurrency problems. My manual tests do not indicate any, but I'd be glad if an experienced contributor could verify this.\r\n- I haven't written any test cases yet. I'm a bit tired now but I try to commit them at a later time.\r\n- I did manual tests to verify correct handling of user rename and repo transfer though, also in combination.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35416/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35416/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/3259298620","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/30565#issuecomment-3259298620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/30565","id":3259298620,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx287CRPM8","user":{"login":"koalajoe23","id":26429,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/koalajoe23","html_url":"https://github.com/koalajoe23","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koalajoe23/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koalajoe23/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koalajoe23/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koalajoe23/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koalajoe23/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koalajoe23/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koalajoe23/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koalajoe23/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/koalajoe23/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-05T18:03:45Z","updated_at":"2025-09-05T18:03:45Z","body":"Took
