The perm check uses a very tricky way to avoid duplicate checks for a slice of issues, which is confusing. In fact, it's also the reason causing the bug. It uses `lastRepoID` and `lastPerm` to avoid duplicate checks, but forgets to assign the `lastPerm` at the end of the code block.

Description\n\nFollowing #27722 I decided to create separate issue for adding dependencies.\r\n\r\nI have an Organization with several repositories.\r\nRepository 1 have Issue R1_I1 and R1_I2\r\nRepository 2 have Issue R2_I1 and R2_I2\r\nR1_I2 depends on R1_I1\r\nR2_I2 depends on R2_I1\r\nand \r\nR2_I1 depends on R1_I1\r\nR2_I2 depends on R1_I2\r\n\r\nWhile adding in-repository dependencies it is okay, but when I try to add dependency for cross-repository issues, required issue is just not shown in dropdown.\r\n\r\nWhen I want to add R1_I1 as dependency for R2_I1 filter says nothing found, but if I wand to add R1_I2 as dependency, it magically displays R2_I1 .\r\nUsing this trick I can add one dependency, but not the other.\r\n\r\nOverall , in dependency dropdown some kind on random results are shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd I cannot reproduce this kind of problem on try.gitea.io\r\nbut on https://try.gitea.io/n.kobzarev/front_repo/issues/2 I'm unable to remove

Fix the typo `BlockingByDependenciesNotPermitted`, which causes the `not permitted message` not to show. The correct one is `Blocking` or `BlockedBy`\r\n2. Rewrite the perm check. The perm check uses a very tricky way to avoid duplicate checks for a slice of issues, which is confusing. In fact, it's also the reason causing the bug. It uses `lastRepoID` and `lastPerm` to avoid duplicate checks, but forgets to assign the `lastPerm` at the end of the code block. So I rewrote this to avoid this trick.\r\n![I U1AT{GNFY3 1HZ`6L{(2L](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/assets/70063547/79acd02a-a567-4316-ae0d-11c6461becf1)\r\n3. It also reuses the `blocks` slice, which is even more confusing.
