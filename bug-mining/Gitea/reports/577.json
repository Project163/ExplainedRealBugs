This happens on different repositories.\n\nHappy to try and submit a PR on my own if needed, I want to confirm whether this is an actual bug or not first.\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.23.6\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\nFrom repo home page (with the issue):\n<img width=\"779\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b16f2fa-5803-4112-aee2-c78ded0b908c\" />\n\nFrom README file context:\n<img width=\"826\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e407e301-05a8-45e2-b928-fe886ed74a66\" />\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nSelf hosted rootless container using Podman\n\n### Database\n\nSQLite","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34188/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
