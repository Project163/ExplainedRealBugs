Description\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> Please understand that the content may be awkward as it was translated using a translator.\n\nHello,  \n\nI am using `gitea-version-gogit-windows-4.0-amd64.exe` and running Gitea as a Windows service.  \n\nTo enable HTTPS, I am using Let's Encrypt and have applied the following ACME-related settings in my `app.ini` file:  \n\n**[app.ini]**\n```\nPROTOCOL = https\nDOMAIN = r**.e**.co.kr\nENABLE_ACME = true\nSSH_DOMAIN = r**.e**.co.kr\nACME_ACCEPTTOS = true\nACME_DIRECTORY = https\nACME_EMAIL = g**@e**.co.kr\nHTTP_PORT = 443\nROOT_URL = https://r**.e**.co.kr\nAPP_DATA_PATH = F:\\gitea/data\nDISABLE_SSH = false\nSSH_PORT = 22\nOFFLINE_MODE = false\nREDIRECT_OTHER_PORT = true\nPORT_TO_REDIRECT = 80\n```\n\nWith this configuration, Gitea worked fine up to **version 1.23.4**.  \nHowever, after updating to **1.23.5**, the service fails to start.  \nWhen running the executable manually, I see the following error messages:  \n\n```\n2025/03/05 23:16:39 cmd/web.go:364:listen() [E] Failed to start server: r**.e**.co.kr: obtaining certificate: [r**.e**.co.kr] Obtain: registering account [mailto:g**@e**.co.kr] with server: provisioning client: performing request: Get \"https:\": http: no Host in request URL\n2025/03/05 23:16:39 cmd/web.go:366:listen() [I] HTTP Listener: 0.0.0.0:443 Closed\n```\n\nTo provide more details, I have attached logs from both **1.23.4 (working version)** and **1.23.5 (failing version)** for comparison.  \n\n**[logs]**\n- [gitea_log_1.23.4_success.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19092566/gitea_log_1.23.4_success.txt)\n- [gitea_log_1.23.5_failed.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19092567/gitea_log_1.23.5_failed.txt)\n\nCould this issue be related to recent ACME updates?\nIf I revert to **1.23.4** without changing the ACME configuration, Gitea runs without any issues.  \n\nPlease investigate this issue.  \nThank you!\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.23.5\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nNo\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n2.48.1\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows Server 2019 (1809)\n\n### How are you running
