This behavior is no longer functioning in version 1.23.7. \n\n**Steps to reproduce**:  \n1. Open the issue or pull request label selector.\n2. Search for a label.\n3. In version 1.22.1, the first label would be auto-selected, and pressing `Enter` would add it.\n4. In version 1.23.7, the first label appears to still be highlighted, but pressing `Enter` does not add it, and the user must manually click the label with the mouse to add it.\n\n**Expected behavior**:  \nAbility to add the filtered labels by pressing `Enter`.\n\n**Actual behavior**:  \nUsers must click the filtered labels manually.\n\n**Version**:  \nGitea 1.23.7 (working fine in 1.22.1)\n\n**Additional Information**:  \nThis change seems to have been introduced after 1.22.1, and it affects both the issue and pull request label selectors. If that is too broad of a version range I can try to pin it down to a specific version.\n\nTested on https://demo.gitea.com/loncardom/test/issues/1 which is running 1.24.0 and the issue persists.\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.23.7\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5af4983-5135-4dbc-bbca-e1479f14bb23)\n\nThe label `bug` appears to be highligted but pressing `Enter` does nothing\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nRunning Gitea through docker, though this issue is reproducible on try.gitea.io\n\n\n\n### Database\n\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34300/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
