This can waste API calls which, especially when unauthorized, could be somewhat limited depending on what other API requests are peformed and how frequent.\r\n\r\nAnother example could be a repository where you update the default branch whenever a new major release of your project is released, which would cause old URLs to break (Should you not keep them) or link to possible outdated sources, requiring you to update them.\r\nWith this feature could you keep the same URL and it would automatically redirect to the right file on the default branch.\r\n\r\nRegarding the \"name\" of the branch would I go with `~` as it works in browsers and can't be used in a branch name itself, making it a perfect candidate to have for this function, without overriding any existing branch names a user may have.\r\n\r\nAs an example, assume a repository having a branch labeled `main`. Using `{user}/{repo}/src/branch/~/README.md` would be equal to `{user}/{repo}/src/branch/main/README.md`.\r\nIf the repo now has its default renamed to `default` would `{user}/{repo}/src/branch/~/README.md` now be equal to `{user}/{repo}/src/branch/default/README.md`\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26920/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
