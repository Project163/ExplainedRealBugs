#30696 by @lunny\n\n# The problem\r\nThe previous implementation will start multiple POST requests from the frontend when moving a column and another bug is moving the default column will never be remembered in fact.\r\n\r\n# What's changed\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR will allow the default column to move to a non-first position\r\n- [x] And it also uses one request instead of multiple requests when moving the columns\r\n- [x] Use a star instead of a pin as the icon for setting the default column action\r\n- [x] Inserted new column will be append to the end\r\n- [x] Fix #30701 the newly added issue will be append to the end of the default column\r\n- [x] Fix when deleting a column, all issues in it will be displayed from UI but database records exist.\r\n- [x] Add a limitation for columns in a project to 20.
