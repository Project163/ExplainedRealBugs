Feature Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the Project page contains columns whose height are defined by either a minimal value or a fraction of the available viewport.\r\n<img width=\"423\" alt=\"Capture d’écran 2024-07-21 à 00 58 18\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10e7b0e6-29d5-403b-a0f4-8b541b80fa0b\">\r\n\r\nIf this looks pleasing on large screens — on smaller screens (using a Macbook 14\"), browsing 30+ issues is not ideal:\r\n- Its harder to have an overview of the kanban board\r\n- Peeking or Seeking issues is more complexe\r\n- Browsing issues require a lot of individual scroll actions \r\n- Scrollbars eat up each column available surface, especially for user on Windows 10 and below and some Linux Distros, some browsers or specific (accessibility) settings\r\n- Searching issues (via browser text search — a.k.a `Ctrl+F`) doesn't correctly scroll down to the highlighted match (tested on Firefox)\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1353\" alt=\"Capture d’écran 2024-07-21 à 01 05 35\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c21ad871-512b-435e-a313-f2c300c36186\">\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI propose to instead set the Project board to take as much space a needed by its content:\r\n- Can make the webpage veeeeeeeery long\r\n- 1 global scrollbar\r\n- More effective peeking for issues\r\n- Scroll to the match when text searching\r\n- Access to the page footer is longer\r\n- 1 line of code to implement?\r\n<img width=\"1518\" alt=\"Capture d’écran 2024-07-21 à 01 17 00\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c54a5514-0038-4f82-8fa0-f0f72635a870\">\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt's easy to test an implementation by deleting the `height: calc(100vh - 450px);` rule from `.project-column` selector in `index.css §9711`:\r\n\r\n```CSS\r\n.project-column {\r\n  background-color:var(--color-project-board-bg)!important;\r\n  border:1px solid var(--color-secondary)!important;\r\n  margin:0 .5rem!important;\r\n  padding:.5rem!important;\r\n  width:320px;\r\n  height:fit-content;\r\n  /*height:calc(100vh - 450px);*/\r\n  min-height:60vh;\r\n  flex:0 0 auto;\r\n  overflow:visible;\r\n  display:flex;\r\n  flex-direction:column;\r\n  cursor:default\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Could that help make the Kanban board easier and quicker to use?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Jira board 2024](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwac-cdn.atlassian.com%2Fdam%2Fjcr%3A22f4ff3a-3f0a-4a23-b4c1-d74bd63dc724%2Fhow-kanban-works.png%3FcdnVersion%3Dht&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=0cd8effba8b61a986b03aff98db43d7b84037ab06a9254ded36105683f271ea1&ipo=images)\r\n![Jira board 2020](https://merehead.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/scram-jira.jpg)\r\n![Github](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/memex-view-board-cebeb9984e53.png)","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31666/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31666/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
