so important update,\nAfter reading this in the docs:\n`The default option will interrogate git config for commit.gpgsign option`\nI did some testing and found out, that **you can already make gitea sign these commits with an SSH key and it's quite simple**.\nIssue is now that it will show the commit without a green lock in the interface when you view it:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e3d6a3-08a1-4d60-b4bd-7525f5f36812)\nI did confirm that this commit is signed by the SSH key I added though.\n\nHere is what I did.\n* Exec into the container \n* run `mkdir /data/gitea/home/.ssh`\n* Run `ssh-keygen` and create a keypair in `/data/gitea/home/.ssh`\n* Run `chown -R 1000:1000 /data/gitea/home/.ssh`\n* Edit `/data/gitea/home/.gitconfig` and add the following (add to section if it already exists):\n```\n[user]\n    signingKey = /data/gitea/home/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub\n[commit]\n    gpgsign = true\n[gpg]\n    format = ssh\n```\n* Finally add the following to the app.ini\n```\n[repository.signing]\nSIGNING_KEY=default\nSIGNING_NAME=Gitea\nSIGNING_EMAIL=git@domain.com\nWIKI=always\nCRUD_ACTIONS=always\nMERGES=always\n```\n(not sure if SIGNING_NAME and SIGNING_EMAIL do anything in this case)\n\nThis will make gitea sign Merge/CRUD/init commit but sadly gitea will not accept it as a valid signign key and show the commits without a green lock symbol.\nIs there a way already to tell gitea that this key should be \"trusted\" ?\n\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2843188946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brtwrst","id":6873862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NzM4NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6873862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brtwrst","html_url":"https://github.com/brtwrst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brtwrst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brtwrst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brtwrst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brtwrst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brtwrst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brtwrst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brtwrst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brtwrst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brtwrst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2843208421","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34329#issuecomment-2843208421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34329","id":2843208421,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx286pd-rl","user":{"login":"ChristopherHX","id":44845461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODQ1NDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44845461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX","html_url":"https://github.com/ChristopherHX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-30T20:30:06Z","updated_at":"2025-04-30T20:30:06Z","body":">
