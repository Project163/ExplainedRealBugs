I'm willing to take a stab at implementing this since it seems pretty simple, if the team/community is open to it.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34867/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
