for the report! This is unattended behavior... https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/31970 should have removed the commit description and just kept the summary:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/41b4ef825dba14f11b2e9454692b999f92ee1a42/services/webhook/discord.go#L159\r\n\r\nHere we split the commit message with `\\n` as the delimiter and we only choose the first line. It also removes any trailing `/r` if it exists.\r\n\r\nLooking at the Go [docs](https://pkg.go.dev/strings#SplitN) further, I may have misused `SplitN()` and should have done:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nstrings.SplitN(commit.Message, \"\\n\", 2)[0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n... since the last element would be the \"unsplit remainder\" that the docs talk about. Currently we seem to be using the unsplit remainder (which would just be the message). Reading the code of `strings.SplitN()` also points to this being the case. That PR also had a unit test, but didn't catch this edge case since the commit summary was > 50 (while yours is < 50).\r\n\r\nNot sure how I missed this.

this.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2458484951/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kemzeb","id":60799661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzk5NjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60799661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb","html_url":"https://github.com/kemzeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15132667653,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOBFIx286cSbbEzwAAAAOF-i8F","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/15132667653","actor":{"login":"kemzeb","id":60799661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzk5NjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60799661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb","html_url":"https://github.com/kemzeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-06T00:49:26Z","label":{"name":"type/proposal","color":"5319e7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15132667659,"node_id":"LE_lADOBFIx286cSbbEzwAAAAOF-i8L","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/15132667659","actor":{"login":"kemzeb","id":60799661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzk5NjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60799661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb","html_url":"https://github.com/kemzeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-06T00:49:26Z","label":{"name":"type/bug","color":"ee0701"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15132677913,"node_id":"LE_lADOBFIx286cSbbEzwAAAAOF-lcZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/15132677913","actor":{"login":"kemzeb","id":60799661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzk5NjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60799661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb","html_url":"https://github.com/kemzeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-06T00:49:56Z","label":{"name":"topic/webhooks","color":"d646ca"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"kemzeb","id":60799661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzk5NjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.g
