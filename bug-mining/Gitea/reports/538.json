Description\n\nI'm working with renovate which makes calls to `api/v1/repos/org/repo/pulls?state=all&sort=recentupdate&page=[page]`. At pages 8+ the requests take a long time. Looking at htop it's because the git diff command is blocking. \r\nThis is likely because my repo had a large restructure, loading the diffs on the gitea web app is also very slow.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/usr/bin/git -c protocol.version=2 -c credential.helper= -c filter.lfs.required= -c filter.lfs.smudge= -c filter.lfs.clean= diff --shortstat [left]...[right]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there any way to cache diffs or any config I can use to speed them up? My current workaround is to set the request timeout to 5 min in renovate\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.22.0\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nNo\n\n### Log Gist\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/GammaGames/b1ae6715c8a66da638ee181ed6f93da1\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![image](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/assets/7832163/8458e759-ff7b-44aa-a813-9408e4411ede)\r\n\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nDocker compose:\r\n```yaml\r\nservices:\r\n  gitea:\r\n    image: gitea/gitea:1\r\n    container_name: gitea\r\n    environment:\r\n      USER_UID: 1001\r\n      USER_GID: 1001\r\n    restart: unless-stopped\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - ./gitea:/data\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 127.0.0.1:3001:3000\r\n      - 127.0.0.1:2222:22\r\n```\n\n### Database\n\nSQLite","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31492/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31492/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
