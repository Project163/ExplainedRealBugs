Create a repository with actions enabled\r\n2. Create a file `/.gitea/workflows` with the content `not a number`\r\n3. Create a file `/.github/workflows` with the content `not a number`\r\n4. Open the page `/<owner>/<repo>/actions`\r\n5. If no error is shown, refresh the page multiple times until an error occurs\r\n\r\nThe reason is this code\r\nhttps://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/ce9978bfd4e035ed065b02b28e02905674320b6a/modules/actions/workflows.go#L47-L50\r\n\r\nwhich fails in line 179\r\nhttps://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/ce9978bfd4e035ed065b02b28e02905674320b6a/modules/git/batch_reader.go#L152-L181\r\n\r\nIf the error occurs the code tries to parse `not a number` as output of the batch reader. A normal output looks like `8b2bfd3a117fcb7ae93f93616cb2f7a9706c513a tree 104`. I don't know how the content of a file can be present here. And even worse is that it does not fail every time. If I create only one `workflows` file it does not fail but that may just be a timing issue.\r\n\r\n### Git Version\r\n\r\n2.43.0, non-gogit","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/29101/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/29101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
