@wxiaoguang so should I try `nightly` again while adding the headers to the docker `v2` block or wait until a patch?\r\n\r\nNo patch for logic change at the moment.\r\n\r\n\"Improve reverse proxy documents #31003\" is a document improvement:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Make sure `Host` and `X-Fowarded-Proto` headers are correctly passed to Gitea to make sure Gitea sees the real URL being visited.\r\n\r\n### Use a sub-path\r\n\r\nUsually it's **not recommended** to put Gitea in a sub-path, it's not widely used and may have some issues in rare cases.\r\n\r\nIf you really need to do so, to make Gitea work with sub-path (eg: `https://common.example.com/gitea/`),\r\nhere are the extra requirements besides the general configuration above:\r\n\r\n1. Use `[server] ROOT_URL = https://common.example.com/gitea/` in your `app.ini` file.\r\n2. Make the reverse-proxy pass `https://common.example.com/gitea/foo` to `http://gitea:3000/foo`.\r\n3. If you'd like to use container registry, the container registry uses a fixed sub-path `/v2` in the root, which is unchangeable and required by container registry standard.\r\n   - Make reverse-proxy pass `https://common.example.com/v2` to `http://gitea:3000/v2`.\r\n   - Make sure the URI and headers are also correctly passed (see the general configuration above).\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo you could use nightly and add these headers to the `/v2` nginx config section.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2117862501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12850280097,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBFIx286JMbQpzwAAAAL977ah","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/12850280097","actor":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-17T15:35:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12850280109,"node_id":"SE_lADOBFIx286JMbQpzwAAAAL977at","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/12850280109","actor":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-17T15:35:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2117912974","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31002#issuecomment-2117912974","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31002","id":2117912974,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx285-PMmO","user":{"login":"jessielw","id":48299282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Mjk5Mjgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48299282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessielw","html_url":"https://github.com/jessielw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessielw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessielw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessielw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessielw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessielw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessielw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessielw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessielw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jessielw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-17T16:01:14Z","updated_at":"2024-
