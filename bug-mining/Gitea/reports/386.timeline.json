act\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nact -v --artifact-server-path build -j x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Describe issue\r\nupload-artifact@v4 does produce corrupted archives in some cases.  I have no idea why because the log does not hint any issue at all:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n[build/x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc]   💬  ::debug::File:/home/vinci/Develop/VSCode/act_upload_artifact_v4/build.tar was found using the provided searchPath\r\n| With the provided path, there will be 1 file uploaded\r\n[build/x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc]   💬  ::debug::Root artifact directory is /home/vinci/Develop/VSCode/act_upload_artifact_v4\r\n| Artifact name is valid!\r\n| Root directory input is valid!\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've attached the archive produced from act and the original one from GitHub:\r\n[corrupted.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15551228/corrupted.zip)\r\n[original.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15551234/original.zip)\r\n\r\nThe very same workflow works for me when using the older upload-artifact@v3.\r\n\r\nI've also created a small test example where this is easily reproducible.\r\n\r\n### Link to GitHub
