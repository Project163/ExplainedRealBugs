In Chinese articles like https://www.yuque.com/linghengqian/meve2v/amyuk4s35t5ze394 , if GitLab CE is started via Docker Container, the user has a series of Bash commands similar to the following to send a test email to a real mailbox. This will start the interactive shell of the GitLab CE container and use GitLab CE's internal tool `gitlab-rails console` for testing. This type of operation can completely bypass the Web UI.\r\n- The `katyreid@outlook.com` here is a fake email. \r\n```shell\r\ndocker compose up -d\r\ndocker compose exec gitlab-ce /bin/bash\r\ngitlab-rails console\r\nNotify.test_email('katyreid@outlook.com', 'Message Subject', 'Message Body').deliver_now\r\n```\r\n- For operations similar to #28335, when I sent a test email in the Web UI, the information printed by Gitea in the Web UI was relatively short. In contrast, GitLab CE emits a full error stack when executing a command like `Notify.test_email('katyreid@outlook.com', 'Message Subject', 'Message
