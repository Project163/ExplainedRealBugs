(I get it might still be e-mailed and shown to some people but that's not the same at all like it lingering forever on the internet.) However, that only works when it's possible **to delete old revisions of your own edited comments, which I'm hereby proposing.** GitHub by the way has been offering this for quite a while already. Or alternatively, do it like GitLab and just don't show older versions or any comment history at all. This in between where all older versions of a comment are kept forever but there seems to be no obvious way to delete them seems like a very unfortunate in-between.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the UI to pick and show an old version in a popup where just a single button for deletion would need to be added, is already there. So UI-wise, this change seems really minor. I hope it can be added.\r\n\r\nSure, it's still possible to delete an entire comment instead to \"solve\" this, but that seems like quite the nuclear option. It would be better to do it like GitHub, where you can delete an old version of the comment but then it also still shows transparently if you check that the older version existed but that it was deleted. That seems like the best of all worlds.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/27313/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/27313/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
