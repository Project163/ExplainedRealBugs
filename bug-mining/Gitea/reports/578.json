There is no way to do an exact name search.\n\n-> Please add a flag to do an exact name search. \n\nBackground:\nOur repository is very, very big with lots of nuget packages (100k packages and counting) that share parts of the same name, like  a base package `package.name.part` and lots of specialized packages like `package.name.part.subA`, `package.name.part.subB`, ...\n\nthere is no way to filter for `package.name.part`, as it will always include all other packages aswell. This makes it impossible to do a performant lookup of what is present in the registry. Or is there? \nCurrently I query the whole registry which takes about 5 minutes to finish using `package/listPackages` with not q filter and do the grouping in code. \nEarlier I used the nuget api directly, but it is much slower than `listPackages`.\n\n-> It would be nice to have an API where the latest version of each package could be fetched, and then an API to get all versions of an package. \n\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33544/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
