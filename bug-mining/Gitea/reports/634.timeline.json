I can only add a team to a branch protection rule, if I gave it \"Administrator Access\". Granting \"General Access\" and ticking \"write\" for every row in the permission table is not enough.\n\nI guess, either \"Code\" or \"Projects\" write access should be enough to add a team to a branch protection rule.\n\nThe issue seems to be, that the branch protection looks for the \"authorize\" field in the team database table. Changing the permission table does not mutate that field, only granting the team Administrator access sets the value to 4.\n\nOne can \"upgrade\" a team by executing `update team set authorize=2 where

Granting \"General Access\" and ticking \"write\" for every row in the permission table is not enough.\n> \n> I guess, either \"Code\" or \"Projects\" write access should be enough to add a team to a branch protection rule.\n> \n> The issue seems to be, that the branch protection looks for the \"authorize\" field in the team database table. Changing the permission table does not mutate that field, only granting the team Administrator access sets the value to 4.\n> \n> One can \"upgrade\" a team by executing `update team set authorize=2 where id=<id>;` (2 is sufficient, 3 or 4 work as well).\n> \n> This seems undocumented or buggy to me, but should be an easy fix.\n\nIt was version 1.23.X, not the latest. After I upgraded to the latest version quickly, I had a similar issue like this one haha.\n\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2997759587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"smoslinux","id":19647960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjQ3OTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19647960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoslinux","html_url":"https://github.com/smoslinux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoslinux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoslinux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoslinux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoslinux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoslinux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoslinux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoslinux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoslinux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smoslinux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2998248810","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34793#issuecomment-2998248810","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34793","id":2998248810,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx286ytaVq","user":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-23T23:12:36Z","updated_at":"2025-06-23T23:12:36Z","body":"Sorry for the regression ... the \"team permission\" system has some legacy problems. \n\n\nBy the way, do you know which page is it ? https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34793#issuecomment-2997013682 I can't remember or find it .....
