it looks like I am right. I changed my operating system to use a European date and time and I can now see the chart data. I'll see if I can make a patch for this (not a frontend wizard but I have read some of the code last night)!","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2093762796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kemzeb","id":60799661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzk5NjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60799661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb","html_url":"https://github.com/kemzeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2093985549","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/30851#issuecomment-2093985549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/30851","id":2093985549,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx2858z68N","user":{"login":"kemzeb","id":60799661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzk5NjYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60799661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb","html_url":"https://github.com/kemzeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kemzeb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-04T03:23:06Z","updated_at":"2024-05-04T03:23:06Z","body":"Alright

The problem with this was that the Sundays are in Unix epoch time and when we changed the \"startDate\" argument that was passed to make sure it is on a Sunday, this change would be reflected when we convert it to Unix epoch time. More specifically, I observed that we may get different Unix epochs depending on your timezone when the returned list should rather be timezone-agnostic.\r\n\r\nThis led to issues in US timezones that caused the contributor, code frequency, and recent commit charts to not show any chart data. This fix resolves this by using getter/setter methods that work with UTC since it isn't dependent on timezones.\r\n\r\nFixes

The problem with this was that the Sundays are in Unix epoch time and when we changed the \"startDate\" argument that was passed to make sure it is on a Sunday, this change would be reflected when we convert it to Unix epoch time. More specifically, I observed that we may get different Unix epochs depending on your timezone when the returned list should rather be timezone-agnostic.\r\n\r\nThis led to issues in US timezones that caused the contributor, code frequency, and recent commit charts to not show any chart data. This fix resolves this by using getter/setter methods that work with UTC since it isn't dependent on timezones.\r\n\r\nFixes

`TAGS=\"bindata sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify\" make build`\r\n- `./gitea web`\r\n- Created a repository and made 3 commits\r\n\r\nAnd haven't been able to reproduce.\r\n\r\nI went to your instance to see if I can gather any useful insights and that's where I noticed that the backend is sending **negative** Unix times.

negative Unix times since they represent times  before the Unix epoch.\r\n\r\nGiven these results, I believe that this is a problem in the backend and we should maybe create a bug report for
