This can cause seeking to fail when playing videos from the browser (direct from LFS storage), among other issues.\n\nTo demonstrate, I've uploaded a 56 byte LFS text file and ran the following commands:\n\n```sh\n\n> gitea -v\nGitea version 1.24.3 built with GNU Make 4.4.1, go1.24.5 : bindata, timetzdata, sqlite, sqlite_unlock_notify\n\n> curl -v  http://localhost/owner/repo/info/lfs/objects/a2323ab55f9a6dbaecd5a8284c0391166e260f6d8e129ac973733e5765a8e7c8\n...\n< content-length: 56\n...\n\n> curl -H \"Range: bytes=10-\"  -v  http://localhost/owner/repo/info/lfs/objects/a2323ab55f9a6dbaecd5a8284c0391166e260f6d8e129ac973733e5765a8e7c8\n...\n< content-range: bytes 10-55/46\n...\n```\n\nTo be RFC compliant, the last output should read `content-range: bytes 10-55/56`.\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.24.3\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n1.24.3\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nInside a kubernetes pod container.\n\n### Database\n\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35276/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
