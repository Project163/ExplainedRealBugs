The same workflow works without issues on version 1.24.0.\n\n## Steps to reproduce  \n1. Build Docker image with `docker build`  \n2. Log in to the Gitea registry with `docker login`  \n3. Push the image using `docker push`  \n4. Push fails with `ERROR: EOF`  \n\n## Expected behavior  \nDocker image should push successfully, as it does in Gitea 1.24.0.\n\n## Actual behavior  \nPush is interrupted by an unexpected `EOF`, resulting in incomplete upload.\n\n## Environment  \n- Gitea version 1.24.1 (failing)  \n- Gitea version 1.24.0 (working)  \n- Docker version 28.2.2  \n- Local network and storage, no MTU or network issues\n\nPlease investigate and fix this regression as it breaks CI/CD workflows relying on Docker image pushes.\n\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.24.1\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nNo\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n# Version 1.24.1\n![1.24.1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d55de56f-2323-43e1-8f9c-d56843646251)\n\n# Version 1.24.0\n![Version 1.24.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15c30eb4-253f-44c8-8247-c599adb8afac)\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\nDocker Linux x86\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nDocker Compose\n\n### Database\n\nPostgreSQL","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34792/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
