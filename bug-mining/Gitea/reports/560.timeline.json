Open browser console to see more details.\n\nI noticed Gitea's web interface started using `WeakRef` (noticed when posting a reply to a PR review conversation).\nPlease note that UXP doesn't implement `WeakRef` and its usage is not recommended unless you explicitly want to give hints to the JS GC for the release of (overly large) memory. Even so there is no guarantee that a JS engine will honour those hints, as they have often very complex internal machinery to deal with garbage collection. Letting content interfere with this process is not desirable; UXP doesn't intend to implement this as a result (potential can of worms also for security considerations as it might open UAFs and the like).\n\nPlease consider removing `WeakRef` usage from Gitea's web interface. There should not be a reason for using it to begin with. Let the engine do its own housekeeping. There is currently the risk of JS scripting breaking if it runs into `WeakRef` being undefined errors.\n\n### Screenshots\n\nI didn't think of capturing the error box\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.23.1\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10 22H2\n\n### Browser Version\n\nPale Moon 33.5.1","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33407/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2780708940","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33966#issuecomment-2780708940","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33966","id":2780708940,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx286lvkBM","user":{"login":"richmahn","id":2839925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4Mzk5MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2839925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richmahn","html_url":"https://github.com/richmahn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richmahn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richmahn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richmahn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richmahn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richmahn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richmahn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richmahn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richmahn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richmahn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-05T12:56:46Z","updated_at":"2025-04-05T12:57:02Z","body":"@wxiaoguang  Was there any change to the admin config settings page to reflect this?

It does this via  [`codel`](https://github.com/bohde/codel), which will perform the following:\r\n\r\n1. Limit the number of in-flight requests to some user defined max\r\n2. When in-flight requests have reached their max, begin queuing requests, with logged in requests having priority above logged out requests\r\n3. Once a request has been queued for too long, it has a percentage chance to be rejected based upon how overloaded the entire system is.\r\n\r\nWhen a server experiences more traffic than it  can handle, this has the effect of keeping latency low for logged in users, while rejecting just enough requests from logged out users to keep the service from being overloaded.\r\n\r\nBelow are benchmarks showing a system at 100% capacity and 200% capacity in a few different configurations. The 200% capacity is shown to highlight an extreme case.

Anti-crawler action: respond 503, redirect to login, show a JS page to do some proof-of-work or use some rate limit token (this one seems to provide best user experience).\n\nThen end users could choose a combination to satisfy their requirements.\n\n----\n\nTo answer your question:\n\n1. I think  \"block expensive pages\" + \"show a JS page with PoW or rate limit token\" should work for you (the \"action\" is not implemented yet)\n2. The `compare` endpoint is also heavy, but I think at the moment since other pages have been blocked, so the crawlers won't see it, so I guess it won't be a problem?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2785893126/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2785896969","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33966#issuecomment-2785896969","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33966","id":2785896969,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx286mDWoJ","user":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-08T09:58:59Z","updated_at":"2025-04-08T09:58:59Z","body":"> not being able to view issues strikes me as too much.\n\nFor this one: would you like to build your own binary to allow the \"issues\" related endpoints?
