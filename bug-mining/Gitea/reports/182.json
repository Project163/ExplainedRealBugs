From my understanding, assigned events should work but they trigger nothing.\r\n\r\nWhat could be the causes? (and also, I probably should open another issue for this question but will `review*` types could be supported on workflows as they are handled by webhooks?)\r\n\r\nI created a simple repo that can reproduce the issue [here](https://try.gitea.io/gfjdhgdf/pr_ci_tests/): the actions are launched for `labeled` and `unlabeled` but not for every other type trigger. EDIT: when the only label is removed, the called workflow is the one containing `labeled`, not `unlabeled` \r\n\r\n### Gitea Version\r\n\r\n1.21.1\r\n\r\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Log Gist\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Git Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### How are you running Gitea?\r\n\r\nI followed the docs on how to launch gitea using systemd, and the binary runs on bare-metal without any containerization\r\n\r\n### Database\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/29166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/29166/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
