This, however, does not happen if the issues tab is disabled in the repo settings and produces a \"404 Not Found\" when visiting `.../issues/17`. The effect of this is not only that mistyped urls won't be fixed for you, but (and this is much more of a problem) gitea relies on this mechanism internally. When referencing an issue/PR number in a commit message (eg. `foo bar baz (fix #17)`), gitea will add an anchor to this number on the website, which will always be of the form `/{user}/{repo}/issues/{number}`, even if the number referenced by the commit message is in fact a PR.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Visit this repo: https://git.tjdev.de/tjdev/dns-watch-2022\n2. See the commit message `🩹 get reference list working (#17)`\n3. Click on the green `#17`\n4. Note how you get a 404 page\n5. Now click on the _Pull Requests_ tab\n6. See how there actually is a PR with number `#17`\n7. Now if I would enable the issues tab for this repo, step 3 would actually take you to the correct PR page\n\n### Gitea Version\n1.24.5\n","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35419/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
