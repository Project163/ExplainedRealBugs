I propose we start sorting by relevance (i.e., by `_score`). \r\n\r\nThis will be needed by #32096 (I've noticed this while coding it), as GitHub's search considers matches in filenames more relevant than those in content. Moreover, Sorting by relevance seems more sensible than sorting by the `repo_id`.\r\n\r\nIf you guys are ok with it, I'll open a PR.\r\n\r\nP.S. It was hard to decide if this was a bug or a feature. In the end, I went with the latter since the code search does work.\r\n\r\nP.S. Both [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/sort-search-results.html) and [Bleve](https://blevesearch.com/docs/Sorting/) allow sorting by relevance.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32129/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
