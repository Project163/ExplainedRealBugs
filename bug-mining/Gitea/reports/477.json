Create an empty repo from your profile\r\n2. empty repo shows last updated `now`\r\n3. wait after 1 minute\r\n4. empty repo at profile shows last updated 1 minute ago (expected)\r\n5. revisit the empty repo's home page, then back to the profile page for the repo list\r\n6. empty repo shows last updated `now` (**unexpected**)\r\n\r\n6 is unexpected since we at step 5 do nothing. Suppose the timestamp should stay fixed.\r\n\r\nI will create a PR for this. This is a tiny bug.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nAt step 6, the last update time should grow.\r\n\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n40765b5\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![Snipaste_2025-01-06_15-09-07](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fc043aa-096d-4843-830c-d02ed699414b)\r\n![repo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c993df18-ba8b-474e-9ca2-b294c04e80b4)\r\n![view_home](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcaded4c-4214-41d0-b1e6-070df58c9d82)\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nGitea Demo and Ubuntu sqlite3 latest commit local build\n\n### Database\n\nSQLite","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33119/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33119/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
