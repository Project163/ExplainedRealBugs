I suppose this happens because the function attempts to access `pds[len(pds)-1]`, but `pds` is empty.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Ensure no package versions exist for the given `GroupID:ArtifactID`.\n2. Attempt to curl GET `com/group/id/artifactId/maven-metadata.xml` for the non-existent package.\n3. Get 500 response and see the log with `index out of range [-1]` panic.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nThe function should return more clear HTTP response (e.g., `404 Not Found`) instead of panicking.\n\n## Where I think the problem is\n\nrouters/api/packages/maven/maven.go\nfunc serveMavenMetadata\n```go\nlatest := pds[len(pds)-1] // Panics if pds is empty\n```\n\n## Suggested Fix\n\nAdd a check for package versions found before continuing:\n\n```go\npvs = append(pvsLegacy, pvs...)\n\nif len(pvs) == 0 {\n\tapiError(ctx, http.StatusNotFound, packages_model.ErrPackageNotExist)\n\treturn\n}\n```\n\n## Environment\n\n- **Gitea Version:** 1.23.5\n- **Go Version:** 1.23.5\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.23.5\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nLocally\n\n### Database\n\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33886/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
