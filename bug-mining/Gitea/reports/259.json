Description\n\nThe `<dependencies>`-element parsing of metadata in .nuspec file is incomplete.\r\nFollowing [nuspec dependencies documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec#dependencies)  `<dependency>`-elements like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependencies>\r\n    <dependency id=\"PackageA\" version=\"1.1.0\" include=\"contentFiles, build\" />\r\n    <dependency id=\"PackageB\" version=\"[1,2)\" exclude=\"native, compile\" />\r\n</dependencies>\r\n```\r\ncan be \"stand-alone\" or grouped (for target frameworks).\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependencies>\r\n    <group>\r\n        <dependency id=\"RouteMagic\" version=\"1.1.0\" />\r\n    </group>\r\n\r\n    <group targetFramework=\".NETFramework4.7.2\">\r\n        <dependency id=\"jQuery\" version=\"1.6.2\" />\r\n        <dependency id=\"WebActivator\" version=\"1.4.4\" />\r\n    </group>\r\n\r\n    <group targetFramework=\"netcoreapp3.1\">\r\n    </group>\r\n</dependencies>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly the second one is implemented in gitea and mandatory for \"error-free\" parsing of .nuspec files.\r\n\r\nAs a result `dependency`-elements outside `group`-elements are ignored and missing in the output of metadata for the nuget package.\r\n\r\nTested on demo site with a random nuget [package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/rb.Firefox#dependencies-body-tab)  with dependencies.\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the following screenshot of metadata no dependencies are listed:\r\n![image](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/assets/24730923/bc0bc8cc-67f9-48cd-a29d-d8b6e0d9b73c)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Gitea Version\n\nv1.21.10\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo
