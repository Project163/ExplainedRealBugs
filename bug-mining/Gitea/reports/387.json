Description\n\nHi,\r\n\r\nit looks like there is a permission issue so that team members can't rename branches.\r\n\r\nI can reproduce it like this:\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an organization **O** with a Team **T**. \r\n\r\nThe Team **T** has access to `specific repositories` with `General access` and at `Allow Access to Repository Sections` every section is set to **write**.\r\nThen I add user **X** to the Team **T** .. **X** is NOT an owner of the organization.\r\n\r\nThen I create a repository **REPO** inside the organization **O** and add the team **T** to it.\r\nThe user **X** now has the permission to add and delete a branch in **REPO**, but renaming a branch leads to a 404 error message.\r\n\r\nThe log output is\r\n```\r\ngitea-1    | 2024/09/06 09:25:21
