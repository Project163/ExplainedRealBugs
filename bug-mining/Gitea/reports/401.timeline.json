This is by design.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/900ac622514081b90e08135cab175d5d1ea1bc9d/services/actions/notifier_helper.go#L118-L125\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue, you can [create a new token](https://docs.gitea.com/next/development/api-usage#generating-and-listing-api-tokens) that includes write permission to the repo. And use this token in your workflow like\r\n\r\n```\r\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\r\n        with:\r\n          token: ${{ secrets.YOUR_TOKEN }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the changes pushed to the repo will be able to trigger workflow detection so that the schedule tasks will use the latest ref.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnd I'm also thinking that we should allow Gitea to re-detect schedule tasks even if the doer is \"ActionsUser\". I did some testing on GitHub and found that changes pushed by the \"ActionsUser\" are also able to trigger updates to schedule tasks.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2408361599/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Zettat123","id":15528715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTI4NzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15528715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123","html_url":"https://github.com/Zettat123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"Zettat123","id":15528715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTI4NzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15528715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123","html_url":"https://github.com/Zettat123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-12T05:45:54Z","updated_at":"2024-10-12T05:45:54Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32246","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32246/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32246/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32246/events","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/32246","id":2582576085,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBFIx285-Za_w","number":32246,"title":"Update scheduled tasks even if changes are pushed by \"ActionsUser\"","user":{"login":"Zettat123","id":15528715,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTI4NzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15528715?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123","html_url":"https://github.com/Zettat123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zettat123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":472744938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0NzI3NDQ5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/labels/type/bug","name":"type/bug","color":"ee0701","default":false,"description":""},{"id":475283668,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0NzUyODM2Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/labels/lgtm/done","name":"lgtm/done","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"This PR has enough approvals to get merged.
