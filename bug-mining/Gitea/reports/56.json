Description\n\nHeader only conan packages can generate an empty `conaninfo.txt`, due to\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef package_id(self):\r\n    self.info.clear()\r\n```\r\n\r\n`gitea` is currently ignoring such files, which appears to be due to https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/e502be46f3ac5f1075abd96bd9b326a4c1f7e96f/routers/api/packages/conan/conan.go#L328-L332 which breaks the `conan` client when trying to consume such packages:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntuplet/2.1.1: ERROR: Exception while getting package: da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709\r\ntuplet/2.1.1: ERROR: Exception: <class
