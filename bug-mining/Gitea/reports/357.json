Retrieving a token via `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/runners/registration-token`, as referenced in `${GITEA_URL}/api/swagger`, returns a 404 error.\r\n\r\n2. By examining related API calls, I added `/actions` to the endpoint. This adjustment does return a token for a runner mapped to a repository, but it differs from the token displayed in the repository's Actions settings in the web UI.\r\n\r\nMoreover, using this token allows the registration of a runner. However, it will **only process the first job assigned after a restart.**\r\n\r\n### Gitea Version\r\n\r\n1.22-rootless\r\n\r\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Log Gist\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/floriankessler/b7b3a141b11edd34e8867f423ddd3acb\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Git Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### How are you running Gitea?\r\n\r\nsee gist\r\n\r\n### Database\r\n\r\nSQLite","closed_by":{"login":"techknowlogick","id":164197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDE5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick","html_url":"https://github.com/techknowlogick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31707/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31707/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
