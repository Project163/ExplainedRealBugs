In older versions of Gitea (1.23.x), this was not an issue, and markdown tables rendered correctly.\n\nThis behavior occurs in Both Firefox and Chromium. Here is a demo site repro of the problem: https://demo.gitea.com/witten/test/wiki/Home\n\nAnd here is the markdown in question:\n\n```md\n# example repro\n\n| date       | description | mileage | vendor\n| ---------- | ----------- | ------- | --------\n| 2024-12-08 | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipiscing elit.
