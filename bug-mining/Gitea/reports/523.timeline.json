you!\n\nSo far I came up with the following workaround.\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\n1. You should create a technical user with access to artifacts, but without 2FA and put its username and password into Actions Secrets under `ACTIONS_USERNAME` and `ACTIONS_PASSWORD` variables accordingly.\n2. `unzip` package should be installed on the server.\n3. You must know name of the organization (`env.ORG_NAME` variable) and the repo (`env.REPO_NAME` variable).\n4. You must know exact name of the artifact (`env.ARTIFACT_NAME` variable) you want to download and the build ID (`env.BUILD_ID` variable).\n\n**How to**\nCreate a step which will download and extract artifacts into `input` folder:\n```\n      - name: Artifact download\n        shell: bash\n        run: |\n          mkdir input\n          cd input\n          curl --request POST \\\n            --url ${{ gitea.server_url }}/user/login \\\n            --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n            --data 'user_name=${{ secrets.ACTIONS_USERNAME }}' \\\n            --data 'password=${{ secrets.ACTIONS_PASSWORD }}' \\\n            --cookie-jar gitea_cookies.txt\n          curl --fail --output build_artifacts.zip \\\n            --url ${{ gitea.server_url }}/${{ env.ORG_NAME }}/${{ env.REPO_NAME }}/actions/runs/${{ env.ARTIFACT_NAME }}/artifacts/${{ env.ARTIFACT_NAME }} \\\n            --cookie gitea_cookies.txt\n          unzip build_artifacts.zip\n          rm build_artifacts.zip gitea_cookies.txt\n```\nThis step basically mimics user actions: performs login in Gitea, downloads artifacts via generated link and unzips them.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2611708010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"this-username-has-been-taken","id":119663930,"node_id":"U_kgDOByHtOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/119663930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/this-username-has-been-taken","html_url":"https://github.com/this-username-has-been-taken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/this-username-has-been-taken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/this-username-has-been-taken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/this-username-has-been-taken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/this-username-has-been-taken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/this-username-has-been-taken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/this-username-has-been-taken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/this-username-has-been-taken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/this-username-has-been-taken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/this-username-has-been-taken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16143304417,"node_id":"SE_lADOBFIx286nIU7BzwAAAAPCN0bh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/16143304417","actor":{"login":"eof228","id":18029203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDI5MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18029203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228","html_url":"https://github.com/eof228","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-31T16:59:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16143307254,"node_id":"UE_lADOBFIx286nIU7BzwAAAAPCN1H2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/16143307254","actor":{"login":"eof228","id":18029203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDI5MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18029203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228","html_url":"https://github.com/eof228","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eof228/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unsubscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-31T17:00:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ChristopherHX","id":44845461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODQ1NDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44845461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX","html_url":"https://github.com/ChristopherHX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-05T16:14:41Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T16:14:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/3351
