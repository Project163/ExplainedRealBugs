(I am not sure if this is supposed to be working like this - as for github)\r\nAn example would be a workflow like this:\r\n```\r\nname: Do Not Merge\r\n\r\non:\r\n  # Check label at every push in a feature branch\r\n  push:\r\n    branches-ignore:\r\n      - main\r\n  # Check label during the lifetime of a pull request\r\n  pull_request:\r\n    types: [synchronize, opened, reopened, labeled, unlabeled]\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n  do-not-merge:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04\r\n    steps:\r\n      - name: Fail if PR is labeled with do not merge\r\n        if: contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'do-not-merge')\r\n        run: |\r\n          echo \"This PR can't be merged, due to the 'do-not-merge' label.\"\r\n          exit 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving branch rules protection to main (default) branch I would be able to disable merging by adding \"do-not-merge\" label.\r\nCurrently, on 1.23-nightly, the action is run, but status check will show the initial state for the PR. I need to add another commit to the PR to have a new state for the \"do not merge\" check\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33051/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
