Description\n\nWhen having an open PR with commits already added and showing up in the \"timeline\", I'd expect a force push to be shown correctly in the timeline with some link to the diff of the force push.\n\nTo reproduce: \n\n- added two commits to a branch\n- opened a PR\n- drop the last commit\n- do a force push\n- check the timeline on the PR\n\n\n\nThis was working in earlier versions of gitea.\n\nReproduced on Gitea Demo Site [1]\n\n[1] https://demo.gitea.com/smartEBL/test/pulls/1\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.24.6\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\nWhat I get:\n<img width=\"1005\" height=\"406\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91e6295c-7348-48d1-b7a1-c4d61a1d9b08\"

Version\n\n2.49.1\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 22.04\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nGitea runs in a docker container using the official gitea docker image.\n\n###
