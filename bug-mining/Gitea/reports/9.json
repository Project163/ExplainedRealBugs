However I don't see how to add issues to this project. Tried few things.\r\n\r\n1. From projects page `https://try.gitea.io/<username>/-/projects/<project_id>`, don't see any option to add issue \r\n2. Created an issue in of the repository. Create page `https://try.gitea.io/<username>/<repo_name>/issues/new has a 'Projects' setting on the setting. But don't see the user project in this list. \r\n3. Project does not show up in issue listing page or the issue page\r\n4. Tried assigning the project to the user and still don't see any option to add to a user project.\r\n\r\nIs there any way other way to use the user project ?\r\n\r\nLink: https://try.gitea.io/balki/-/projects/3724\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.21.0+dev-408-geaea530d6\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nhttps://try.gitea.io/\n\n### Database\n\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26189/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
