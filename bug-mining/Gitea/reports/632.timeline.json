You can find the workflow file [here](https://gist.github.com/jacopo-j/62bc84c07ec3f4d25cd62348de141aa5).\n\nDuring the publishing phase, the workflow fails with the following error:\n\n```\n::error::buildx failed with: ERROR: bad range format: 0--1\n```\n\nYou can find the whole workflow log [here](https://gist.github.com/jacopo-j/c936a5cfc5bfedf566664bc56aeed1aa), the error is at line 530-535.\n\nI could not find any specific information regarding that error message, neither here nor elsewhere online. However, it likely comes from a response from the Gitea container registry.\n\nBy changing the workflow to publish the image con docker.io rather than my Gitea instance, everything works without errors, suggesting that the issue is not with a malformed Docker image (which I tried to re-build multiple times, by the way), but with the container registry itself.\n\n### Gitea

I am still curious about some details (why the error could happen). My guess is that the problem is possibly related to docker's version. I have tried docker (desktop) client 27.x/28.x, they all succeed to push.\n\nSo if you have time, could you take a look at the `docker version`? And if the client is old and it is possible, could you try to upgrade to a new/latest version to try? Thank you
