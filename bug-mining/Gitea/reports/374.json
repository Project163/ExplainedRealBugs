When a pull request is manually merged, the automatic closing behavior of referenced issues is not triggered as expected.\r\n\r\nFor example, I had a pull request with the description “This PR closes #909090”. After manually merging the pull request, issue #909090 was not automatically closed, and no notification was created on the issue as the documentation suggests should happen.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is inconsistent with the feature’s description, which states that issues should be closed if the merger of the pull request has the necessary permissions. I do have the permissions to close the issue, but the actionable reference did not take effect upon merging.\r\n\r\nThis bug affects the workflow for issue tracking and resolution, as it requires manual intervention to update the issue status after merging a PR. It could lead to inconsistencies in the issue tracking system and additional workload for the team.\r\n\r\nCould you please look into this issue and advise on how it can be resolved? It’s an important feature for maintaining our issue tracking efficiency.\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this matter. Keep up the great work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Gitea Version\r\n\r\n1.23.0+dev-345-gecc8f2b047\r\n\r\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Log Gist\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nAttached on https://forum.gitea.com/t/actionable-references-not-triggering-on-manually-merges/9525\r\n\r\n### Git Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### How are you running Gitea?\r\n\r\nAll actions could reproduce via demo.gitea.com\r\n\r\n### Database\r\n\r\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31743/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
