Most git commands cannot recognize the zero commit id. To get the changed files in the push, we need to get the first diverge commit of this branch. In most situations, we could check commits one by one until one commit is contained by another branch. Then we will think that commit is the diverge point.\r\n\r\nAnd in a pre-receive hook, this will be more difficult because all commits haven't been merged and they actually stored in a temporary place by git. So we need to bring some envs to let git know the commit exist.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31778/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13778844848,"node_id":"CE_lADOBFIx286RS8vFzwAAAAM1SHyw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/13778844848","actor":{"login":"wolfogre","id":9418365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MTgzNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9418365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre","html_url":"https://github.com/wolfogre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-06T13:32:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13778844898,"node_id":"CE_lADOBFIx286RS8vFzwAAAAM1SHzi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/13778844898","actor":{"login":"wolfogre","id":9418365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MTgzNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9418365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre","html_url":"https://github.com/wolfogre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"df7f1c2eadac24f64adf3d823a7642a6eccf77f3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/commits/df7f1c2eadac24f64adf3d823a7642a6eccf77f3","created_at":"2024-08-06T13:32:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13779729837,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBFIx286RS8vFzwAAAAM1Vf2t","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/13779729837","actor":{"login":"ExplodingDragon","id":33776693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzc2Njkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33776693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExplodingDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/ExplodingDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExplodingDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExplodingDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExplodingDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExplodingDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExplodingDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExplodingDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExplodingDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExplodingDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ExplodingDragon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"df7f1c2eadac24f64adf3d823a7642a6eccf77f3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ExplodingDragon/gitea/commits/df7f1c2eadac24f64adf3d823a7642a6eccf77f3","created_at":"2024-08-06T14:31:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13794314775,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBFIx286RS8vFzwAAAAM2NIoX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/13794314775","actor":{"login":"GiteaBot","id":24582011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTgyMDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24582011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot","html_url":"https://github.com/GiteaBot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GiteaBot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/

So we need to bring some envs to let git know the commit exist.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31796/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13800479708,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBFIx286RS8vFzwAAAAM2kpvc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/13800479708","actor":{"login":"silverwind","id":115237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind","html_url":"https://github.com/silverwind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8d11946d67043535dec850c7872d895e77e3afbe","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/commits/8d11946d67043535dec850c7872d895e77e3afbe","created_at":"2024-08-08T03:08:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15113335903,"node_id":"LOE_lADOBFIx286RS8vFzwAAAAOE0zRf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/15113335903","actor":{"login":"go-gitea","id":12724356,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNzI0MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12724356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-gitea","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-gitea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-gitea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-gitea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-gitea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-gitea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-gitea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-gitea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-gitea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/go-gitea/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-05T03:43:32Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
