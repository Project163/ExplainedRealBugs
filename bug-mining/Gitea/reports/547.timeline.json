have a wait-and-see attitude towards this proposal.  \r\n\r\nRegarding running safely in host mode, my first instinct is:  \r\n-  Do not register a new act_runner every time.  \r\n-  The concurrency of tasks for the registered runner can only be 1, so during the execution of a task, the runner will not fetch a second one. (This is my biggest concern about the proposal; when the runner is not suitable for receiving new tasks, it should not FetchTask, rather than letting the FetchTask function decide whether to assign tasks.)  \r\n-  When executing tasks, once the execution is successful, do not immediately fetch the next task. Instead, clean up the env or even rebuild the virtual machine.  \r\n-  When starting a new runner in new env, reuse the local state file of the previously registered runner so that it can be recognized and accepted by Gitea without needing to register again.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo clarify, in the current design, Gitea does not actively assign tasks to runners; it only attempts to assign a new task when a runner requests one (if available). The purpose of this design is to allow the runner to decide for itself whether it is ready to receive more tasks, while Gitea only determines if there are new tasks to assign.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2467205171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wolfogre","id":9418365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MTgzNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9418365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre","html_url":"https://github.com/wolfogre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15244100942,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBFIx286duK43zwAAAAOMnoVO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/15244100942","actor":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f888e45432ccb86b18e6709fbd25223e07f2c422","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/commits/f888e45432ccb86b18e6709fbd25223e07f2c422","created_at":"2024-11-11T04:58:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2467522049","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32461#issuecomment-2467522049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32461","id":2467522049,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx286TE2YB","user":{"login":"ChristopherHX","id":44845461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODQ1NDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44845461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX","html_url":"https://github.com/ChristopherHX","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChristopherHX/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-11T08:27:45Z","updated_at":"2024-11-11T08:27:45Z","body":">

If you need to spin up, register, run the act, and then tear it down.  Either, you need a third party piece of software to do this orchestration or it gets built into gitea.  I think what would make sense to define a lightweight orchestration protocol. Third parties could use this to create complex orchestrations (i.e. running across many disparate  hosts/platforms.) and gitea could implement simple orchestration on the local host.  For many users, a simple host/docker only orchestration solution built into gitea would be highly beneficial.\n\nWe should make it as easy as possible for ephemeral runners to be used.

These register, do work for a short amount of time and then get deleted. It seems there is currently no way to programmatically remove runners from repos/orgs and it has to be done by hand in the web ui.\n\nThe following functions would be really useful for me:\na) a way to retrieve runner info (esp. Status and \"Last online Time\") via the REST API\nb) a way to delete runners via the REST API\nc) a way for a runner to deregister itself via the grpc API (not a replacement for a) since the runner cannot be trusted to deregister itself)\n\nI had look through the Rest API, grpc api and there currently (1.24 dev) doesnt seem to be a way to do this. I also didnt find any issues for gitea or act_runner that already discuss this.\n\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No

@cobak78,\n\nI skimmed over your discussion, while I'm planning to only implement the workflow_run + workflow_job endpoints defined by GitHub in Gitea instead of brewing our own like you seem to have done for Forgejo. This means for example using github_runner scaler of keda instead of creating a Gitea specific one, my initial test seems to show the queue metric can be calculated from my POC branch without webhooks or code changes to keda.\n\nIf you trust everyone who gains access to queue Jobs on your Forgejo instance, please ignore the rest of my post.\n\nI would suggest that you audit the security of your Forgejo runner long living credentials when using labels with `:host`, since only the `:docker://` labels can protect the credential file, without using the feature discussed here, based on my knowledge from the Gitea runner and nektos/act.\n\nMy goal of ephemeral runners in Gitea is, even if the long living runner credentials are exposed to a non trusted job that they become invalid for accessing additional write tokens + secets by fetching additional tasks that everybody can do with read access to the runner credential file (you make use of the reusability of this file content as a feature).\n\nI saw inside your gist an kubernetes internal dns name for the runner creds to Forgejo, this means for exploiting this outside of kubernetes you need to know the public endpoint of gitea if this is not already leaked inside the job in `GITHUB_SERVER_URL`, but afaik the original registration domain is not recorded on the server to block access.\n\nFor a private or proof of concept instance your approach is perfectly fine 👍
