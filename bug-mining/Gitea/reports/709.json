In Rust projects, for example, multiple mod.rs files may exist at different paths such as `repo/api/mod.rs` and `repo/types/mod.rs`, but they all display the same page title.\n\n-  `https://***gitea***/org/rust-project/src/branch/master/src/api/mod.rs`\n-  `https://***gitea***/org/rust-project/src/branch/master/src/types/mod.rs`\n\n**current page title** : `rust-project/mod.rs at master - rust-project - Gitea:***`\n\n**Expected Behavior**: The page title should include the full file path, similar to GitHub’s format.\n\n- `gitea/assets/emoji.json at main - go-gitea/gitea` [Gitea Repo link](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/main/assets/emoji.json)\nOR\n- `/api/mod.rs at master - rust-project - Gitea:***`\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1319\" height=\"282\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef0be828-8b6b-42a3-99c8-c52dc2678744\" />\n\n\n\n-----------\n\n\n### Feature Request Description\n\n\nUpdate the browser tab title (document.title) to show the currently viewed file when a user clicks on a file in the file tree.\n\nCurrently, when navigating between files via the file tree, the page title remains static. This can make it difficult to identify which file is currently open, especially when working across multiple tabs. \n\n\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/51640162\n\n@bytedream — you previously worked on the [Ctrl + Click navigation issue](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35461), I believe this change might be in same section of the code. Would you be open to taking a look?\n\n\nThank you\n\n### Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"810\" height=\"240\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49245029-51e4-47b6-a818-4d695d273882\" />\n\n<img width=\"1132\" height=\"312\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f0d5ea2-66ab-4703-aee1-33cf486194b9\" />","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35749/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35749/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
