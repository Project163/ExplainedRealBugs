The relevant part in the documentation basically says: [Go find out how to set that up yourself](https://docs.gitea.com/next/administration/signing#installing-and-generating-a-gpg-key-for-gitea) which has been a pain point for many users over the years and for myself as well.\n\nNow that commit signing with SSH keys has been available for some time, would it be possible to use SSH keys for these commit signatures as well? Could be as simple as putting a private key in a specific .folder (maybe `%(APP_DATA_PATH)/home/.ssh` ) along with a \"use ssh key for commit signing\" setting under the `[repository.signing]` section in the app.ini. \n\nThoughts?","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34329/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
