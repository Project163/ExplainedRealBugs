Description\n\nI upgraded my gitea instance to version 1.21.7.\r\nWhen I open certain PR's which already have a conversation/comments attached, I get the following error:\r\n```\r\nRender failed, failed to render template: repo/pulls/files, error: template error: builtin(bindata):repo/diff/conversation:4:45 : executing \"repo/diff/conversation\" at <0>: nil pointer evaluating
