you need to work on a feature which depends on another (unmerged) feature.\r\nIn this case, you may create a PR based on that feature instead of the main branch.\r\nCurrently, such PRs will be closed without the possibility to reopen in case the parent feature is merged and its branch is deleted.\r\nAutomatic target branch change make life a lot easier in such cases.\r\nGithub and Bitbucket behave in such way.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n$PR_1$: main <- feature1\r\n$PR_2$: feature1 <- feature2\r\n\r\nCurrently, merging $PR_1$ and deleting its branch leads to $PR_2$ being closed without the possibility to reopen.\r\nThis is both annoying and loses the review history when you open a new PR.\r\n\r\nWith this change, $PR_2$ will change its target branch to main ($PR_2$: main <- feature2) after $PR_1$ has been merged and its branch has been deleted.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is enabled by default but can be disabled.\r\nFor security reasons, this target branch change will not be executed when merging PRs targeting another repo. \r\n\r\nFixes #27062\r\nFixes
