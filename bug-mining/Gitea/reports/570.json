The escaping is to set brackets apart from Markdown links à la `[abc](https://example.com)`. Markdown formatters like [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) or [mdformat](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat) escape brackets in various places, accidentally producing Gitea math. (See [here](https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat/issues/112) for the corresponding mdformat bug.)\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/27602/.\r\n\r\n_Edit:_ [I've surveyed math syntaxes and performance on GitHub, Gitea, GitLab.](https://nschloe.github.io/2023/11/16/the-state-of-math-in-markdown.html#comparison-table). Gitea's bracket-syntax is unique and hence not compatible. The backticked syntax is sorely missing from Gitea, especially given its great performance on the other platforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Gitea Version\r\n\r\n 1.22.0+dev-188-g1be49fdda\r\n\r\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Log Gist\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Git Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### How are you running Gitea?\r\n\r\nhttps://try.gitea.io/\r\n\r\n### Database\r\n\r\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/27645/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/27645/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
