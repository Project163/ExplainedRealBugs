Hi @gilbertoca . I've seen the print-screen. I think your problem is that you get a \"The email address is invalid\" error when you change the \"Maximum Number of Repositories\".\r\n> \r\n> Is the `EMAIL_DOMAIN_ALLOWLIST` configuration of your Gitea instance is empty? Could you add your email domain (like `ibrowser.net.br`) to the allowlist and then check if you can successfully change the \"Maximum Number of Repositories\"?\r\n> \r\n> After testing, we will be able to know if the error is caused by the `EMAIL_DOMAIN_ALLOWLIST` configuration.\r\n\r\n@Zettat123 @lunny \r\nI can confirm this behavior. I've just added this domain in the **EMAIL_DOMAIN_ALLOWLIST** and now I can change the **Maximum Number of Repositories**\r\n\r\nWe have about six smtp as **Authentication Source**. I have to add all of them in the **EMAIL_DOMAIN_ALLOWLIST** and stop/start the service.\r\nI think this is counterintuitive usage for admins!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/1973100739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gilbertoca","id":3083703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODM3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3083703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca","html_url":"https://github.com/gilbertoca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11978848828,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBFIx285y5oB_zwAAAALJ_ro8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/11978848828","actor":{"login":"gilbertoca","id":3083703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODM3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3083703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca","html_url":"https://github.com/gilbertoca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-01T12:26:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11978848837,"node_id":"SE_lADOBFIx285y5oB_zwAAAALJ_rpF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/11978848837","actor":{"login":"gilbertoca","id":3083703,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODM3MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3083703?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca","html_url":"https://github.com/gilbertoca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilbertoca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-01T12:26:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
