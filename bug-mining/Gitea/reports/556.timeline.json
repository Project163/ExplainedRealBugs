But neither the dependency nor the dependency of the dependency repo maintainers are responding to any sort of attempted contact. If they would, it could be solved for anyone using that dom-range module. Ultimately that means it _becomes_ a Gitea problem because you chose to rely on this (clearly unmaintained) dependency, which unnecessarily attempts to reach deep into the js machinery with WeakRef for no other reason than it \"being a thing\".\nIt's not like I didn't try to get the root issue fixed. I have.\n\nI am well aware that it would be preferable to implement at least a stub WeakRef in the browser (which would be there just to satisfy use without fallback of WeakRef and not do anything otherwise) and that is [on our to-do list](https://repo.palemoon.org/MoonchildProductions/UXP/issues/2689) but it is proving a lot more complicated than it should be because of the complexities of our inherited SpiderMonkey engine.\nOf note also is that GitHub doesn't have this issue Gitea has (I have no trouble getting a proper pop-up on issue mention that works and is clickable, etc. which is broken because of WeakRef in Gitea) and Gitea has been the only web GUI so far I've encountered that breaks on it not being present. \"many sites\" is an overstatement.
