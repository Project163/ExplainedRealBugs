Is it a bug or by design?\r\n\r\nIf it's a bug (I think it is), then this issue will track it.\r\n\r\nIf it's by design:\r\n- It's common to use an admin account to interact with an app, even when managing other users' accounts. So this behaviour is very surprising.\r\n- I specified that I wanted to act on the `bob` account, not the `admin` account.\r\n- If this cannot be fixed/changed, then at least those API endpoints should return errors. If it will ignore the account that I specified and use the authenticating account instead, it must return an error rather than perform an action I didn't request.\r\n- The docs should reflect this weird behaviour (I looked but couldn't find anything).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n### Gitea Version\r\n\r\n1.20.2\r\n\r\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Log Gist\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Git Version\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n### How are you running Gitea?\r\n\r\ndocker\r\n\r\n### Database\r\n\r\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"silverwind","id":115237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind","html_url":"https://github.com/silverwind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
