You can find the workflow file [here](https://gist.github.com/jacopo-j/62bc84c07ec3f4d25cd62348de141aa5).\n\nDuring the publishing phase, the workflow fails with the following error:\n\n```\n::error::buildx failed with: ERROR: bad range format: 0--1\n```\n\nYou can find the whole workflow log [here](https://gist.github.com/jacopo-j/c936a5cfc5bfedf566664bc56aeed1aa), the error is at line 530-535.\n\nI could not find any specific information regarding that error message, neither here nor elsewhere online. However, it likely comes from a response from the Gitea container registry.\n\nBy changing the workflow to publish the image con docker.io rather than my Gitea instance, everything works without errors, suggesting that the issue is not with a malformed Docker image (which I tried to re-build multiple times, by the way), but with the container registry itself.\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.24.0\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nNo\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n2.30.1\n\n### Operating System\n\nmacOS 11.6.3\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nNative using pre-build binaries for macOS\n\n### Database\n\nMySQL/MariaDB","closed_by":{"login":"lafriks","id":165205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTIwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/165205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks","html_url":"https://github.com/lafriks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34724/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
