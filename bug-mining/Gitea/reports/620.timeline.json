done some more tests, today and indeed seems that the group information is not passed properly. I have made sure that in the token provided by authelia there is a \"groups\" claim, in this case, without membership to the gitea_admin group:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c160617f-4c57-47ad-9ee4-bbf48960e569)\n\nI have also added the flag ```--group-claim-name groups``` to the add-oauth call, and now I am starting to log in (first user after a database wipe) with an unprivileged user... and it shows as if it was an admin :-O!\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aaee6d09-8f28-444a-84c3-eeefa34c5896)\nJust for the record, there is no other user in the database:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/375c1436-108d-44c4-88e1-324acf2ddb44)\nSo.... what's wrong?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2873789956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"flixman","id":11373728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzczNzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11373728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman","html_url":"https://github.com/flixman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2888469548","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34358#issuecomment-2888469548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34358","id":2888469548,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx286sKows","user":{"login":"flixman","id":11373728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzczNzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11373728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman","html_url":"https://github.com/flixman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flixman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-17T15:55:46Z","updated_at":"2025-05-17T15:55:46Z","body":"@techknowlogick @0dragosh with version 1.23.8 the problem is that the first user is set as admin no matter what.

Maybe I am looking at this the wrong way, but what I am aiming towards to is: I want to have all the identities provided externally, in this case by Authelia. With my current configuration, when I get to gitea -> sign in, I just get a button to use authelia login (I'd like this to happen without having to click the button, but I think is not possible?) and then have the information about users, groups, etc., sent over by Authelia. All this works, as long as the first user in gitea is an admin.\n\nI guess this should be stated as a requirement somewhere? Having an app relying only on externally provided ids is not that a corner case
