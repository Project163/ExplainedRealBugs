Description\n\nWhen trying to filter commits on a repo where the commit message have the type of commit enclosed in square brackets, e.g. \"[build] Update libraries to next mayor version\", the search doesn't behave as expected.\r\nThe different cases I tried were:\r\n- When you search for a tag enclosed in square brackets, e.g. \"[build]\", it shows a bunch of results that doesn't match the search.\r\n- when you search for a tag but missing the starting square bracket, e.g. \"build]\", the search gives the correct results.\r\n- when you search for a tag enclosed in square brackets and escape the opening bracket, e.g. \"\\\\[build]\", the search gives the correct results.\r\n- when you search only for an opening square bracket, e.g. \"[\", it shows an error page.\r\n- when you search only for an opening square bracket and escape it, e.g. \"\\\\[\", it shows all the commits that have an opening square bracket which is the correct result.\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.21.0\n\n###
