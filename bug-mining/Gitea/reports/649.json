I have a couple of repositories that I need to orchestrate for a combined release process (aka poly repo) with a script:\n\n1. have main/dev branch + a simple workflow action,e.g. `exit 0`\n2. create a release branch with changes\n3. create PRs from that said release branch to main/dev\n4. immediately trigger auto merge\n5. repeat for up to 5 repositories\n\nRepository settings: default, merge commit, no status checks or any branch protection (tested with many configurations).\n\nWith that workflow, the automerge feature gets stuck after the first repository almost always. To recover from this, I can simply add a success to that particular commit (via API). Alternatively, `sleep 30 && exit 0` as workflow action resolves this issue too.\n\nAfter diving into the code I suspect that there might an issue with the [notification of commit statuses](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/f88800d54505f30dbae089d446e292f176222d99/services/automerge/notify.go#L51): the pull request [might still check if it is mergeable](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/f88800d54505f30dbae089d446e292f176222d99/services/pull/check.go#L395) and thus the automerge is not triggered.\n\nThis is also reproducible with a single repository and creating many branches + PRs + auto merge requests with a script. Roughly 50% of automergeable PRs get stuck with this:\n\nCreate a sample repository, e.g. I've cloned gitea/helm-gitea and used this repository with the script below.\n\n```shell\nenv GITEA_HOST=git.example.com OWNER=My_User REPOSITORY=test-repo USERNAME=My_User PASSWORD=an_application_token ./reproduce-automerge-stuck.sh\n```\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# filename: reproduce-automerge-stuck.sh\n\nset -eu -o pipefail\n\nGITEA_HOST=\"${GITEA_HOST:-demo.gitea.com}\"\n\nUSERNAME=\"${USERNAME:-}\"\nPASSWORD=\"${PASSWORD:-}\"\n\nOWNER=\"${OWNER:-posativ}\"\nREPOSITORY=\"${REPOSITORY:-automerge-issue}\"\n\nif [[ -z \"$USERNAME\" || -z \"$PASSWORD\" ]]; then\n  echo \"Please set USERNAME and PASSWORD environment variables.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nautomerge() {\n  TEST_BRANCH=\"test-branch-$(date +%s)\"\n  TEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)\n  trap 'rm -rf \"$TEMP_DIR\"' EXIT\n\n  # clone + config\n  git clone --depth 1 \"https://${USERNAME}:${PASSWORD}@${GITEA_HOST}/${OWNER}/${REPOSITORY}\" \"$TEMP_DIR/repo\"\n  cd \"$TEMP_DIR/repo\"\n\n  git config user.name \"foo\"\n  git config user.email \"bar@example.com\"\n\n  # Create a new branch and commit changes\n  git checkout -b \"$TEST_BRANCH\"\n  echo \"$(date +%s)\" > \"$TEST_BRANCH.txt\"\n  git add \"$TEST_BRANCH.txt\"\n  git commit -m \"Add test file\"\n\n  sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)\n\n  git push origin \"$TEST_BRANCH\"\n\n  # set commit status to pending\n  curl -vX POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -u \"$USERNAME:$PASSWORD\" \\\n    -d '{\"context\": \"foo\", \"description\": \"bar\", \"state\": \"pending\", \"target_url\": \"https://example.com\"}' \\\n    \"https://${GITEA_HOST}/api/v1/repos/${OWNER}/${REPOSITORY}/statuses/${sha}\"\n\n  # CI or something\n  sleep 1\n\n  # set commit status to success\n  curl -vX POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -u \"$USERNAME:$PASSWORD\" \\\n    -d '{\"context\": \"foo\", \"description\": \"bar\", \"state\": \"success\", \"target_url\": \"https://example.com\"}' \\\n    \"https://${GITEA_HOST}/api/v1/repos/${OWNER}/${REPOSITORY}/statuses/${sha}\"\n\n  # create pr\n  index=$(curl -vX POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -u \"$USERNAME:$PASSWORD\" \\\n    -d \"{\\\"head\\\": \\\"$TEST_BRANCH\\\", \\\"base\\\": \\\"main\\\", \\\"title\\\": \\\"Test PR\\\", \\\"body\\\": \\\"This is a test PR.\\\"}\" \\\n    \"https://${GITEA_HOST}/api/v1/repos/${OWNER}/${REPOSITORY}/pulls\" | jq -r '.number')\n\n  # create auto merge\n  curl -vX POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -u \"$USERNAME:$PASSWORD\" \\\n    -d '{\"do\": \"merge\", \"merge_when_checks_succeed\": true}' \\\n    \"https://${GITEA_HOST}/api/v1/repos/${OWNER}/${REPOSITORY}/pulls/${index}/merge\"\n}\n\n\nautomerge\n\n```\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.24\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nNo\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86fb8e01-af76-45e4-b6dc-04c71c6d22ca)\n\n### Git Version\n\n1.24.2\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nOfficial Gitea Helm Chart with Kubernetes + Valkey.\n\n### Database\n\nPostgreSQL","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34988/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
