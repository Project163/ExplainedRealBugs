I propose we start sorting by relevance (i.e., by `_score`). \r\n\r\nThis will be needed by #32096 (I've noticed this while coding it), as GitHub's search considers matches in filenames more relevant than those in content. Moreover, Sorting by relevance seems more sensible than sorting by the `repo_id`.\r\n\r\nIf you guys are ok with it, I'll open a PR.\r\n\r\nP.S. It was hard to decide if this was a bug or a feature. In the end, I went with the latter since the code search does work.\r\n\r\nP.S. Both [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/sort-search-results.html) and [Bleve](https://blevesearch.com/docs/Sorting/) allow sorting by relevance.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32129/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"bsofiato","id":5076967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzY5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5076967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato","html_url":"https://github.com/bsofiato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-27T21:20:55Z","updated_at":"2024-09-27T21:20:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32134","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32134/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32134/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32134/events","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/32134","id":2548729404,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBFIx2858sntD","number":32134,"title":"Change the code search to sort results by relevance","user":{"login":"bsofiato","id":5076967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzY5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5076967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato","html_url":"https://github.com/bsofiato","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsofiato/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":472744940,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0NzI3NDQ5NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/labels/type/enhancement","name":"type/enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":"An improvement of existing functionality"},{"id":475283668,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0NzUyODM2Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/labels/lgtm/done","name":"lgtm/done","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"This PR has enough approvals to get merged.

This requires Gitea to recreate the code search indexes (I do not know if this is a breaking change, but I feel it deserves a heads-up).\r\n\r\nI've used [this approach](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/analysis-pathhierarchy-tokenizer.html) to model the filename index. It allows us to efficiently search for both the full path and the name of a file. Bleve, however, does not support this out-of-box, so I had to code a brand new [token filter](https://blevesearch.com/docs/Token-Filters/) to generate the search terms.\r\n\r\nI also did an overhaul in the `indexer_test.go` file. It now asserts the order of the expected results (this is important since matches based on the name of a file are more relevant than those based on its content). \r\nI've added new test scenarios that deal with searching by filename. They use a new repo included in the Gitea fixture. \r\n\r\nThe screenshot below depicts how Gitea shows the search results. It shows results based on content in the same way as the current version does. In matches based on the filename, the first seven lines of the file contents are shown (BTW, this is how GitHub does it).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d938d86-1a8d-4f89-8644-1921a473e858)\r\n\r\nResolves
