I followed the documentation at https://docs.gitea.com/administration/adding-legal-pages\r\n\r\nToday, after the update to 1.21.2, I noticed that the pages are not working anymore. I get a 404 error in the browser console and there is only a white page. The HTML files are still in the correct directory. I placed another (new) file there and it also did not work.\r\n\r\nI don't know since which version this does not work anymore, maybe one of the last updates did this, not the current one.\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.21.2\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nNo\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n2.43.0\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu 18.04.6 LTS x64\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nInstalled as a package and running as a systemd service with https://gitlab.com/packaging/gitea\n\n### Database\n\nMySQL/MariaDB","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28463/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
