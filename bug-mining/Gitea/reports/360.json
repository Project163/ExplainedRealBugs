Description\n\nWhen viewing the revision history of wiki pages, the pagination links are broken: instead of `org/repo/wiki/Page?action=_revision&page=2`, the link is only `org/repo/wiki/Page?page=2`, thus bringing the user back to the wiki page.\r\n\r\nIt looks like `$paginationParams` is not correctly set in the `base/paginate` template in this specific case, I do not know why.\r\n\r\nExample:
