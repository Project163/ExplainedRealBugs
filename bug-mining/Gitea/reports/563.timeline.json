Updating the default branch seems to have fixed the 500 on the activity tab. Default was \"main\", existing branch is \"dev\", and local default in Git is \"master\". I suppose it raises a question of choice and consistency. Oh well. Hopefully #34096 managed to address it successfully for when it's inconsistent.

The repository itube meanwhile (which has not had this web UI change made yet), does not have a selected branch.\n\nI wonder if there are any Git commands that can reliably return this branch name, and how that would be affected if multiple branches (of which none are master/main) are defined. ~~Not to mention that not all back-ends are filesystem per se (notably database services)...~~\nIt would appear that on my SQLite back-end, this only applies to `data/gitea.db`. Not sure how that applies to other back-ends, but would it be reasonable to assume repository data to be present as filesystem structures on all of them?\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/557dc45e-2825-4761-8246-292db177f003)\n\nAs far as suitable Git commands go, `git checkout --guess` struck me as interesting. However, it seems to be unable to guess the correct branch when none are already selected. Meanwhile in terms of running potentially harmful commands against the on-server repository, I decided to use rsync to grab a local copy of what's on server. While inconclusive, I'll include my findings for reference. The `git branch -l` command may be suitable-ish, but I don't like the * on selected branch, and leading space(s) regardless. And it may have multiple branches, only separated by newlines... What are we supposed to do with those?\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adcb9b92-5b59-4dde-b335-38e022309140)\n\nCome to think of it, isn't there already code in Gitea that determines a list of possible branches? That would be what I looked at in the listing for selecting a suitable default branch. That code probably \"knew\" that neither main nor master are in the default branches, on account of only listing dev. In single branch scenarios, that being implied default would be a reasonable assumption to make. Meanwhile in multiple branch scenarios, I guess it would be worth asking the user before setting the selected default branch in Git? Especially considering that such a use case would be even more niche than creating repositories from scratch with custom branch names already
