When I tried to make a new repo with a minimal test, I was unable to reproduce this issue but it is consistently the case for my existing repos. I slowly built up that minimal example until it was essentially the same as my existing job and it still returned the correct result. I've ran this instance for a while and so those existing repos were created in earlier gitea versions and that's the only thing I can think of that would make them different than a new repo. Any idea on what could cause this behavior and if there is something specific I need to look for and correct in the database maybe for those repos migrated from earlier versions?\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.21.0-rc1\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nNo\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n2.40\n\n### Operating System\n\nalpine:latest\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nself-built in a docker container\n\n### Database\n\nSQLite","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/27678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/27678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
