This issue is about an inconsistency in the colouring of commits signed with a GPG master key versus a GPG subkey.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: Have two verified GPG keys for the user. One with a master key and another with a subkey. Have git set up with a username that is _not_ matching the username in Gitea.\r\n\r\nWhen a commit is signed with a **GPG subkey** the **color is grey** and the hover text states \"No known key found for this signature in the database\". See attached screenshot marked with 1.\r\n\r\nWhen the commit is signed with a **GPG master key** the **color is orange** and the hover text reads \"Signed by untrusted user who does not match committer: ...\". See attached screenshot marked with 2.\r\n\r\nI would expect the color to have been orange for both these cases.\r\n\r\nAdditional info:\r\n- When the username signing the commit matches the Gitea user, then the signed commit is coloured green regardless of whether a GPG master key or a GPG subkey signed the commit. This is expected.\r\n- You must run a recent Gitea to be able to verify a GPG subkey, cf.
