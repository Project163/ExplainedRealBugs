sharing my thoughts here.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is not as hard as it seems, as in the branches view, we already have logic that tells whether a branch is worth a PR for the base branch. We can transplant this logic from to `forked repo branch` to the `base default branch`. So we always catch the right branches to show.\r\n\r\nSimply put, the behavior should be:\r\n* target's commit to the branch is fresh (less than 2 hours)\r\n* Then do a `GetUpstreamDivergingInfo` for the `ahead` counter\r\n    * if any `ahead` to the base branch is greater than 0, include them\r\n* the rest follow the current `prepareRecentlyPushedNewBranches` filter logic\r\n\r\nCould this be the

Results in some scenarios, the `Sync fork` button is not shown as expected.\r\n\r\nI would like to work on this issue, and the following is my fix design:\r\n\r\n* By reference to `modules/git/repo_compare.go`'s `GetCompareInfo`, implement a temporary remote for the forked branch to make the `git rev-list` work.\r\n* The `rev-list` for the forked branch and base branch is much alike a pull request without listing the file changes but getting the summary of the commit change.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to #32769, if this is fixed, the improved `GetDivergingCommits` could help the other issue.\r\n\r\n### Gitea Version\r\n\r\n34dfc25\r\n\r\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Log Gist\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n![Snipaste_2025-01-08_12-08-30](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16f3445b-51d8-4c6f-89b2-e6ac2f573625)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Git Version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### How are you running Gitea?\r\n\r\ndev container from ubuntu22.04\r\n\r\n### Database\r\n\r\nSQLite","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33145/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33145/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"changchaishi","id":25934612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTM0NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25934612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi","html_url":"https://github.com/changchaishi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-11T08:08:55Z","updated_at":"2025-01-11T08:08:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33215","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33215/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33215/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33215/events","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/33215","id":2781693080,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBFIx286Haghl","number":33215,"title":"Fix push message behavior","user":{"login":"changchaishi","id":25934612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTM0NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25934612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi","html_url":"https://github.com/changchaishi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/changchaishi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":472744938,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0NzI3NDQ5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/labels/type/bug","name":"type/bug","color":"ee0701","default":false,"description":""},{"id":475283668,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0NzUyODM2Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/labels/lgtm/done","name":"lgtm/done","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"This PR has enough approvals to get merged.
