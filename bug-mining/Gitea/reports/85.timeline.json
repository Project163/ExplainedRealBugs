all I did was to remove the outer closure (and one level of indentation) ~and removed the HTTP method and pattern checks as they seem redundant because go-chi already does those checks~. You might want to check \"Hide whitespace\" when reviewing it.\r\n\r\nAlternative solution (a bit simpler): append `, misc.DummyOK` to the route declarations that utilize `storageHandler()` - this makes it return an empty response when the URL is invalid. I've tested this one and it works too.

all I did was to remove the outer closure (and one level of indentation) ~and removed the HTTP method and pattern checks as they seem redundant because go-chi already does those checks~.
