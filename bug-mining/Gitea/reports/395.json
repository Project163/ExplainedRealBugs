Thus I thought of using email address of the user from project management tool and making a prior request to gitea to get the user's username then use that to populate the `assignee` field for PR generation request. (Also I'd expect PR generate endpoint to accept email address or username but anyway) I couldn't manage to get the user info of a user by querying their email address. Getting all users to iterate over is too slow, not because of iteration but getting all users endpoint response.\r\n\r\nAny plan to make the `/user/search` endpoint allow us to search by email address?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"techknowlogick","id":164197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDE5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick","html_url":"https://github.com/techknowlogick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/30898/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/30898/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
