Do you need something more for reproducing this issue or debugging output? Just let me know\n\nIs the cronjob enabled by default? Or could you manually trigger it on the UI?\n\n----\n\nQuote:\n\n> ps: I am not familiar with the gc_lfs code so have no idea at the moment, sorry\n\nSorry I'm not quite familiar with lfs module ..... so could only guess.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2620469228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2621069842","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31113#issuecomment-2621069842","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31113","id":2621069842,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx286cOloS","user":{"login":"Danstiv","id":50794055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzk0MDU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50794055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danstiv","html_url":"https://github.com/Danstiv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danstiv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danstiv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danstiv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danstiv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danstiv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danstiv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danstiv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danstiv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Danstiv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-29T09:11:34Z","updated_at":"2025-01-29T09:11:34Z","body":"Perhaps
