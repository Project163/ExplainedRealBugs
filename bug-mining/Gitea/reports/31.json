This mostly works.\r\n\r\nWhen an Agit-submitted PR is closed, and then the \"Reopen\" button is pressed, the server responds with a 500 internal server error.\r\n\r\nIdeally it would not return a 500 error; it would either reopen the PR, or (more likely) provide a clear error message about the temporary branch being deleted (or whatever).\r\n\r\nI included a log from our production instance from when we first noticed this problem.  It's quite short.\r\n\r\n#### Reproducer\r\n\r\nFirst, make a git repo.  I called mine \"test\".
