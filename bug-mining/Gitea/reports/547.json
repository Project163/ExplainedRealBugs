Feature Description\n\nMy idea is to\n- [x] add a Ephemeral field to the database structure of the Runner\n- [x] when the Ephemeral field is true let FetchTask return no task without error if the assigned task is in progress\n- [x] when the Ephemeral field is true let FetchTask return no task with an error if the assigned task is in done, and remove the runner from the database.\n- [x] UpdateTask and UpdateLog scope access to runnerid\n- [x] Update the runnerv1 protocol to have an Ephemeral field as well during registration\n- [x] Update act_runner to have the ephemeral flag, which implies run-once \n\nThis proposal would allow to securely deploy a registred host-mode act_runner in a VM and reset the same after job exit.\n\nSome of my idea has been scetched in https://github.com/ChristopherHX/gitea/tree/ephemeral-runners.\n\nProtocol proposal here: https://gitea.com/gitea/actions-proto-def/pulls/14\n\nRead more here:
