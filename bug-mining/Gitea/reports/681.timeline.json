This caused SPM to fail with keyNotFound error when fetching package metadata.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Add 'name' field to Person struct (inherited from https://schema.org/Thing)\r\n- Populate 'name' field in API response using existing String() method\r\n- Maintains backward compatibility with existing schema.org fields\r\n- Provides both formats for maximum compatibility\r\n\r\nThe fix ensures

This caused SPM to fail with keyNotFound error when fetching package metadata.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Add 'name' field to Person struct (inherited from https://schema.org/Thing)\r\n- Populate 'name' field in API response using existing String() method\r\n- Maintains backward compatibility with existing schema.org fields\r\n- Provides both formats for maximum compatibility\r\n\r\nThe fix ensures
