As far as I understand, Gitea is executing actions code from a PR, and not from `main`, but this must be another issue.\r\n\r\nHere is the following bug.\r\nIf branch protection is set for branch `*` all pushes to new branches will fail with \"`Gitea: Internal Server Error (no message for end users)`\"\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n1. Create a branch protection for branch `*`, set protected files to `.gitea/**;mkdocs.yml;mkdocs.yaml`, push - `Enable Push`\r\n2. clone repo via ssh, and do:\r\n```\r\n$ git branch pr-test\r\n$ git checkout pr-test\r\nSwitched to branch 'pr-test'\r\n$ touch text.txt\r\n$ git add text.txt \r\n$ git commit -m 'test add file'\r\n[pr-test 665f1b8] test add file\r\n 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)\r\n create mode 100644 text.txt\r\n$ git push origin pr-test\r\nEnumerating objects: 3, done.\r\nCounting objects: 100% (3/3), done.\r\nDelta compression using up to 16 threads\r\nCompressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.\r\nWriting objects: 100% (2/2), 257 bytes | 257.00 KiB/s, done.\r\nTotal 2 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\r\nremote: \r\nremote: Gitea: Internal Server Error (no message for end users)\r\nTo demo.gitea.com:f403/GetAffectedFiles-test.git\r\n !
