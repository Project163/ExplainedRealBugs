#28853 \r\n\r\nNeeds both https://gitea.com/gitea/act_runner/pulls/473 and https://gitea.com/gitea/act_runner/pulls/471 on the runner side and patched `actions/upload-artifact@v4` / `actions/download-artifact@v4`, like `christopherhx/gitea-upload-artifact@v4` and `christopherhx/gitea-download-artifact@v4`, to not return errors due to GHES not beeing supported yet.\r\n\r\n---\r\nKnown issues\r\n\r\n- official action v4 doesn't allow replace, this is not checked\r\n  - to check this, we need to know if the artifact has been created in the current run_attempt of the job\r\n- added fixture uses some invalid task token data, which are not used by the test and required by constraints\r\n  - I'm not shure how to generate these fields for a fixture\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen Questions\r\n\r\n- Can we Append Blockstorage?\r\n  - merging chunks like now is inefficient\r\n  - use the url of the backend to upload via a signed url?\r\n  - GitHub returns the azure Blockstorage url for direct upload without any proxy like used in this PR\r\n\r\nWorkflow used for testing purposes\r\n```yaml\r\non:\r\n  push:\r\njobs:\r\n  _5:\r\n    runs-on:
