If that, it means this repository hasn't been synced.\r\n\r\nThe reason caused that is after user upgrade from v1.20 -> v1.21, he just push branches without visit the repository user interface. Because all repositories routers will check whether a branches sync is necessary but push has not such check.\r\n\r\nFor every repository, it has two states, synced or not synced. If there is zero branch for a repository, then it will be assumed as non-sync state. Otherwise, it's synced state. So if we think it's synced, we just need to update branch/insert new branch. Otherwise do a full sync. So that, for every push, there will be almost no extra load added. It's high performance than yours.\r\n\r\nFor the implementation, we in fact will try to update the branch first, if updated success with affect records > 0, then all are done. Because that means the branch has been in the database. If no record is affected, that means the branch does not exist in database. So there are two possibilities. One is this is a new branch, then we just need to insert the record. Another is the branches haven't been synced, then we need to sync all the branches into database.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28361/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11200601501,"node_id":"CE_lADOBFIx2852zcrDzwAAAAKbm52d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/11200601501","actor":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-09T13:30:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11200601543,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBFIx2852zcrDzwAAAAKbm53H","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/11200601543","actor":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"aeb383025f90abcda7a9562684376b1996dcf3a5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/commits/aeb383025f90abcda7a9562684376b1996dcf3a5","created_at":"2023-12-09T13:30:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11200815349,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBFIx2852zcrDzwAAAAKbnuD1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/11200815349","actor":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e4f5b9c56f427af9dd1720a5e0a048254ebbf77a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lunny/gitea/commits/e4f5b9c56f427af9dd1720a5e0a048254ebbf77a","created_at":"2023-12-09T15:51:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_ad

If that, it means this repository hasn't been synced.\r\n\r\nThe reason caused that is after user upgrade from v1.20 -> v1.21, he just push branches without visit the repository user interface. Because all repositories routers will check whether a branches sync is necessary but push has not such check.\r\n\r\nFor every repository, it has two states, synced or not synced. If there is zero branch for a repository, then it will be assumed as non-sync state. Otherwise, it's synced state. So if we think it's synced, we just need to update branch/insert new branch. Otherwise do a full sync. So that, for every push, there will be almost no extra load added. It's high performance than yours.\r\n\r\nFor the implementation, we in fact will try to update the branch first, if updated success with affect records > 0, then all are done. Because that means the branch has been in the database. If no record is affected, that means the branch does not exist in database. So there are two possibilities. One is this is a new branch, then we just need to insert the record. Another is the branches haven't been synced, then we need to sync all the branches into database.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11205784833,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBFIx2852zcrDzwAAAAKb6rUB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/11205784833","actor":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"87db4a47c8e22b7c2e4f2b9f9efc8df1e3622884","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/commits/87db4a47c8e22b7c2e4f2b9f9efc8df1e3622884","created_at":"2023-12-11T06:16:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/1880545705","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28056#issuecomment-1880545705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28056","id":1880545705,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx285wFtmp","user":{"login":"dongfo","id":8027556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjc1NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8027556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfo","html_url":"https://github.com/dongfo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongfo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-08T08:15:49Z","updated_at":"2024-01-08T08:15:49Z","body":"how
