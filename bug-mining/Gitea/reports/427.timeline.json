When this happens, finally submitting (i.e. when the textarea is non-empty) will call all submit handler instances, incrementing the review comment counter by a lot. This is all UI so reloading the page will get the correct value from database.\r\n\r\n### Fix 1\r\n\r\nUse a flag when attaching the handler, only attach if the flag is unset.\r\n\r\n### Issue 2\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the form is currently submitted on the button click, without validating the form on frontend (i.e. we manually call the form submit within the click handler, but the HTML will not allow the form to submit if the textarea is empty). \r\n\r\nI'd like to point out that if we can disable the button whilst the textarea is empty, we don't have to do any validation here (as the button cannot be clicked anyway until the form can officially be submitted).\r\n\r\n### Fix 2\r\n\r\nPrevent default behaviour in this handler if the textarea is empty.\r\n\r\n### Issue 3\r\n\r\nWe were not handling form submission on CTRL+Enter, only on button click.\r\n\r\n### Fix 3\r\n\r\nAdded explicit handler for keydown event to check CTRL+Enter and submit form to increment the counter.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31641/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-21T12:26:16Z","updated_at":"2024-11-21T12:26:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32596","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32596/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32596/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32596/events","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/32596","id":2679288540,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBFIx286CqSUl","number":32596,"title":"Fix PR diff review form submit","user":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":475283668,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0NzUyODM2Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/labels/lgtm/done","name":"lgtm/done","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"This PR has enough approvals to get merged.
