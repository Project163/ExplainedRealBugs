https://forum.gitea.com/t/large-actions-artifacts-8mb-will-fail-checksum-when-merging-their-chunks/9291\r\n\r\nI'm using a self-hosted Gitea 1.22.0, with the patched version of `upload-artifact@v4` (https://github.com/ChristopherHX/gitea-upload-artifact@v4), and am trying to upload a ~1.8GB artifact.\r\n\r\nFrom the Actions step:\r\n```\r\nUploaded bytes 1851809172\r\nFinished uploading artifact content to blob storage!\r\nSHA256 hash of uploaded artifact zip is 5445b7ac4b993cbc01f349b0ec90b8ebceee564cff62ce9a529fdb9ce1326886\r\nFinalizing artifact upload\r\n::error::Failed to FinalizeArtifact: Unexpected token 'E', \"Error merge chunks%0A\" is not valid JSON\r\n```\r\nWhen looking at the Gitea server logs, this matches up to this error message:\r\n\r\n`...artifactsv4.go:363:finalizeArtifact() [E] Error merge chunks: update artifact error checksum is invalid`\r\n\r\nI did some tests, and it looks like any artifacts that are bigger than roughly 8MB will fail to be merged when finalizing the upload.","closed_by":{"login":"lafriks","id":165205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTIwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/165205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks","html_url":"https://github.com/lafriks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafriks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31354/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":3},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31354/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
