Unfortunately there was no documentation of what that string value should be to set the appropriate permissions.\r\nAfter digging deep into the [code](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/b270b30aebf42fb45d9a57288cf3dcbfa842a760/models/perm/access_mode.go#L46) I found that the permission can be one of three values. \r\n\r\nIMHO this should be documented in the Swagger documentation of the REST Api.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![grafik](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/assets/35454706/94f77718-a4e4-4871-a9f6-62ec07be0950)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"wolfogre","id":9418365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MTgzNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9418365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre","html_url":"https://github.com/wolfogre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wolfogre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31552/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31552/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
