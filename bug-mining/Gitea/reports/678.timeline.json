y":"I’ve submitted PR #35151 along with some explanations and have another one after that merged.\n\nAs @wxiaoguang mentioned at https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/32018#issuecomment-2594560477, config.lock files appear when Git subprocess exits abnormally while executing `git config` or `git remote` commands. This can happen, for example, if the Gitea instance restarts while a Git subprocess is still running.\n\nCould you confirm whether the timestamps of these lock files correspond to the times when Gitea was restarted?\n\nAfter PR #35151, we could follow up with another PR to automatically remove `config.lock` files, since a global lock is already in place before any operations on the config file.\n\nFor now, the workaround is to delete these files
