When a notification comes in, ALL of my browser tabs, open to the gitea instance in question, properly update the notification bell. However, once you read the notifications the other tabs **do not** update even after waiting hours.\r\n\r\nThis is extremely confusing as one typically has several gitea tabs open at once and some will say 0 notifications while the others are in some mixed state of having a badge that says 1, 2, or 5 unread notifications etc.\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.21.2+426-g13e26f04b\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\nTab 1\r\n![notif-0unread](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/assets/7989986/6e56ffef-8451-4f67-bc59-caed621c288c)\r\n\r\nTab 2..n\r\n![notif-1unread_allothertabs](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/assets/7989986/70dab562-8070-4973-b454-89a19b735752)\r\n\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nOwn build - https://projects.blender.org/\n\n### Database\n\nSQLite","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/29065/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/29065/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
