Previously, in version 1.20.5, this functionality was operating as expected. However, since the update to 1.21.2, the feature appears to be non-functional.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce this issue on a test repository: https://try.gitea.io/loncardom/test/wiki/Home.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to two questions:\r\n\r\n1. Was this capability in Wiki pages an unintended feature in 1.20.5?\r\n2. Is this change in functionality from version 1.20.5 to 1.21.2 a bug, or was it an intentional removal of the feature?\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that the [official documentation](https://docs.gitea.com/usage/automatically-linked-references#issues-and-pull-requests) does not explicitly mention Wiki pages in the context of automatic linking, yet this feature was operational in the earlier version (1.20.5).\r\n\r\nGitea is awesome btw.\r\nThanks\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.21.2\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nRunning Gitea through docker, though this issue is reproducible on try.gitea.io\n\n### Database\n\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
