Description\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading from 1.20.5 to 1.21.2 the CI pipeline status checks were ignored in PRs.\r\n\r\nI checked the release notes before updating the instance [here](https://blog.gitea.com/release-of-1.21.0#breaking-changes), however nothing mentioned this change.\r\n\r\nAfter investigating the database i found out, that when a repo had status checks enabled but no custom pattern was supplied it skipped the check.\r\n\r\nWhen i updated the field `status_check_contexts` to `[*]` status checks worked again.\r\n\r\nQuery used to find \"broken\" branch status check entries:\r\n```sql\r\nselect\r\n    protected_branch.status_check_contexts,\r\n    repository.id\r\nfrom repository\r\n     join protected_branch\r\n       on protected_branch.repo_id = repository.id\r\nwhere protected_branch.enable_status_check\r\n      and ( protected_branch.status_check_contexts is null\r\n            or protected_branch.status_check_contexts = 'null' )\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Gitea Version\r\n\r\n1.21.2\r\n\r\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Log
