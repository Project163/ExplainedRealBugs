Therefore, these jobs will not run until the required jobs are completed.\r\n\r\n### Rerun a single job\r\nWhen a single job is rerun, its dependents should also be rerun, just like GitHub does (https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28761#issuecomment-2008620820). In this case, only the specified job will be set to `waiting`, its dependents will be set to `blocked` to wait the job.\r\n\r\n### Show warning if every job has `needs`\r\nIf every job in a workflow has `needs`, all jobs will be blocked and no job can be run. So I add a warning message.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/assets/15528715/88f43511-2360-465d-be96-ee92b57ff67b\" width=\"480px\"
