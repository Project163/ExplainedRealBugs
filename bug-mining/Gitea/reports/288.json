But when Gitea is installed with ADAPTER/PROVIDER set to redis-cluster, it is instead configuring it to memory. \r\n\r\nOn analysis of code, it seems string \"redis-cluster\" is not supported for ADAPTER/PROVIDER. \r\n\r\nCache :\r\nhttps://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/58b204b813cd3a97db904d889d552e64a7e398ff/modules/setting/cache.go#L53\r\n\r\nSession:\r\nhttps://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/58b204b813cd3a97db904d889d552e64a7e398ff/modules/setting/session.go#L44\r\nhttps://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/58b204b813cd3a97db904d889d552e64a7e398ff/modules/setting/session.go#L45\r\n\r\nDocumentation Reference\r\nCache - https://docs.gitea.com/1.20/administration/config-cheat-sheet#cache-cache\r\nSession - https://docs.gitea.com/1.20/administration/config-cheat-sheet#session-session\r\n\r\nWhen it is set to \"redis\" both cache/session seems to be working fine even for redis cluster instances.\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.21.7\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n\r\nWhen redis-cluster is used for ADAPTER/SESSION \r\n![tempsnip2](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/assets/17761038/2cd7e0bd-c02c-4eb1-99c2-e98f17afa9f7)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen using redis as ADAPTER\r\n![tempsnip](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/assets/17761038/5f9daf7a-468e-4632-b422-df4297ba7c1d)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nGitea installed in a K8s environment with charts taken from https://dl.gitea.com/charts/\n\n### Database\n\nPostgreSQL","closed_by":{"login":"techknowlogick","id":164197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDE5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick","html_url":"https://github.com/techknowlogick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/30534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/30534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
