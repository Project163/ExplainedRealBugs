However, the `Response` or anywhere else (except log on server) doesn't describe the reason, and may make user think that the webhook server is crashed.\r\nIt would be great if a friendly notice was shown in `Response column`.\r\nsee PR #26814\n\n### Screenshots\n\n## Current behavior\r\n![Current page when webhook is inactivate, showing empty Response Headers and Response Body](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/assets/51789698/66baec35-fd4f-4bd5-8152-cf469113a62e)\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n![Page displayed after this PR, Response Body is set](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/assets/51789698/1f42dbd1-649b-41a7-a13f-de13a5dfca1b)","closed_by":{"login":"silverwind","id":115237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind","html_url":"https://github.com/silverwind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
