In my case, this mean `SKIP_TLS_VERIFY` does nothing when running `dump_repo`.\n\nAdding `setting.LoadSettings()` somewhere in `runDumpRepository` would fix the issue, but I'm not sure if it would have unwanted side effects.\n\nEdit: Specifically, I'm using `./gitea dump-repo` on the [cli](https://docs.gitea.com/administration/command-line#dump-repo).\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"techknowlogick","id":164197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDE5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick","html_url":"https://github.com/techknowlogick","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/techknowlogick/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34465/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
