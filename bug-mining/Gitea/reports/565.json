(replacing `src` in link with `raw`)\n\nWhat I cannot get working is relative links  _to_ raw.\n- `[config example](raw/config.example)` -> HTTP 404:  \n  (turns into https://gitea.local/$USER/$REPO/src/branch/main/raw/config.example`, i.e. \"raw\" is interpreted as a relative folder (which is the only sensible thing to do)\n- `[config example](/raw/config.example)` (leading slash) turns into `gitea.local/raw/config.example` (i.e. makes it an absolute link from base-url. Again this is the sensible, HTTP-spec-conforming thing to do.\n- appending `?raw=1` (the way github solves it, [according to stackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417387/how-can-i-create-relative-links-from-my-markdown-to-github-raw-files?rq=3)) -> opens the normal, non-raw view.\n\n\nIs there any way to tell the link-rewriter to use 'raw' instead of 'src'?\nIf so: where did I overlook the documentation?\nIf not: can we add something (preferably a redirect if `&raw=1` is present, for github compatibility, though alternatives welcome)\n\nSide note: I run into exactly the same problem in GitLab, where GL uses `/-/blob/` where gitea has `/src/`, and GL:`/-/raw/` for gitea:`/raw/`.\nGitLab also doesn't handle `?raw=1`.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
