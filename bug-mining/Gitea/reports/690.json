Configure a pipeline job with webhook:\n   - Trigger On: Push Event  \n   - Branch filter: `refs/heads/main`  \n2. Create (or delete) a tag in Gitea.  \n3. Observe that the pipeline is triggered anyway (because `ref` contains `refs/tags/...`, but the event type is still `push`).\n\n### Proposal  \n- Add differentiation in webhook logic: a tag operation should optionally trigger only the `create` or `delete` webhook.\n- Or at minimum, support an optional configuration to exclude push events whose `ref` starts with `refs/tags/`.\n\nThis change would prevent branch-only pipelines from being inadvertently triggered by tag-related actions.\n\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.22.2\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n2.49.0\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nWindows Service\n\n### Database\n\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"silverwind","id":115237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind","html_url":"https://github.com/silverwind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35449/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
