When Gitea must fallback to the legacy `_links` field a logline is emitted at INFO level which looks like this:\r\n```\r\n...s/lfs/http_client.go:188:performOperation() [I] <LFSPointer ee95d0a27ccdfc7c12516d4f80dcf144a5eaf10d0461d282a7206390635cdbee:160> is using a deprecated batch schema response!\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've only run `test-backend` with this code, but added a new test to cover this case. Additionally I have a fork with this change deployed which I've confirmed syncs LFS from Gitea<-Artifactory (which has legacy `_links`) as well as from Gitea<-Gitea (which has the modern `actions`).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31513/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31513/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13328192778,"node_id":"MIE_lADOBFIx286Nz8bBzwAAAAMabBUK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/13328192778","actor":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-28T08:11:18Z","milestone":{"title":"1.23.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13328550016,"node_id":"CE_lADOBFIx286Nz8bBzwAAAAMacYiA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/13328550016","actor":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-28T08:42:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13328550048,"node_id":"CE_lADOBFIx286Nz8bBzwAAAAMacYig","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/13328550048","actor":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"df805d6ed0458dbec258d115238fde794ed4d0ce","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/commits/df805d6ed0458dbec258d115238fde794ed4d0ce","created_at":"2024-06-28T08:42:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13328691596,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBFIx286Nz8bBzwAAAAMac7GM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/13328691596","actor":{"login":"hi-noikiy","id":32630320,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjMwMzIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32630320?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-noikiy","html_url":"https://github.com/hi-noikiy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-noikiy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-noikiy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-noikiy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-noikiy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-noikiy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-noikiy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-noikiy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hi-noikiy/events{/privacy}","re
