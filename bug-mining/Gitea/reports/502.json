I followed the instructions to add the repo to an arm64 machine running debian trixie (testing), but it reports an error:\n\n```console\n$ sudo apt update\nGet:1 http://http.us.debian.org/debian trixie InRelease [175 kB]\nGet:2 http://http.us.debian.org/debian trixie/main Sources [10.3 MB]                    \nGet:3 https://demo.gitea.com/api/packages/infinoid/debian kernel InRelease [2,010 B]    \nErr:3 https://demo.gitea.com/api/packages/infinoid/debian kernel InRelease              \n  Sub-process /usr/bin/sqv returned an error code (1), error message is: Error: Malformed Message: Malformed OpenPGP message\nGet:4 http://http.us.debian.org/debian trixie/main arm64 Packages [9,340 kB]\nGet:5 http://http.us.debian.org/debian trixie/main Translation-en [6,308 kB]\nWarning: GPG error: https://demo.gitea.com/api/packages/infinoid/debian kernel InRelease: Sub-process /usr/bin/sqv returned an error code (1), error message is: Error: Malformed Message: Malformed OpenPGP message\nError: The repository 'https://demo.gitea.com/api/packages/infinoid/debian kernel InRelease' is not signed.\nNotice: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.\nNotice: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.\n```\n\nThis is not arm64-specific, it happens on x86-64 too.  That just happens to be where I first saw the issue.\n\nApt recently switched to a new implementation of PGP, called Sequoia, for signature verification.  It's written in rust and has stricter parsing.  This is in the apt v2.9.19 changelog:\n\n>   * Replace GnuPG with Sequoia on supported Debian platforms\n>     - methods: Add new sqv method\n>     - debian: Add default policy to allow SHA-1 self-signatures until 2026\n>     - debian: Plug sqv into the package build\n\nDebian has packaged several of Sequoia's command line tools, including `sqv` and `sq`.  `sq` looks useful for getting more info from the parsing process.  Here's what it thinks of gitea's generated signatures, and a main Debian mirror:\n\n```console\n$ curl -s https://demo.gitea.com/api/packages/infinoid/debian/dists/kernel/InRelease | sq packet dump\nUnknown or Unsupported Packet, new CTB, 284 bytes\n    Tag: Signature Packet\n    Error: Malformed MPI: leading bit is not set: expected bit 8 to be set in  1011001 (59)\n  \n$ curl -s http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/trixie/InRelease | sq packet dump\nSignature Packet, old CTB, 563 bytes\n    Version: 4\n    Type: Text\n    Pk algo: RSA\n    Hash algo: SHA256\n    Hashed area:\n      Issuer Fingerprint: A7236886F3CCCAAD148A27F80E98404D386FA1D9\n      Signature creation time: 2025-01-25 20:24:46 UTC\n    Unhashed area:\n      Issuer: 0E98404D386FA1D9\n    Digest prefix: 2771\n    Level: 0 (signature over data)\n  \nSignature Packet, old CTB, 563 bytes\n    Version: 4\n    Type: Text\n    Pk algo: RSA\n    Hash algo: SHA256\n    Hashed area:\n      Issuer Fingerprint: 4CB50190207B4758A3F73A796ED0E7B82643E131\n      Signature creation time: 2025-01-25 20:24:48 UTC\n    Unhashed area:\n      Issuer: 6ED0E7B82643E131\n    Digest prefix: A44F\n    Level: 0 (signature over data)\n  \n$ \n```\n\n(For reference, the files retrieved by `curl` are in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Infinoid/7008c98c29c470e631e218b66fcf41d4).)\n\nDebian testing (trixie) and unstable (sid) both include this change, and are unable to retrieve package lists from gitea.
