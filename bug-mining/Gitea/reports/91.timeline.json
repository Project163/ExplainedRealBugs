原因是下面的函数\r\n\r\nfunc updateRepoIndexer(ctx context.Context, repoID int64) error {\r\n\tids, err := issue_model.GetIssueIDsByRepoID(ctx, repoID)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn

行，如下\r\n\r\n\tcase <-time.After(pushBlockTime):\r\n\t\treturn context.DeadlineExceeded\r\n\t\t\r\n出错原因是 queue 满了， 要命的是 updateRepoIndexer() 会不停的被重新调用，不停地出错。\r\n\r\n解决方法是配置中添加下面的行就好了， 只要确保 queue length

root problem is that indexing all issues of a repository could be a big task, and it could cause a blocking. So we use a queue to cache the task. But what if the queue was full? I noticed this case and added the warning log in the last refactoring to help users know this (the old code just ignore it):\r\n\r\n```\r\n[W] It seems that issue indexer is slow and the queue is full. Please check the issue indexer or increase the queue size.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the best solution is increasing the size of queue (just like the log said).\r\n\r\n@mei-rune Thanks for your advice. I have indeed found some logic that could be improved. I will submit a patch later.
