Because of this, it looks like this maybe a problem with the frontend.\r\n\r\nI also decided to checkout 21331be30cb8f6c2d8b9dd99f1061623900632b9 (when the contributors graph was introduced) and rebuilt my dev environment. Weirdly enough I still have the same problem, so I'm not sure what's going on (maybe some direct/transitive dependency causing this break?). \n\n### Gitea Version\n\n53b55223d167c3fc996dd0278a656f421408ace7\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\ngit version 2.44.0\n\n### Operating System\n\nDebian\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nIn a Docker dev container firing up a Gitea dev environment using the `launch.json` configurations found in Gitea's VSCode docs.\r\n\r\nI did also use try.gitea.io and looked for other user repos with chart data but they seem to have the same problem.\n\n### Database\n\nSQLite","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/30851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/30851/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
