let me try to summarize the solution: suppose there is a `branch-a` in fork repo:\r\n\r\n1. if `branch-a` exists in base repo: try to sync `base:branch-a` to `fork:branch-a` \r\n2. if `branch-a` doesn't exist in base repo: try to sync `base:main` to `fork:branch-a` \r\n\r\nIs it good enough?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2591976978/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/2592002258","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33271#issuecomment-2592002258","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33271","id":2592002258,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx286aftDS","user":{"login":"tkoeferli","id":33595077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNTk1MDc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33595077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkoeferli","html_url":"https://github.com/tkoeferli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkoeferli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkoeferli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkoeferli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkoeferli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkoeferli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkoeferli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkoeferli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkoeferli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tkoeferli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-15T09:00:28Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T09:00:28Z","body":"Yes
