Building business logic over an `auto_increment` primary key like `id` is risky and there’re already plenty of discussions on the Internet.\r\n\r\nThere‘s no guarantee for `auto_increment` values to be monotonic, especially upon failures or with a cluster. In the specific case, we met the problem of commit statuses being outdated when using TiDB as the database. As [being documented](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/auto-increment), `auto_increment` values assigned to an `insert` statement will only be monotonic on a per server (node) basis.\r\n\r\nCloses
