Create a new Repo\r\n2. Create a new Release with a Tag called \"Test\"\r\n3. Clone the Repo\r\n4. Run these commands:\r\n```bash\r\ngit tag -d Test\r\ngit commit --allow-empty -m \"New Commit\"\r\ngit tag Test\r\ngit push\r\ngit push -f --tags\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you visit the Release Page, it shows \r\n\r\n> 1 commits to main since this release\r\n\r\nBut this is not true. The Tag has now changed to the latest Commit.\r\n\r\nI expect Gitea to do one of these 2 Options:\r\n1. Just Update the Release\r\n2. Do the same as if the Tag was deleted\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.20.1\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\nNot relevant to reproduce\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n2.41.0\n\n### Operating System\n\nManjaro\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nBinary downloaded from GitHub\n\n### Database\n\nSQLite","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26090/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/26090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
