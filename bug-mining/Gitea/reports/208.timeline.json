\"bug\").\r\n\r\nMaybe you misunderstand the problem. I will quote my explanations and summarize them again:\r\n\r\n1. The fact is: it is a requirement that making Gitea work with both `https://host/SUBPATH` and `https://host/SUBPATH/`, the document has said so:\r\n    * https://docs.gitea.com/administration/reverse-proxies#apache-httpd-with-a-sub-path\r\n    * `# Note: no trailing slash after either /git or port`\r\n2. Based on the fact, a URL `href=\"/SUBPATH?page=2...` should work, it doesn't need an extra slash.\r\n3. Gitea never adds extra slash to a full path\r\n    * so you only see: `https://host/SUBPATH` , `https://host/SUBPATH/user`, `https://host/SUBPATH/user/repo`\r\n    * you won't see: `https://host/SUBPATH/` , `https://host/SUBPATH/user/`, `https://host/SUBPATH/user/repo/`\r\n4. The root problem of your bug report is: \"Without the forward-slash users are told to login again (Gitea destroys the session maybe?).\"\r\n    * I think it is caused by incorrect cookie path\r\n    * After the fix (29534), I think it should have been resolved. Users won't get logout, nor they need to \"manually edit the URL\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't see why you wouldn't follow the document and why you insist to add an extra trailing slash for some links, I don't see such a real use-case for end users either.\r\n\r\nIf you think the trailing slash is a must, please show some real bad cases for no-trailing-slash. Without a real bad case, I couldn't figure out what you mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/1975012419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11988961375,"node_id":"LE_lADOBFIx286BBNivzwAAAALKmQhf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/events/11988961375","actor":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-03-03T03:59:27Z","label":{"name":"issue/needs-feedback","color":"1d76db"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/comments/1975012726","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/29533#issuecomment-1975012726","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/29533","id":1975012726,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFIx2851uE12","user":{"login":"OdinVex","id":44311901,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MzExOTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44311901?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdinVex","html_url":"https://github.com/OdinVex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdinVex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdinVex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdinVex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdinVex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdinVex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdinVex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdinVex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdinVex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OdinVex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-03T04:01:16Z","updated_at":"2024-03-03T04:02:54Z","body":"The fact Gitea uses a forward-slash to begin with is enough to follow convention.

Edit: And yes, `/SUBPATH/` is a directory, even if virtual.
