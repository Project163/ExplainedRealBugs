Description\n\n`[[file:]]` Org links are causing 500 internal server errors (similar to #17139):\r\n```\r\nAn error occurred:\r\n\r\nRender, orgmode.Render failed: could not write output: interface conversion: org.Node is org.Text, not org.RegularLink\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe culprit lies in Org `file:` links, e.g., [[GPLv3 Badge][file:https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL_3-green.svg]]. This should show a GPLv3 badge, but instead triggers the error. Although omitting the `file:` still achieves the intended result without an error, it should be noted that this works just fine on GitHub and in the previous version of Gitea, i.e., v1.21.3.\r\n\r\nP.S.
