Then, I found that the content stored using LFS (Large File Storage) was not correctly synchronized. So, I opened the trace logs to check. The batch operation was normal, but when it came to the download operation, the first server directly returned a 500 error, and no response body was returned. Therefore, I tried to understand what was happening from the source code and found that the request header for the download operation would additionally include an Accept field. When I removed it, the download worked properly...\r\n\r\nFollowed by the official [doc](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/api/basic-transfers.md), it seems there is no need to download with `Accept` header, maybe we can remove it from download?\r\n\r\nI don't have the permission to the bitbucket server, so I don't know what happend in the bitbucket background.\n\n### Gitea Version\n\nv1.22.0\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nNo\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\nlinux\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nrun from docker\n\n### Database\n\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"silverwind","id":115237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind","html_url":"https://github.com/silverwind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
