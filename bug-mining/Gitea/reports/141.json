The `/user/login` page always makes endless redirects, whereas the home (`/`) page does this as well, but from time to time (probably this is session-related or something like that).\r\n\r\nRegarding home page: it works OK usually, but if you do not use Gitea for some time (not so much, you're still logged in), it will trigger endless redirects until you open the home page again.\r\n\r\nAdditional info:\r\n\r\nGitea versions: 1.21.0, 1.21.1\r\n\r\nI'm using Gitea behind Caddy with the simplest configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncode.plashenkov.com {\r\n  tls my@email.com\r\n  reverse_proxy gitea:3000\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.21.1\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nNo\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nI'm running Gitea from Docker: `gitea/gitea:1.21.1`\n\n### Database\n\nSQLite","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/28231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
