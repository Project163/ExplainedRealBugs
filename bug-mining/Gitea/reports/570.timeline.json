Description\n\n... rendered wrong, according to my expectation, and compared to GitLab and GitHub.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the normal check-box-list syntax (which is an extension to standard Markdown):\r\n\r\n```\r\n- [x] a\r\n- [ ] b\r\n- [x] c\r\n- [ ] d\r\n```\r\n\r\nconflicts with the Reference-List syntax (which *is* standard Markdown):\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is a reference link: [x]\r\n\r\n[x]: https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is an issue, for example when using link-checkers (my case),\r\nor if one actually wants to use a reference link `[x]` (somewhat hypothetical).\r\nTo prevent this, both GitHub and GitLab support escaping the square-brackets for check-box-lists, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- \\[x\\] a\r\n- \\[ \\] b\r\n- \\[x\\] c\r\n- \\[ \\] d\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works great, as my link-checker does not pick these up as (broken) Reference-Links anymore,\r\nand the Git* sites and my local editor renders them just the same.\r\n\r\n... Gitea does not, though. It shows a greek X letter as image in the middle of the screen -\r\nI guess some sort of  math-rendering thing.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nhttps://try.gitea.io/hoijui/my-test/src/commit/05f490632b577d33fbf51e781de9d6e5e6e2718c/README.md\n\n### Gitea Version\n\nas in codeberg.org\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\n_No response_\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nthrough codeberg.org\n\n### Database\n\nNone","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/23700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/23700/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-04T12:29:02Z","updated_at":"2025-04-04T12:29:02Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34122","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34122/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34122/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34122/events","html_url":"https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/34122","id":2972238972,"node_id":"PR_kwDOBFIx286RZoVJ","number":34122,"title":"Fix markdown render behaviors","user":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":475283668,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0NzUyODM2Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/labels/lgtm/done","name":"lgtm/done","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"This PR has enough approvals to get merged.
