Description\n\nI run a single-user Gitea instance with a couple of organizations (of which I'm the only admin) that I use for \"categorizing\" my repositories.\r\n\r\nI realized today that when I transfer a repository to it the confirmation message is\r\n\r\n> This repository has been marked for transfer and awaits confirmation from \"`<org name>`\"\r\n\r\neven though there is no transfer confirmation needed (or, indeed, requested).\r\n\r\nThis message may confuse users and should only be displayed if the confirmation has been requested by the new owner(s).\n\n###
