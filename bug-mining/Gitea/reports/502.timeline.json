What happens\n\nThe `apt update` with the intel OneAPI sourcelist does not succeed since the current Intel OneAPI PGP key format does not satisfy new apt PGP management requirements.\n\n# Background\n\nSince Debian trixie, the apt was switched PGP management tools to `Sequoia` which require more restricted PGP format and does not have backward compatibility compared with older debian apt.\n\nHowever, the intel OneAPI PGP does not satisfy the new requirement.\n\n# Workaround\n\nWe need to unconditionally trust the Intel OneAPI PGP key by the `trusted=yes`option when we register it to the apt sourcelist.\n\n# Appendix\n- https://community.intel.com/t5/oneAPI-Registration-Download/intel-oneapi-installation-failes-on-debian-trixie-currently/td-p/1655431\n-
