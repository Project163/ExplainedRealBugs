Recent versions of Jfrog Artifactory, as well as Microsoft TFS cannot have their LFS objects mirrored into Gitea because they serve a batch API and the 'download' action in responses is not honored because it's under the field `_links` instead of `actions`.\r\n\r\nThe most recent version of git-lfs still supports this 'deprecated' field: https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/tq/transfer.go#L56 , so a `git lfs pull` would work from one of the servers above using the native client, but not with Gitea.\r\n\r\nI believe Gitea should support both fields to keep parity with native git-lfs clients until such time as they deprecate it (forcing servers like Artifactory to update their responses).\r\n\r\n\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/31512/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
