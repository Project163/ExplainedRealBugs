However, once you click away from one of the textareas, the file upload field disappears.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n- Deploy a Gitea instance\n- Create a repository on your Gitea instance\n- In your repository in the directory `.gitea/issue_template/` add this yaml file (you will need to rename it from `.txt` to `.yaml`): [test_template.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21326733/test_template.txt)\n- Now in the `Issues` section of your repository, create a new issue and select the template we added in the previous step.\n  - This template can be accessed on your demo site [here](https://gitea.com/Alaska-001/Bug-report-template-test/issues/new?template=.gitea%2fissue_template%2ftest_template.yaml), or on the Blender foundation's Gitea instance [here](https://projects.blender.org/Alaska/bug-report-testing/issues/new?template=.gitea%2fissue_template%2ftest_template.yaml)\n- Notice there are two text area inputs. Upload a file to the first textarea. This works correctly.\n- Now click on the second textarea and notice the file you previously uploaded disappears from the UI. This is unexpected, and I personally believe it's a bug.\n\n### Screenshots\n\nHere's a video demonstrating the issue on the demo website: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/903ec6bc-68f8-425f-a6eb-109bd5a90e11\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.25+dev-301-g7413e8583d\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows\n\n### Browser Version\n\nGoogle Chrome 138.0.7204.97","closed_by":{"login":"lunny","id":81045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny","html_url":"https://github.com/lunny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lunny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35125/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/35125/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
