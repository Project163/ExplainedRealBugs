Description\n\nThanks to @sangcheol12 and @Lieslot I found some UI bug. \r\nWhen I check the multi-select checkbox in the issues list, the close button is always shown, even though I have selected closed issues.\r\nThis problem also occurs in pull requests list, because they share same logic. \r\n\r\n[This branch](https://github.com/cloudchamb3r/gitea/tree/fix/issues-is-show-closed) has a fix for this issue. \n\n### Screenshots\n\n## opened issues\r\n<img width=\"1191\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 6 04 48 PM\"
