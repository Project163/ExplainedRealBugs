I'm displaying a scaled down version of the image and then have a href around it so the user can click on the image to get the full size version.  To do this I'm using:\n\n```\n<a href=\"docs/images/gaiden_cpu_pcb_top.png\"><img src=\"docs/images/gaiden_cpu_pcb_top.png\" width=\"40%\"></a>\n```\nThe scaled down image shows correctly but the href url ends up being incorrect.  The directory the markdown file is in is missing from the href url.\n\nI put up a copy of my repo on the demo site so you can see the issue.  The PCB images on the following page\n\nhttps://demo.gitea.com/jwestfall69/mad/src/branch/main/machine/gaiden\n\nHere is the same repo on github, where the href's are correct\n\nhttps://github.com/jwestfall69/mad/tree/main/machine/gaiden\n\n\n\n### Gitea Version\n\nLocal gitea was 1.22.6, but still happens after upgrading to 1.23.5\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n<img width=\"733\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a7efd75-da7a-4560-a28a-6da9fccf0f5f\" />\n\nIn the image the url at the top is `https://demo.gitea.com/jwestfall69/mad/src/branch/main/machine/gaiden` and at the bottom you can see the url it wants to go to if I click on the pcb image is `https://demo.gitea.com/jwestfall69/mad/src/branch/main/machine/docs/images/gaiden_cpu_pcb_top.png`, which is missing the `gaiden` directory the README.md is in.\n\n### Git Version\n\n2.39.5\n\n### Operating System\n\nDebian 12.8\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nI use your downloads for gitea and have it running as a systemd service on Debian 12.8.\n\n### Database\n\nSQLite","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/33972/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
