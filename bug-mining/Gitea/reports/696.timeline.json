setting stdout and stderr to nil instead of an empty builder resolves the issue\nBefore:\n```\nfunc (ctx *mergeContext) PrepareGitCmd(cmd *gitcmd.Command) *gitcmd.Command

cmd.WithEnv(ctx.env).\n\t\tWithDir(ctx.tmpBasePath).\n\t\tWithParentCallerInfo().\n\t\tWithStdout(ctx.outbuf).\n\t\tWithStderr(ctx.errbuf)\n}\n```\nAfter:\n```\nfunc (ctx *mergeContext)

perhaps @lunny can help, other commands run fine as `PrepareGitCmd` is only called in merge flows, it seems.\n\nit stems from using `WithStdout()` or` WithStderr()` set to an empty io.Writer and then the command is called from `RunStdString()` or `RunStdBytes()`\n\nEdit:\nThe test case at \nhttps://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/03fce8f3d0cf3c180f06470257dc09a6c09ec5b0/tests/integration/pull_merge_test.go#L46\n\ndoes not fail because it is required to supply the request form with `head_commit_id ` which will take us to \n```\n\tif expectedHeadCommitID != \"\" {\n\t\ttrackingCommitID, _, err := mergeCtx.PrepareGitCmd(gitcmd.NewCommand(\"show-ref\", \"--hash\").AddDynamicArguments(git.BranchPrefix + trackingBranch)).RunStdString(ctx)\n```\nit's included when calling merge from the UI but not from this test
