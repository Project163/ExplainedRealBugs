Type any text in the editor\n2. Select a text to use as link text\n3. Click the \"Add a link\" button on the toolbar\n4. The editor formats the selection to: `[Example text](url)` (with \"url\" pre-selected)\n5. Paste a URL from clipboard (Ctrl+V)\n\n**Expected behavior:**  \nThe result should be: `[Example text](https://example.com)`\n\n**Actual behavior:**  \nThe result is: `[Example text]([url](https://example.com))`\n\n### Browser\nGoogle Chrome 137.0.7151.104\n\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.24.0\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nYes\n\n### Log Gist\n\n_No response_\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e443bf77-de43-4b6b-a3c0-f78e823eaee2)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98262f96-57fe-4076-bcaa-9df832df2017)\n\nCtrl+V:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/daede592-5bb6-4e47-b8cf-bffc2ab2e903)\n\n### Git Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Operating System\n\nWindows 10 Pro 64-bit\n\n### How are you running Gitea?\n\nDocker\n\n### Database\n\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"wxiaoguang","id":2114189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTQxODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2114189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang","html_url":"https://github.com/wxiaoguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wxiaoguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gitea/gitea/issues/34740/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
