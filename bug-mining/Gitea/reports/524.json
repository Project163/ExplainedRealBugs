This is because it only provides a relative URL (like `/minecraft-pi-reborn/runtime/actions/runs/7/jobs/1`) instead of a full URL (like `https://gitea.thebrokenrail.com/minecraft-pi-reborn/runtime/actions/runs/7/jobs/1`). The issue seems to be caused by [this line](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/1ba7cbbfd6bb758b5c3796dfe46fa688dc20b5d1/services/webhook/matrix.go#L248).\n\n### Gitea Version\n\n1.23.3\n\n### Can you reproduce the bug on the Gitea demo site?\n\nProbably.
