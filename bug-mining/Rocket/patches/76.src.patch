 ### Within Guards
 
 It can also be useful to retrieve managed state from a `FromRequest`

-### Unmanaged State
-
-If you request a `State<T>` for a `T` that is not `managed`, Rocket won't call
-the offending route. Instead, Rocket will log an error message and return a
-**500** error to the client.
-
-While this behavior is 100% safe, it isn't fun to return **500** errors to
-clients, especially when the issue can be easily avoided. Because of this,
-Rocket tries to prevent an application with unmanaged state from ever running
-via the `unmanaged_state` lint. The lint reads through your code at compile-time
-and emits a warning when a `State<T>` request guard is being used in a mounted
-route for a type `T` that isn't being managed.
-
-As an example, consider the following short application using our `HitCount`
-type from previous examples:
-
-```rust
-#[get("/count")]
-fn count(hit_count: State<HitCount>) -> String {
-    let current_count = hit_count.count.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
-    format!("Number of visits: {}", current_count)
-}
-
-fn main() {
-    rocket::ignite()
-        .manage(Config::from(user_input))
-        .launch()
-}
-```
-
-The application is buggy: a value for `HitCount` isn't being `managed`, but a
-`State<HitCount>` type is being requested in the `count` route. When we compile
-this application, Rocket emits the following warning:
-
-```rust
-warning: HitCount is not currently being managed by Rocket
- --> src/main.rs:2:17
-  |
-2 | fn count(hit_count: State<HitCount>) -> String {
-  |                           ^^^^^^^^
-  |
-  = note: this State request guard will always fail
-help: maybe add a call to 'manage' here?
- --> src/main.rs:8:5
-  |
-8 |     rocket::ignite()
-  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
-```
-
-The `unmanaged_state` lint isn't perfect. In particular, it cannot track calls
-to `manage` across function boundaries. Because of this, you may find yourself
-with incorrect warnings. You can disable the lint on a per-route basis by adding
-`#[allow(unmanaged_state)]` to a route handler. If you wish to disable the lint
-globally, add `#![allow(unmanaged_state)]` to your crate attributes.
