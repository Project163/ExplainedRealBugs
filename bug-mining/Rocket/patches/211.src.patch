+# Version 0.5.0-rc.2 (May 9, 2022)
+
+## Major Features and Improvements
+
+  * Introduced [`rocket_db_pools`] for asynchronous database pooling.
+  * Introduced support for [mutual TLS] and client [`Certificate`]s.
+  * Added a [`local_cache_once!`] macro for request-local storage.
+  * Added a [v0.4 to v0.5 migration guide] and [FAQ] the Rocket's website.
+  * Introduced [shutdown fairings].
+
+## Breaking Changes
+
+  * `Hash` `impl`s for `MediaType` and `ContentType` no longer consider media type parameters.
+  * TLS config values are only available when the `tls` feature is enabled.
+  * [`MediaType::with_params()`] and [`ContentType::with_params()`] are now builder methods.
+  * Content-Type [`content`] responder type names are now prefixed with `Raw`.
+  * The `content::Plain` responder is now called `content::RawText`.
+  * TLS config structs are now only available when the `tls` feature is enabled.
+  * Removed `CookieJar::get_private_pending()` in favor of [`CookieJar::get_pending()`].
+  * The [`local_cache!`] macro accepts fewer types. Use [`local_cache_once!`] as appropriate.
+  * When requested, the `FromForm` implementations of `Vec` and `Map`s are now properly lenient.
+  * To concord with browsers, the `[` and `]` characters are now accepted in URI paths.
+  * The `[` and `]` characters are no longer encoded by [`uri!`].
+  * [`Rocket::launch()`] allows `Rocket` recovery by returning the instance after shutdown.
+  * `ErrorKind::Runtime` was removed; [`ErrorKind::Shutdown`] was added.
+
+## General Improvements
+
+  * [`Rocket`] is now `#[must_use]`.
+  * Support for HTTP/2 can be disabled by disabling the default `http2` crate feature.
+  * Added [`rocket::execute()`] for executing Rocket's `launch()` future.
+  * Added the [`context!`] macro to [`rocket_dyn_templates`] for ad-hoc template contexts.
+  * The `time` crate is re-exported from the crate root.
+  * The `FromForm`, `Responder`, and `UriDisplay` derives now fully support generics.
+  * Added helper functions to `serde` submodules.
+  * The [`Shield`] HSTS preload header now includes `includeSubdomains`.
+  * Logging ignores `write!` errors if `stdout` disappears, preventing panics.
+  * Added [`Client::terminate()`] to run graceful shutdown in testing.
+  * Shutdown now terminates the `async` runtime, never the process.
+
+### HTTP
+
+  * Introduced [`Host`] and the [`&Host`] request guard.
+  * Added `Markdown` (`text/markdown`) as a known media type.
+  * Added [`RawStr::percent_encode_bytes()`].
+  * `NODELAY` is now enabled on all connections by default.
+  * The TLS implementation handles handshakes off the main task, improving DoS resistance.
+
+### Request
+
+  * Added [`Request::host()`] to retrieve the client-requested host.
+
+### Trait Implementations
+
+  * `Arc<T>`, `Box<T>` where `T: Responder` now implement `Responder`.
+  * [`Method`] implements `Serialize` and `Deserialize`.
+  * [`MediaType`] and [`ContentType`] implement `Eq`.
+
+### Updated Dependencies
+
+  * The `time` dependency was updated to `0.3`.
+  * The `handlebars` dependency was updated to `4.0`.
+  * The `memcache` dependency was updated to `0.16`.
+  * The `rustls` dependency was updated to `0.20`.
+
+## Infrastructure
+
+  * Rocket now uses the 2021 edition of Rust.
