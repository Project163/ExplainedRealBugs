+When using request guards that modify cookies on-demand, such as
+`FlashMessage`, a similar problem occurs. The fix in this case is to `drop` the
+`Cookies` instance before accessing the `FlashMessage`.

+```rust
+#[get("/")]
+fn bad(cookies: Cookies, flash: FlashMessage) {
+    let msg = flash.msg();
+}

+```rust
+#[get("/")]
+fn good(cookies: Cookies, flash: FlashMessage) {
+    std::mem::drop(cookies);
+    let msg = flash.msg();
