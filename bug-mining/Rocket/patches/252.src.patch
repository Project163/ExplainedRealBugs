+If a rank is not explicitly specified, Rocket assigns a default rank to a route.
+Default ranks range from `-12` to `-1`. This differs from ranks that can be
+assigned manually in a route attribute, which must be positive numbers. The
 default rank prefers static segments over dynamic segments in both paths and
 queries: the _more_ static a route's path and query are, the higher its
 precedence.
 
-There are three "colors" to paths and queries:
+There are three "colors" assignable to each path and query:
 
   1. `static`, meaning all components are static
   2. `partial`, meaning at least one component is dynamic
   3. `wild`, meaning all components are dynamic
 
+Additionally, a query may have _no_ color (`none`) if there is no query.

 Static paths carry more weight than static queries. The same is true for partial
 and wild paths. This results in the following default ranking table:
