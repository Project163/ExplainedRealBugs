For example: `/user/add` and `/survey/add`. Both routes are in different modules.\r\n\r\n- Rocket version: Master branch\r\n- Rust version: rustc 1.46.0-nightly (346aec9b0 2020-07-11)\r\n- Os: Linux Mint 20 Cinnamon Edition (beta)\r\n\r\nHere is a small working example of my code:\r\n```rust\r\n#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]\r\n\r\n#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;\r\nuse tokio::runtime;\r\n\r\nmod survey {\r\n    #[get(\"/survey/add\")]\r\n    pub fn add() {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmod user {\r\n    #[get(\"/user/add\")]\r\n    pub fn add() {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let mut rb = runtime::Builder::new()\r\n        .basic_scheduler().enable_all().build().unwrap();\r\n\r\n    rb.block_on(rocket::ignite()\r\n        .mount(\"/\", routes![survey::add, user::add])\r\n        .launch()).unwrap();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything works fine until I start to add some documentation like this:\r\n```rust\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    /// Route to add a survey.\r\n    #[get(\"/survey/add\")]\r\n    pub fn add() {\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    /// Route to add a user.\r\n    #[get(\"/user/add\")]\r\n    pub fn add() {\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm able to document the first route but after the second one I get the following error message from the compiler:\r\n```rust\r\nerror[E0428]: the name `rocket_uri_macro_add9134641248968336068` is defined multiple times\r\n  --> src/main.rs:16:5\r\n   |\r\n8  |     #[get(\"/survey/add\")]\r\n   |     --------------------- previous definition of the macro `rocket_uri_macro_add9134641248968336068` here\r\n...\r\n16 |     #[get(\"/user/add\")]\r\n   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `rocket_uri_macro_add9134641248968336068` redefined here\r\n   |\r\n   = note: `rocket_uri_macro_add9134641248968336068` must be defined only once in the macro namespace of this module\r\n   = note: this error originates in an attribute macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis only happens if the routes end similarly. It should be possible to document routes of this type.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1373/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
