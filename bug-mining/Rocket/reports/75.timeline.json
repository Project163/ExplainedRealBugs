For instance, if there are two routes, the first with an `AdminUser` guard and the second with a `User` guard, both will need to query the database; this may be quite expensive. It would be nice if Rocket had a facility to cache the retrieved data for the lifetime of the request. This can also help with being consistent about decisions through the request. We don't want to see changes to the data source while a single request is being processed. \r\n\r\n## Design\r\n\r\nThe _request-local state cache_ will be accessible anywhere an `&Request` is available. Any state stored in the request-local state cache is dropped along with the Request. Access to the cache is typed in a similar vain to managed state. Unlike managed state, however, accessing request-local cached state is _infallible_: accesses cannot fail. This design decision makes it significantly more difficult to misuse request-local cached state. Curtailing errors here is particularly important as accesses to request-local cached state are likely to be in the hot-path of request processing, and thus failures here result in user-visible errors.\r\n\r\nAccessing (setting and retrieving) request-local cached state is accomplished via a single method on `Request` of the following form:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl<'r> Request<'r> {\r\n    /// Retrieves the cached value for type `T` from the request-local cached\r\n    /// state of `self`. If no such value has previously been cached for\r\n    /// this request, `f` is called to produce the value which is subsequently\r\n    /// returned.\r\n    fn local_cache<T, F>(&self, f: F) -> &T\r\n        where T: Send + 'r,\r\n              F: FnOnce(&Request) -> T;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that there are no failure modes for this method.\r\n\r\nThe method places a `Send` restriction on the stored typed `T`; this is required so that a `Request` can be transferred to another thread to be handled there. While this doesn't happen at the moment, it will happen with certainty in the future. \r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThe implementation is straight-forward:\r\n\r\n  1. Add a new `cache: state::Container` field to the `RequestState` struct in `core/lib/src/request.rs` and initialize it as empty in `Request::new`. The `Container` type is from the [`state`] crate.\r\n\r\n  2. Implement the `local_cache` method by:\r\n\r\n     a. Calling `cache.try_get` and returning the value if it exists.\r\n\r\n     b. Calling `cache.set(f())` if the value doesn't exist followed by `cache.get()`.\r\n\r\n[`state`]: https://sergio.bz/rustdocs/state/\r\n\r\nThe `state::Container` type of `state` requires that the type of any values stored implement `Send + Sync + 'static`, but the bounds for `T` in `local_cache` aren't as strict. As a result, either the `state` crate should be extended to allow values with more lenient bounds or the `local_cache` method must enforce the stricter bounds. \r\n\r\nTo start, the latter will suffice, but the former should be implemented before public release.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/395124033/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"vhakulinen","id":4594126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1OTQxMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4594126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vhakulinen","html_url":"https://github.com/vhakulinen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vhakulinen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vhakulinen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vhakulinen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vhakulinen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vhakulinen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vhakulinen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vhakulinen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vhakulinen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vhakulinen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-06T17:58:07Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T17:58:07Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/655","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/655/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/655/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/655/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/pull/655","id":329972138,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTkzMDkzNjMw","number":655,"title":"Implement

if this has been addressed, but I could not find anything while searching. I want to be able to do timing of requests in my rocket application for logging and metrics. I could not find any information on best practises for doing that. I know that the fairing documentation says that it should be possible.\r\n\r\nTo do timing, I need to, as far as I know, be able to save a request start time in `on_request`, and then fetch that and calculate the ellapsed time in `on_response`. The only way I have found to do that, is by saving the start time to a header. And serializing a SystemTime as a string feels wrong.\r\n\r\nAnother concern is that on_response happens when the router has finished the response, but it has not been sent to the user yet. I would like to also time how long it takes to stream the response to the user.\r\n\r\nRocket version:

have a simple fairing doing time measurements for the request. What we do is we capture \"start\" time in the `on_request` handler and measure elapsed time in the `on_response` handler.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems like there are not a lot of options to save that \"start\" timestamp. One can add a header to the request and check it later in the response, but that requires converting timestamp into a string (and it seems `std::time::Instant` is not friendly to to_string/parse). Also, that opens a potential attack as headers are partially under the control of the caller (you have to be careful to use `replace_header` versus `add_header`).\r\n\r\nOther option would be to use thread-local, which is probably going to work, but can we rely that `on_response` would be called on the same thread? I think, we can, but documentation does not mention that explicitly.\r\n\r\nOr maybe keep our own hash map, but then we need a way to identify a request and also to make sure that we clean that map no matter what (like, request catastrophically fails that `on_response` is never called).\r\n\r\n>1.

I'm using the latest version of Rocket and it's pretty fun to work with. I'm using it to write a restful API service. I followed the guide and added a few routes to test it out just to familiarize myself. I've a few questions because I'm stuck at finding tutorials that walk us through how to protect or secure API endpoints or routes with Rocket.\r\n\r\nI'm curious if we can do that in Rocket? Like how do we use a \"API key\" to authorize a user can access my api routes and how can I implement rate limiting in Rocket?\r\n\r\nLast but not least, I was trying to follow the ssl example. I was wondering if it's possible to include the cert and pem in environment variables instead of writing the path in the file itself? will that be safer?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/679/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13766681946,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzqMt84Tqb2azwAAAAM0juVa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/13766681946","actor":{"login":"Eijebong","id":3650385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTAzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3650385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong","html_url":"https://github.com/Eijebong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"97c6b3ace842747e5ba5e4d323f09e1be0278c5d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Eijebong/Rocket/commits/97c6b3ace842747e5ba5e4d323f09e1be0278c5d","created_at":"2024-08-05T16:10:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13766682016,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzqMt84Tqb2azwAAAAM0juWg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/13766682016","actor":{"login":"Eijebong","id":3650385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTAzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3650385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong","html_url":"https://github.com/Eijebong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d1cfdbaa8e575c4f0b8a0509b06356cd0ffb1987","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Eijebong/Rocket/commits/d1cfdbaa8e575c4f0b8a0509b06356cd0ffb1987","created_at":"2024-08-05T16:10:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
