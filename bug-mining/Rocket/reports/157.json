There are no real links to further details of higher-level implementation of something like diesel and the links that are there seem to be middleware-like for r2d2 -> rocket.rs bindings.\r\n\r\nI have also searched online for more guides with setting up diesel-based databases but all I have so far came across is an external article on medium.com ([source](https://medium.com/swlh/a-simple-crud-on-rust-with-rocket-rs-and-diesel-rs-e885672cb23d)) which isn't what i'm looking for and a [SQLite-based `examples/` todo list](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/tree/v0.4/examples/todo) which doesn't seem to mirror the official guide tutorial, importing diesel and such directly. \r\n\r\n*Overall, my request is more higher-level documentation for databases as the current guide feels more like an insignificant footnote in the docs.*\r\n\r\n## General Comments\r\n\r\nApologies that this issue is quite broad; just feels like this section of the guide is not up to par with many other parts. Not a contributer myself, just a user of rocket.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1447/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
