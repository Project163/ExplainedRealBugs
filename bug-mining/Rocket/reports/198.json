This is due to Windows' support for paths like `D:test.txt`, which are relative despite referring to a drive, and as such completely skip `rocket`'s path validation which only checks for `:` directly at the end of segments.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nTake any code using `FileServer` like https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/tree/master/examples/static-files and give it a path such as `D:test.txt` with the server on windows and a drive at `D:/test.txt` (since this is a relative-to-disk path, make sure that `D:/` is the current path on the `D:` drive). The server will return the contents with no error code.\r\n\r\nEDIT: This can actually just be reproduced by using a path like `C:../whatever` - which is effectively equivalent to `..`-ing out of the server running directory (as long as the server is running on `C:`), at least in my testing, so this can be used to escape the intended served folder regardless of other drives being available.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\n404 as this would be returning a file outside of the served folder.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n - OS Distribution and Kernel: Windows 10\r\n - Rocket Version: 0.5.0-rc.1\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\n\r\nRocket needs to validate segments more - a possible but perhaps overbearing fix would be to simply disallow `:` in paths everywhere rather than just at the end.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1949/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1949/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
