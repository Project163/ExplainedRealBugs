currently not possible to tap into Rocket's logging infrastructure in any easy way. Of course, logging is important, and so it's necessary to have a nice, clean API for Rocket applications to log messages. Libraries like [slog](https://github.com/slog-rs/slog) and [log](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/log), the latter currently used by Rocket, provide nice, structured ways to do this. Look into restructuring Rocket's logging to expose their functionalities.\r\n\r\nThe current alternative is to simply `println` to log.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/21/reactions","total_count":54,"+1":52,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
