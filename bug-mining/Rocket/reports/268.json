Please describe.**\r\n> \r\n> Currently the `serde::msgpack::MsgPack` included with rocket only does \"compact serialization\", meaning it doesn't serialize key names, only values in arrays. To be JSON compatible, and to avoid bugs it would be nice to have \"named serialization\".\r\n> \r\n> **Why this feature can't or shouldn't live outside of Rocket**\r\n> \r\n> The `serde::msgpack` is already in rocket.\r\n> \r\n> **Ideal Solution**\r\n> \r\n> It seems the problem is here: https://github.com/Rocket-org/Rocket/blob/cc0621626bf5e917ea1d4c1e29a327e9a7871921/core/lib/src/serde/msgpack.rs#L191 This should be changed to `rmp_serde::to_vec_named`, however since I'm still fairly new to rust, I don't know how this would be exposed so that the developer can choose either from the compact or named serialization form.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"the10thWiz","id":16281943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjgxOTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16281943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz","html_url":"https://github.com/the10thWiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2107/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
