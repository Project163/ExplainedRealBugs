Functionality**\r\n\r\nThis is just a minor cosmetic issue that came up after migrating to 0.5-rc2.\r\n\r\nThe rc-2 release added two things:\r\n- `launch` now returns an instance of `Rocket<Ignite>`\r\n- `Rocket<T>` must be used.\r\n\r\nPreviously I have used a simple main like this:\r\n```\r\n#[rocket::main]\r\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), rocket::Error> {\r\n    my_build().await?.launch().await?\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWith the two changes I have to do this now.\r\n```\r\n#[rocket::main]\r\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), rocket::Error> {\r\n    _ = my_build().await?.launch().await?;\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI have found in the section of `general improvements` that this is by design, can I ask why? I feel like both of these can serve a purpose (although I personally don't see it right now) but they feel a bit clunky when put together.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Changes**\r\n\r\nI don't know if it is possible to have `#[must_use]` only for some of the generic Rockets. If we could have `Rocket<Recovered>` which would not have to be used I think that would be great.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I would propose to not make the rocket recoverable and keep the original API, but I expect there to be a use case I am not considering. I am happy to close this if both the changes serve a purpose.\r\n\r\nMaybe adding a `scrape` function (or whatever happens to old rockets after deorbiting) to more clearly get rid of the instance would also be fine (but arguably we can alredy assign it to `_` or drop it or do anything else with it).\r\n\r\n**Alternatives Considered**\r\n\r\nUsing the snippet as shown above.\r\n\r\nUsing `#[rocket::launch]`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2168/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11603836543,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzqMt85H6hc8zwAAAAKzpH5_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/11603836543","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"82cd53de366f8080d12f26d9a1fc67cc24c612ef","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Necmttn/Rocket/commits/82cd53de366f8080d12f26d9a1fc67cc24c612ef","created_at":"2024-01-26T01:03:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
