One thing that confused me is the use of `macro_use`, `extern crate`, and `serde_derive`, none of which I believe are necessary any more (or at least they do not appear to be in my testing). For example, the tera_template example currently begins with:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;\r\n#[macro_use] extern crate serde_derive;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I am able to serve templates through routes with:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse rocket::{get, routes};\r\nuse rocket_contrib::templates::Template;\r\nuse serde::Serialize;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOf course, I have the serde \"derive\" feature enabled.\r\n\r\nI also noticed another line in the doc that seems to perhaps not be currently, namely that `#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]` must be in the crate entrypoint; I have it instead in a library module and things are working well.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to submit a pull request containing this kind of update, but wanted to get some feedback on all of this first. Maybe there's some reason that I'm unaware of that the currently documented way is preferred? I'm relatively new to Rust, so it's hard for me to know.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1156/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1156/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
