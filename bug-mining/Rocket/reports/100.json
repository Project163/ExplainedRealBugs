I'm using the `reqwest` library which means that I create a `rocket::response::Response` out of a `reqwest::response::Response`. As part of this conversion process, I take all of the headers from the `reqwest` response and I set them on the `rocket` response. \r\n\r\nThe issue I'm facing is with the `server` header. When I manually set it in the Rocket Response, its value seems to get overwritten to \"Rocket\". For example, right before returning a response from my app, the contents of the header looks something like:\r\n```\r\ncontent-type: text/plain\r\naccept-ranges: none\r\nlast-modified: Thu, 02 May 2019 23:39:54 GMT\r\ncontent-length: 230\r\ndate: Wed, 08 May 2019 21:02:13 GMT\r\nserver: MY_VALUE\r\nconnection: close\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when I inspect the headers from the client side, I see that the `server` value was overwritten:\r\n```\r\n< HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n< content-type: text/plain\r\n< accept-ranges: none\r\n< last-modified: Thu, 02 May 2019 23:39:54 GMT\r\n< Content-Length: 230\r\n< date: Wed, 08 May 2019 21:02:13 GMT\r\n< server: Rocket\r\n< connection: close\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there any way to disable or overcome this behavior?","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/996/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
