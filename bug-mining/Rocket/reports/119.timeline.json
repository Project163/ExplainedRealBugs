In particular, each route generates a corresponding macro in the crate's global namespace. Since the names must be unique, they are disambiguated by hashing the `file_name`, `line`, and `column` of the function - this should provide a unique hash, and usually does...\r\n\r\nuntil you add documentation with `///`. It looks like this causes rust-lang/rust#43081, and one of the effects of that bug is that both routes appear to be at line 1, column 0 of the file and hash the same.\r\n\r\nSome workarounds that you can use today:\r\n\r\n* Put the routes in different *files*. `file_name` is also part of the hash and it appears to be unaffected by the `rustc` bug.\r\n* Use `#[doc = \"\"]` instead of the `///` syntax sugar, which also seems to avoid the bug. This is very ugly, even for a workaround.\r\n* Name the routes differently, e.g. `add_survey` and `add_user`. The name of the route is part of the macro name, so this will make them unambiguous.\r\n\r\nOne really awkward workaround rocket might be able to do is to hash more, such as the function *contents*. Another awkward workaround in rocket would be to randomly generate the disambiguator instead of deriving it from the input.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/657938474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3542245404,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1NDIyNDU0MDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/3542245404","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-14T03:03:41Z","label":{"name":"deficiency","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3542245406,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM1NDIyNDU0MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/3542245406","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-14T03:03:41Z","label":{"name":"upstream","color":"0052cc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/657966044","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1373#issuecomment-657966044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1373","id":657966044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1Nzk2NjA0NA==","user":{"login":"igalic","id":497249,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NzI0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/497249?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalic","html_url":"https://github.com/igalic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igalic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-14T04:56:05Z","updated_at":"2020-07-14T04:56:05Z","bo
