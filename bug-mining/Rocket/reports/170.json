The route works fine, because of the `FromParam` implementation on `rocket_contrib::uuid::Uuid`. However, I get the following error when trying to use the UUID in the `uri!` macro:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthe trait `rocket::http::uri::FromUriParam<rocket::http::uri::Path, _>` is not implemented for `rocket_contrib::uuid::Uuid`\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't think documentation is required here, provided that I'm correct in my assessment of the situation, but I do think that it would be nice if `rocket_contrib::uuid::Uuid` implemented FromUriParam. Or I'm missing something and it actually does.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1299/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
