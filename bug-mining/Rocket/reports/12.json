Repeating the same example (on 0.1.2):\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\n#[get(\"/sample/<path..>\")]\r\nfn stream(path: PathBuf) -> Option<NamedFile> {\r\n    let filename = Path::new(\"/home/dawid/a_directory\").join(path.clone());\r\n    println!(\"{:?}, {:?}\", filename, path);\r\n    NamedFile::open(filename).ok()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works fine now when `stream` is mounted at the root and I request `http://localhost:8000/sample/dir/file.txt`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /sample/dir/file.txt:\r\n    => Matched: GET /sample/<path..>\r\n\"/home/dawid/a_directory/dir/file.txt\", \"dir/file.txt\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, if I mount `stream` under a segment, per:\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\n…\r\n         .mount(\"/abc/\", routes![stream])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I request `http://localhost:8000/abc/sample/dir/file.txt`, it is processed as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /abc/sample/dir/file.txt:\r\n    => Matched: GET /abc/sample/<path..>\r\n\"/home/dawid/a_directory/sample/dir/file.txt\", \"sample/dir/file.txt\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the `sample` segment has crept back in.
