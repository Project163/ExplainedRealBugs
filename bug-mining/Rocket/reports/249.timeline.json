If they were to downgrade their MSRV, Rocket would compile on 1.56, at least that's the theory. A different way to say that is that Rocket itself should compile with 1.56, but its dependencies appear to need at least 1.66, whereas at some point that wasn't the case. This is an issue with the MSRV Cargo.toml field in general: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9930.\n\nI'm not really sure what the best course of action is. If we choose the min MSRV of all of our dependencies, we miss out on a lower MSRV if a dependency were to make that possible in an update. If we choose the min MSRV for Rocket itself, then the MSRV may be incorrect when dependencies are taken into consideration.\n\nThere is no correct answer, it seems, at least not today. Even MSRV-aware dependency resolution is fraught with issues: you'd need to hold back updating dependencies, even when those updates are security sensitive. Perhaps the most practical answer is to choose the min MSRV across all dependencies at a point in time, or perhaps it's to eschew setting an MSRV altogether.
