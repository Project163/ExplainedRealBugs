In particular, the internal URI storage type for `Redirect` was changed from `String` to `Uri`.\r\n\r\nThe `Uri` type in Rocket only supports URIs in origin form (`/a/b/c`); other URIs are normalized to origin form. This normalization is applied to any string used as a `Uri`. This normalization results in incorrect URIs when the passed in string is not fit for normalization. In particular, in this issue, @Korvox notes that absolute-form URIs (`http://google.com`) are incorrectly normalized.\r\n\r\nThe fix I'd like to take is to expand the `Uri` type to support all request targets (origin forms, absolute forms, authority forms, and asterisk forms). This type would be similar to the [`Uri`](https://docs.rs/http/0.1.0/http/uri/struct.Uri.html) type in the `http` crate. Critically different, however, is that Rocket's `Uri` type will support creation without allocation as well as querying to check the form kind (ie: absolute? asterisk?, etc.). This latter ability is presently used by Rocket.\r\n\r\nThis expansion will be a full rewrite of the `Uri` type with a complete, zero-allocation URI parser that conforms to [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3). I've started the rewrite and have reached and surpassed parity with the existing `Uri` type. I plan on having a complete implementation soon.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/334606894/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1280836800,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTI4MDgzNjgwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/1280836800","actor":{"login":"Korvox","id":1096937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTY5Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1096937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox","html_url":"https://github.com/Korvox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-10-05T22:13:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1280836801,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEyODA4MzY4MDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/1280836801","actor":{"login":"Korvox","id":1096937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTY5Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1096937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox","html_url":"https://github.com/Korvox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Korvox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-10-05T22:13:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1758795872,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTc1ODc5NTg3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/1758795872","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"56c6a96f6a94ab844a0f571c303d741c7ec668d3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/commits/56c6a96f6a94ab844a0f571c303d741c7ec668d3","created_at":"2018-07-29T07:53:

comment is pedantic, but I thought I'd mention it anyway.\r\n\r\n@SergioBenitez what you implemented is not a URI parser but a \"Request Target\" parser, as specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3. A Request Target is not a URI, though it is strongly related in that is is defined by reference to the URI specification https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986.

Background\r\n\r\nRocket 0.4 [introduced Typed URIs](https://rocket.rs/v0.4/news/2018-12-08-version-0.4/#typed-uris) and a new [`Uri` type](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.4/rocket/http/uri/enum.Uri.html). The `uri!` macro and strict `Uri` validation is a valuable addition to Rocket's API and is a great example of Rocket's promise of safety and correctness, but there are a few problems with it due to deficiencies and/or bugs in Rocket and in browsers.\r\n\r\nThis is a summary of the following issues and PRs:\r\n\r\n- [x] #842 - URI References /  `Uri` type does not support anchors.\r\n- [x] #853 - Support for absolute `Uri`s / generate absolute URIs from `uri!()`.\r\n- [x] #880/#882 - matching Url-Escaped Routes/match percent decoded urls\r\n- [x] #924/#941 - Un-encoded curly braces fail to parse/Allow more unencoded characters in query strings\r\n- [x] https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/998#issuecomment-544169526\r\n- #995 - (needs some confirmation/testing) Path segments must be valid UTF-8\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n* `Uri` does not appear to support fragments in any URI from\r\n  * Workaround: Servers should only deal with fragments in URIs they generate, and most of those can be done via `format!`.\r\n  * Possible solution: add fragment support, but disallow it or treat it as part of the path/query in incoming URIs \r\n* `Location` uses `Uri` and is therefore too strict about which kinds of URIs it accepts (no relative URI, no fragment)\r\n  * Workaround: Manually set the header as a string.\r\n  * Possible solution: Add support for relative URIs and URIs with fragments to `Location` and/or `Uri`\r\n* `Uri` is strict about characters such as `{` needing to be percent-encoded\r\n  * Several browsers send `{` and other characters unencoded, even when they ought to be encoded.\r\n  * **There is currently no workaround**. If a user enters a `{` or certain other relatively innocent charactesr in a plain HTML form submitted with the GET method, Rocket may refuse to process the request entirely.\r\n  * Possible solution: Allow `{` and some other commonly unencoded characters. Clearly document how this adheres or purposefully does not adhere to the relevant standard and why.\r\n* (unconfirmed) `>` isn't even legal in the HTTP header, according to hyper 0.10? Worth double-checking what's going on here.\r\n* Route matching to the request URI is sensitive to percent encoding (e.g. `$` does not match `%24`).\r\n  * **There is currently no workaround**\r\n  * Possible solution: Follow an algorithm such as the one outlined in RFC 3986 §6 to do normalization when doing route comparison.\r\n\r\n## Requests\r\n* `uri!` only takes a string literal that must parse as an `Origin` as its mount point part.\r\n  * Workaround: Manually paste URI together via `format!`.\r\n  * Feature requested: Support any runtime-provided `Uri` as the mount point\r\n  * Possible solution: Accept any `Into<Uri>` as a mount point. Maybe with a special case - string literals can be checked via `TryInto<Uri>` at compile time and raise an error if they are invalid.\r\n* `uri!` with `Option` query parameters works surprisingly (e.g. https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/827#issuecomment-521585546)\r\n\r\n## What next?\r\n\r\nRecapitulating what I wrote in https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/924#issuecomment-470386375:\r\n\r\nRocket states that it adheres to RFC 7230, which relies on RFC 3986 for many of its URI-related definitions. But strictly adhering to RFC 3986 means that some URLs sent by browsers will be rejected as invalid. WHATWG's URL living standard is intended to replace previous URL standards, but it is still a moving target.\r\n\r\nI think the **first step to take** is to decide if WHATWG's URL living standard is an acceptable specification for Rocket to follow at this time. If it is not suitable, careful and documented deviance from the currently followed specification(s) should be made for the few places that browsers do something different from our expectations.\r\n\r\nThere are approximately three decisions to be made as I see it:\r\n\r\n* What URI/URL standard to follow - RFC 7230 or WHATWG are the only realistic standards I know of at this time\r\n* When and how to decode and normalize; either as URIs come in or as they are compared to routes, and which encoding tables to use\r\n* Extending `Uri` with support for relative URIs and fragments, or loosening the requirements to use `Uri` in places such as `Location`\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I don't want to review or merge a bunch of PRs that modify URI handling without a clear roadmap for doing so in a holistic way.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI will follow up with my own opinions on some of these choices, but I would like to get a feel for what other users of and contributors to Rocket expect as well.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/998/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/998/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/720134859","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/443#issuecomment-720134859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/443","id":720134859,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMDEzNDg1OQ==","user":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-01T18:54:26Z","updated_at":"2020-11-01T18:54:26Z","body":"> This comment is pedantic, but I thought I'd mention it anyway.\r\n> \r\n> @SergioBenitez what you implemented is not a URI parser but a \"Request Target\" parser, as specified in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3. A Request Target is not a URI, though it is strongly related in that is is defined by reference to the URI specification https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986. Strictly speaking only the absolute-form of Request Target is a URI (though not any URI).\r\n> \r\n> The `http` crate had made the same \"mistake\" of calling the type `Uri` rather than `RequestTarget`. Personally, I think the technically-correct name is preferable, even though it's not nice and short as `Uri`.\r\n\r\nMy apologies for responding two years late; I'm only now working through the related URI issues. I simply wanted to state that I was and am aware of the differences, and that my use of the name `Uri` here is largely colloquial in nature but also refers to URI _references_ (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.1), though I'm also aware that `Uri` is not actually parsing URI references. We _could_ call it `RequestTarget`, but my feeling is that most users have never heard the term \"request target\", and so the name would simply confuse rather than aid. And, while `Uri` may also mislead users into believing that `Uri` _always_ represents a full URI, my feeling is that the name is more intuitive, and that the context in which `Uri` is used resolves ambiguity.\r\n\r\nI understand your point, and I agree on technical standing alone, but ultimately we choose names to convey meaning, and in this, I feel that `Uri` gets us closest, even if it is technically
