The most complete of those available is [multipart](https://github.com/abonander/multipart). Unfortunately its API is rather restrictive at the moment, and so it wouldn't be a good fit for Rocket.

Rocket.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/273401826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":927015404,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTI3MDE1NDA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/927015404","actor":{"login":"Zeludon","id":7567017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjcwMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7567017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon","html_url":"https://github.com/Zeludon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-18T07:19:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":927015405,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDkyNzAxNTQwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/927015405","actor":{"login":"Zeludon","id":7567017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NjcwMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7567017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon","html_url":"https://github.com/Zeludon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Zeludon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-18T07:19:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/277310239","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/106#issuecomment-277310239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/106","id":277310239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzMxMDIzOQ==","user":{"login":"Maaarcocr","id":9624267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MjQyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9624267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maaarcocr","html_url":"https://github.com/Maaarcocr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maaarcocr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maaarcocr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maaarcocr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maaarcocr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maaarcocr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maaarcocr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maaarcocr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maaarcocr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Maaarcocr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-03T17:31:53Z","updated_at":"2017-02-03T17:31:53Z","body":"I'm

Thanks for the snippet! One particular concern with your code is that you read all of the form data into memory with no limit. This means that, for instance, if a user uploads a 500MB file, the entire file will reside in memory even though it could have been streamed to disk. Or, worse, if a user sends you data infinitely, the request will exhaust the memory resources on the server, likely crashing
