IE, perhaps you don't want to leak a route's existence. By returning 404 irrespective of whether a route exists or not, you avoid this.\n\nThat being said, my intent is for routing to be completely customizable, and I would advocate for making it simply to change the default \"route not found\" status code in such a case. \n\nUntil then, I would advocate for the custom fairing route. The implementation is very straightforward and clean.

There's no code to just _take_, and nothing particularly helpful in that regard. We could trivially modify Rocket to emit a different error code based on how routing evolved - the question is whether we should without also providing the ability to _not_.

All i want is for requests to routes with invalid params to hit the 422 or 400 catcher as that is correct. not 404. and even in the 404 catcher there's no way to check how many times the Request object forwarded to override the response as a 400 and not a 404\r\n\r\ncan provide an example of how to make such a fairing do this?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1763634144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Directory","id":26686708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Njg2NzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26686708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Directory","html_url":"https://github.com/Directory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Directory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Directory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Directory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Directory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Directory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Directory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Directory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Directory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Directory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1763976726","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2626#issuecomment-1763976726","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2626","id":1763976726,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzqMt85pJCYW","user":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-16T08:25:49Z","updated_at":"2023-10-16T08:25:49Z","body":">
