I'm under the impression that this is because FromFormValue::from_form_value() and subsequently SocketAddrV4::from_str() is being called with the encoded address as a parameter (e.g. 127.0.0.1%3A80) instead of 127.0.0.1:80.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm)]\r\nstruct Input {\r\n    ip: SocketAddrV4,\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[post(\"/test\", data = \"<input>\")]\r\nfn test(input: Form<Input>) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code will not parse input such as 127.0.0.1:80 because the colon ':' is encoded. This results in 127.0.0.1%3A80 being passed into FromFormValue::from_form_value() which will fail.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
