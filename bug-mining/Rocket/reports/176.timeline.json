should now be straightforward to implement. I recommend a mechanism similar to that of `validate`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm)]\r\nstruct Form<'r> {\r\n    #[field(default = \"this\")]\r\n    value: String,\r\n    #[field(default = \"this\")]\r\n    value2: &'r str,\r\n    #[field(default = \"this\".to_uppercase())]\r\n    value3: String,\r\n    #[field(default = or_this())]\r\n    value4: &'r str,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, allow any expression, call `.into()` on it, force the value to be `T` where `T` is the form field:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet default: #T = #expr;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll need to ensure inference doesn't mess with things like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm)]\r\nstruct Form {\r\n    #[field(default = 10)]\r\n    value: u8,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, it is sometimes desired to have the FromForm implementation fail even when a type has a `FromFormValue::default` implemenation.\r\n\r\nWe could either change the expression to return `Option<T>`, sacrificing the `.into()` niceness, so you could do:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm)]\r\nstruct Form {\r\n    #[field(default = None)]\r\n    boolean: bool,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr we could change the `Strict` guard to disallow defaults:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm)]\r\nstruct Form {\r\n    boolean: Strict<bool>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr we could add a new form guard that disallows defaults:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm)]\r\nstruct Form {\r\n    boolean: Exists<bool>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr some special syntax in the field:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm)]\r\nstruct Form {\r\n    #[field(default = _)]\r\n    boolean: bool,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI like the idea of `Strict` paying double-duty.

the title implies, this request is all about some extra functionallity for `#[derive(FromForm]`.  \r\nWhen using the derive on a form like follows\r\n``` rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm)]\r\npub struct Foo {\r\n    pub bar: i16,\r\n    pub baz: String,\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[post(\"/login\", data = \"<user>\")]\r\nfn login(user: LenientForm<Foo>) -> &'static str {\r\n    \"Hello, world!\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand the form does not carry any value for `bar` the [`default()`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.4/rocket/request/trait.FromFormValue.html#method.default) function of `FromFormValue` is called, if implemented.  \r\nBut this enforces a \"global\" default for the type, which you can not easily set per `FromForm`.\r\n\r\nSo with this feature request i would propose something like this\r\n``` rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm)]\r\npub struct Foo {\r\n    #[form(default = 1)]\r\n    pub bar: i16,\r\n    pub baz: String,\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis way a \"local\" default value can be defined for a type for each form on which it is used.  \r\nI guess this would still work with the \"global\" default value, as such that if a \"local\" default is present, use it otherwise fallback to the \"global\" one. I'm not exactly sure what should be done for structs, but i think a function invocation to get a default value should be possible, like `#[form(default = i16::default())]`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/813047246","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1536#issuecomment-813047246","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1536","id":813047246,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxMzA0NzI0Ng==","user":{"login":"somehowchris","id":38954618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTU0NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38954618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris","html_url":"https://github.com/somehowchris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-04T14:59:48Z","updated_at":"2021-04-04T14:59:48Z","body":"These things sound awesome and are the excact things I am looking for right now.
