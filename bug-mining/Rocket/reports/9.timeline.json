#42 was addressed, however, it did not fix the issue on Windows systems. Template names were being parsed using Windows paths, so a file like `templates/posts/new.html.tera`, was given the name `posts\\new`, resulting in the template not being found for the name `posts/new`. \r\n\r\nTo fix this, I just added a string replace, when compiling for Windows, to replace `\\` characters with `/`, when generating the template name. \r\n\r\nI also included some basic unit tests, and split some of the name logic into separate functions so as to help facilitate said unit tests.
