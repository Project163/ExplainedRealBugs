Certain endpoints can have different pipelines (think `/app` which serves HTML vs. `/api` which serves JSON). Due to the way its implemented, it yields very high performance. I would imagine, since Rust offers some nice zero-cost abstractions and the pipelines would be defined statically during compile time, that this would allow for some nice compile-time

It feels like a crutch and catch-all for things that don't fit into a framework's model. It's difficult to work with, and more importantly, hard to follow and understand. Rocket _will not_ support middleware in the customary sense. There _must_ be a better way, and I hope we discover it.\r\n\r\nI believe there is a category of problems for which _something like_ middleware, but much, much lighter, is a good fit. Let's call these undiscovered, light-weight things \"_fairings_\".\r\n\r\nFairings should be able to handle situations for which request guards, data handlers, parameter handlers, and responders are a poor fit. Rocket's been in the public eye for about a month, and I think we've discovered a few cases for which fairings would be a good fit:\r\n\r\n  1. CORS\r\n  2. HTTP Caching\r\n  3. Request/response timing/profiling\r\n  4. Security mechanisms like CSRF\r\n\r\nThe following are things typically handled with middleware that I believe Rocket's primitives handle in a superior fashion:\r\n\r\n  1. Data handling/parsing/validation (via `data` handlers)\r\n  2. Policy and authentication (via request guards and forwarding)\r\n  3. Asset rendering (via responders)\r\n\r\nOne common use for middleware is to pass pre-processing information to request handlers. Interestingly, none of the instances identified have a need to pass information. The `CORS` fairing either short-circuits request handling or adds headers to the response. The `HTTP Caching` fairing would do the same. The timing firing doesn't modify the request/response structures or path at all but needs a mechanism to retrieve information from the pre-processing side. Indeed, I'd like to find a solution that maintains this invariant: information should never directly flow from pre-processors to request handlers.\r\n\r\nTo the community: what would you like to do with fairings? What other use cases are Rocket's existing primitives a poor fit for? Let's work together to find a better solution.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/274655441/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":933715430,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDkzMzcxNTQzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/933715430","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-23T23:49:17Z","label":{"name":"feedback wanted","color":"006b75"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/274680290","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/55#issuecomment-274680290","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/55","id":274680290,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDY4MDI5MA==","user":{"login":"mehcode","id":753919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzkxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/753919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode","html_url":"https://github.com/mehcode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-24T02:08:12Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T02:27:56Z","body":"Not sure I agree on premise (middleware is bad) but I'll talk through the use cases.

My apologies if I did! Certainly not my intention!\r\n\r\nMy \"mental model\" is surely no different than yours. I wouldn't even go as far as to call it a \"mental model\"; it's simply what middleware is: code that sits before and/or after a request/response and optionally modifies the request/response and/or adds information to the request for later use. My concept of middleware is based on its implementation in frameworks such as Rails (through Rack), Django, and Laravel.\r\n\r\nMy main objection to the general idea is that middleware tends to hide the flow of a request. One of the [core philosophies guiding Rocket](https://rocket.rs/guide/introduction/#foreword) is to always be aware of how a request will be handled. In particular, I want to always be able to answer the question: \"What needs to be true for this request to be handled successfully?\" I feel that Rocket presently does a great job of allowing one to answer that question, and I fear that middleware may muddle that clarity.\r\n\r\n> Consider altering the method before the request is handled (eg. X-HTTP-Method-Override or ?_method=); this would need to modify the request.\r\n\r\nI never stated that modifying the request is something Rocket shouldn't allow. In fact, I believe it should, and further, that it's necessary for exactly these cases. I tried to be very explicit in qualifying with _directly_ when I said: \"information should never directly flow from pre-processors to request handlers\". What you've illustrated is an example of _indirect_ information; the request handler has no idea, nor does it need to know, that the request method has been changed.\r\n\r\n> I don't understand your mental model here. Middleware that does this I can agree is badly written and this kind of thing doesn't exist in any framework I've worked with/on.\r\n\r\nJust about every implementation of middleware I've encountered allow this, and most use this feature for many core tasks. For an example, see [Rail's list of default middleware](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_on_rack.html#inspecting-middleware-stack).\r\n\r\n> I'd also argue that the ability to do so is not a property of middleware in general but rather the request or context object used in conjunction.\r\n\r\nThe \"request/context\" object is just about the only means by which pre/post processors function, so I'm a bit confused with this statement. And, again, most middleware implementations _do_ allow you to pass arbitrary information to request handlers. Even the [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.5.x/JavaActionsComposition#passing-objects-from-action-to-controller) allows this!\r\n\r\nPerhaps my clarifications here will allow you to read my original response in a different light. I look forward to any additional use cases you might have.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/274687140/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":933874272,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTMzODc0Mjcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/933874272","actor":{"login":"mehcode","id":753919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzkxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/753919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode","html_url":"https://github.com/mehcode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-24T02:54:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":933874273,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDkzMzg3NDI3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/933874273","actor":{"login":"mehcode","id":753919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzkxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/753919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode","html_url":"https://github.com/mehcode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-24T02:54:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/274690854","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/55#issuecomment-274690854","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/55","id":274690854,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDY5MDg1NA==","user":{"login":"mehcode","id":753919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzkxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/753919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode","html_url":"https://github.com/mehcode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-24T03:22:47Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T03:22:47Z","body":">

I mean.. \r\n\r\n - In Python,  you can use middleware to attach arbitrary information to a request because classes are hash maps — `request.random_data = 20`\r\n - In Node, middleware can also randomly add data because dynamic language\r\n - In Go, middleware normally passes around a https://golang.org/pkg/context/ object that allows `Get/Set` of arbitrary data\r\n\r\nThis is the end of my experience. \r\n\r\nBecause Rust is a static language, middleware can't just add some data  to the Request unless we expose a generic get/set system like Go web frameworks do. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> My main objection to the general idea is that middleware tends to hide the flow of a request. One of the core philosophies guiding Rocket is to always be aware of how a request will be handled. In particular, I want to always be able to answer the question: \"What needs to be true for this request to be handled successfully?\" I feel that Rocket presently does a great job of allowing one to answer that question, and I fear that middleware may muddle that clarity.\r\n\r\nFair enough. You can't just look at a request and understand exactly what a request needs if there is a middleware looking at a header and rejecting the request. \r\n\r\nI don't think we can get around this.. de-centralized flow.. though. We're trying to add some generic bit of code that happens at the start of every single request and, for example, sets a request header. The key bit here is I don't want requests to know about this (eg. profiling) because it needs to be decoupled and perhaps only added during benchmarking, development, or testing.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that the reason you feel this way is that during development of a web service you've encountered the \"why is my request not hitting my handler/route?!\" and spending X hours debugging only to find its a middleware with a typo on the header its checking.\r\n\r\nI'd feel that clear, concise debug logging (which is very possible if we structure the middleware right) of why, when, and where rejections are coming from would go a long way to making this feel more natural.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndebug: request rejected from `CORS` on line 215: \"Request missing an Origin

ody":"@SergioBenitez \r\n\r\nI definitely love the ways the Rocket currently removes the need for middleware, including ManagedState and RequestGuards which are both powerful and effective tools. (There is possible use for a RequestGuard that doesn't provide a value?).\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe case where Rocket's current tool-set doesn't work well for me is \"request/response timing/profiling\" which might then be collected with `rust-metrics` or `prometheus`.\r\n\r\nMy fast and lazy approach to handle metrics was to write code like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#[post(\"/stuff\")]\r\nfn post_stuff() -> Result<Redirect, Failure> {\r\n    let metrics = collect_metrics!(\"post\", \"/stuff\");\r\n\r\n    /*  ... do stuff ... */\r\n  \r\n    metrics.finish(Status::SeeOther);\r\n    return Ok(Redirect::to(&target));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome apparent flaws to this hack include that it doesn't capture render time; it doesn't capture routing time; it has boilerplate that's easy to mistype; and it doesn't behave well with exceptions/panics. \r\n \r\nI'm confident if I spend more time I could mitigate some of those issues by implementing a RequestGuard to start the data collection, a Response wrapper which uses the guard, and possibly codegen to hide the extra boilerplate; however, it would still be an incomplete solution.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nAs an extension to this, if someone wanted to use a tracing system like OpenTracing or Zipkin, there could be a use case for timing (or lifecycle hooks :/ ) in each part of the request lifecycle to be able to track and measure each portion of a single request (maybe data handling, request guards, or forwarding take time or perform complex checks).\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nOverall, I'm advocating against Rails-like Middleware, but am still searching for a good solution to collecting metrics.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/283775976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kestred","id":2653498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTM0OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2653498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kestred","html_url":"https://github.com/kestred","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kestred/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kestred/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kestred/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kestred/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kestred/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kestred/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kestred/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kestred/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kestred/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":984372894,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTg0MzcyODk0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/984372894","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-02T20:50:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":984372896,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDk4NDM3Mjg5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/984372896","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-02T20:50:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-09T02:25:13Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T02:25:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/40","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket","labels_url":"https://api.github.
