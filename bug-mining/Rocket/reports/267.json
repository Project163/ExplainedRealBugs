This makes it not possible to add other layers (e.g. https://github.com/tokio-rs/console) to the application without changing Rocket's source code.\n\n### Ideal Solution\n\nThere should either be a fairing where you can register layers, or the `RocketDynFmt` implementation could be exposed further as a trait you could implement in your application (with suitable defaults for workers, colors, level etc.)\n\n### Why can't this be implemented outside of Rocket?\n\nThe function where the tracing_subscriber is initialized is internal to `RocketDynFmt`.\n\n### Are there workarounds usable today?\n\nOther than modifying the Rocket source, no.\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Checks\n\n- [X] I do not believe that this feature can or should be implemented outside of Rocket.\n- [X] I was unable to find a previous request for this feature.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2840/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
