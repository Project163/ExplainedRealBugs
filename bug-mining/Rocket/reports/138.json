I was not aware of this functionality, as neither [the Guide for mounting](https://rocket.rs/v0.4/guide/overview/#mounting) nor [the API docs for `.mount()`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.4/rocket/struct.Rocket.html#method.mount) mention this.\r\n\r\nIt would be good to provide this documentation and/or examples of it explicitly for those newer to Rust/Rocket, as this would be a vital portion of successfully building web apps with Rocket and would significantly help with the on-boarding process.\r\n\r\nAn example where the route \"/\" serves web pages while \"/api\" is used for API calls would be the most optimal way of demonstrating this functionality.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1458/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
