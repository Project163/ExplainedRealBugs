If the cookie cannot be found, or the cookie fails to authenticate or decrypt, None is returned.\r\n\r\nHowever calling `get_private_pending` after calling `add_private` with the same cookie name, does not return the cookie just added. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[get(\"/\")]\r\nfn handler(jar: &CookieJar<'_>) {\r\n    jar.add_private(Cookie::new(\"name\", \"value\"));\r\n    assert!(jar.get_private_pending(\"name\").is_some());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nI would expect that `get_pending_cookie` would return the pending cookie if there is one, or the original cookie decrypted, or None,\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n - OS Distribution and Kernel: Manjaro Quonos 21.2.1 (Kernel 5.14.21)\r\n - Rocket Version: 0.5.0-rc.1\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\n\r\nFrom looking at the code, I believe this bug is because  `get_private_pending` attempts to decrypt the cookie it found via `get_pending` regardless of if it was a newly added cookie, or one from the request. This is a problem because add_private doesn't actually appear to encrypt the cookie, instead it flags it as private and I assume it is encrypted later on. Due to this, the attempt to decrypt the pending cookie fails and so it appears as if there was no cookie at all.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2063/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2063/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
