There some status codes (such at `NoContent`) for which there is a clear reason why they contain what the do. However, your point about `NotFound` is likely valid. The http spec says that servers 'SHOULD' provide a body to all 4XX status codes, but it's not required. Rocket seems to require a body for 404, but none of the others.\r\n\r\nI think it would be desirable to adjust all 4XX response structs to be the same, but I'm not sure whether we should standardize on Option. Requiring the insertion of `Some()` doesn't increase readability, and could break existing code (although 0.5 is in beta, so this is less of an issue). Standardizing on just wrapping a raw Responder could be ideal, although it technically takes away the ability to send a 4XX without a body using these structs. This could be solved in one of two ways: First, implement Responder for `Option`, which responds with no content when None, second, implement responder for `()`, or finally, `NotFound` (and friends) could take `<O: Into<R>, R: Responder>` as type parameters. I the best option might be to remove the `R: Responder` bound on the status structs, but only apply it to the `Responder` impl. This should allow `NotFound<()>` to also implement Responder, even if `()` doesn't implement Responder.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1258695409/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"the10thWiz","id":16281943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjgxOTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16281943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz","html_url":"https://github.com/the10thWiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1259535288","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2351#issuecomment-1259535288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2351","id":1259535288,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzqMt85LEvu4","user":{"login":"the10thWiz","id":16281943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjgxOTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16281943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz","html_url":"https://github.com/the10thWiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-27T13:46:20Z","updated_at":"2022-09-27T13:46:20Z","body":"After some careful consideration, I believe the best option is to standardize on `Status<R>(pub R)`.
