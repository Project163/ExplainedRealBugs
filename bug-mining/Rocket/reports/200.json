This is problematic to deal with when many `ContentType`s have to be ingested and used in some way. For example:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nif ContentType::Binary == content_type {\r\n    \"bin\"\r\n} else if ContentType::HTML == content_type {\r\n    \"html\"\r\n} else if ContentType::Plain == content_type {\r\n    \"txt\"\r\n} else if ContentType::JSON == content_type {\r\n    \"json\"\r\n} // etc\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat would be nicer is to be able to match:\r\n```rs\r\nmatch content_type {\r\n    ContentType::Binary => \"bin\",\r\n    ContentType::HTML => \"html\",\r\n    ContentType::Plain => \"txt\",\r\n    ContentType::JSON => \"json\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Suggested Changes**\r\n\r\nDeriving `Eq` would allow using `ContentType`s  in a `match` expression.\r\n\r\n**Alternatives Considered**\r\n\r\nA method such as `ContentType::to_extension` would also work for the example outlined here.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\n\r\n[`Eq` requires the equality comparison to be an equivalence relation.](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Eq.html) Since `PartialEq` is derived rather than implemented manually, `ContentType` should satisfy these requirements.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2132/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
