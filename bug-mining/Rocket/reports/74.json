Sometimes this can be handled with request guards\r\nand sometimes this can be handled by co-opting `Result`'s responder behavior, but in a fair amount of cases it'd be convenient to define an `enum` with variants for all of the Responders that are possible and then have `Responder` automatically derived for that enum.\r\n\r\nHere are a few use examples:\r\n\r\n**Different content types:**\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Responder)]\r\nenum MyResponse {\r\n    Json(Json<MyObject>),\r\n    Xml(Xml<MyObject>),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Different objects:**\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Responder)]\r\nenum MyResponse {\r\n    Person(Json<Person>),\r\n    Business(Json<Business>),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Different errors** - This case is especially useful when working with multiple libraries with builtin-support for rocket.\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Responder)]\r\nenum MyError {\r\n    Custom(Json),\r\n    GraphQL(GraphQLError),\r\n    Twirp(TwirpError),\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/590/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
