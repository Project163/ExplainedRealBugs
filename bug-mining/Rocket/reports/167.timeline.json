rocket::http::hyper::header::Location;\r\n\r\n#[derive(Responder)]\r\n#[response(status=303)]\r\nstruct RawRedirect((), Location);\r\n\r\nfn get_redirected() -> RawRedirect {\r\n    RawRedirect((),

Rocket 0.4.0.\r\n2. Mac OS X 10.11 / Ubuntu Server 18\r\n\r\nWhen the browser opens URL like `http://somedomain.com/somepath/somealias?queryparam={curlybraces}` on my Rocket based webserver, I get `400 Bad Request` and `panicked at 'Error: expected EOF but found '{' at index 12'` in it's log.\r\nWhile expecting behavior is to trait `{curlybraces}` as a value for `queryparam`.\r\n\r\nIt's obviously an issue related to URI parser. But wait! An implementation of URI parsing is quiet correct and done right accordingly to RFC!\r\n\r\nLet's look at [RFC 7230, Section 2.7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7) and [RFC 3986, Section 3.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.4) which describes the Query part of URI. \r\n\r\nAccording to RFCs above, query string should contain either `pchar` or \"/\" or \"?\". \r\n`pchar` defined as follows:\r\n```\r\npchar         = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / \":\" / \"@\"\r\npct-encoded   = \"%\" HEXDIG HEXDIG\r\nunreserved    = ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\"\r\nsub-delims    = \"!\" / \"$\" / \"&\" / \"'\" / \"(\" / \")\"\r\n                 / \"*\" / \"+\" / \",\" / \";\" / \"=\"\r\n```\r\nRFCs have no place for '{' and '}' symbols! \r\n\r\nThe common behavior is to trait them as correct ones, as  implemented in modern browsers and webservers. (Try yourself pointing your browser to https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/?name={name} - you will get 404 error, not Bad Request! This means that the parser of URL on the Github's side eats {} well.)\r\n\r\nI have a dirty patch to this issue here: https://github.com/vladignatyev/Rocket/commit/b4660b71f90ec7580d2046fcdf18c11be7169430\r\n(simply added curly braces '{' and '}' into char table, so parser does not fail).\r\n\r\nThe test in the provided commit is not correct, but it showcases an issue. Before patching it will show the annoying `expected EOF but found '{' at index...` message. After patching it will fail with assert (left != right).\r\n\r\nI need your thoughts and ideas!

Background\r\n\r\nRocket 0.4 [introduced Typed URIs](https://rocket.rs/v0.4/news/2018-12-08-version-0.4/#typed-uris) and a new [`Uri` type](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.4/rocket/http/uri/enum.Uri.html). The `uri!` macro and strict `Uri` validation is a valuable addition to Rocket's API and is a great example of Rocket's promise of safety and correctness, but there are a few problems with it due to deficiencies and/or bugs in Rocket and in browsers.\r\n\r\nThis is a summary of the following issues and PRs:\r\n\r\n- [x] #842 - URI References /  `Uri` type does not support anchors.\r\n- [x] #853 - Support for absolute `Uri`s / generate absolute URIs from `uri!()`.\r\n- [x] #880/#882 - matching Url-Escaped Routes/match percent decoded urls\r\n- [x] #924/#941 - Un-encoded curly braces fail to parse/Allow more unencoded characters in query strings\r\n- [x] https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/998#issuecomment-544169526\r\n- #995 - (needs some confirmation/testing) Path segments must be valid UTF-8\r\n\r\n## Bugs\r\n* `Uri` does not appear to support fragments in any URI from\r\n  * Workaround: Servers should only deal with fragments in URIs they generate, and most of those can be done via `format!`.\r\n  * Possible solution: add fragment support, but disallow it or treat it as part of the path/query in incoming URIs \r\n* `Location` uses `Uri` and is therefore too strict about which kinds of URIs it accepts (no relative URI, no fragment)\r\n  * Workaround: Manually set the header as a string.\r\n  * Possible solution: Add support for relative URIs and URIs with fragments to `Location` and/or `Uri`\r\n* `Uri` is strict about characters such as `{` needing to be percent-encoded\r\n  * Several browsers send `{` and other characters unencoded, even when they ought to be encoded.\r\n  * **There is currently no workaround**. If a user enters a `{` or certain other relatively innocent charactesr in a plain HTML form submitted with the GET method, Rocket may refuse to process the request entirely.\r\n  * Possible solution: Allow `{` and some other commonly unencoded characters. Clearly document how this adheres or purposefully does not adhere to the relevant standard and why.\r\n* (unconfirmed) `>` isn't even legal in the HTTP header, according to hyper 0.10? Worth double-checking what's going on here.\r\n* Route matching to the request URI is sensitive to percent encoding (e.g. `$` does not match `%24`).\r\n  * **There is currently no workaround**\r\n  * Possible solution: Follow an algorithm such as the one outlined in RFC 3986 §6 to do normalization when doing route comparison.\r\n\r\n## Requests\r\n* `uri!` only takes a string literal that must parse as an `Origin` as its mount point part.\r\n  * Workaround: Manually paste URI together via `format!`.\r\n  * Feature requested: Support any runtime-provided `Uri` as the mount point\r\n  * Possible solution: Accept any `Into<Uri>` as a mount point. Maybe with a special case - string literals can be checked via `TryInto<Uri>` at compile time and raise an error if they are invalid.\r\n* `uri!` with `Option` query parameters works surprisingly (e.g. https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/827#issuecomment-521585546)\r\n\r\n## What next?\r\n\r\nRecapitulating what I wrote in https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/924#issuecomment-470386375:\r\n\r\nRocket states that it adheres to RFC 7230, which relies on RFC 3986 for many of its URI-related definitions. But strictly adhering to RFC 3986 means that some URLs sent by browsers will be rejected as invalid. WHATWG's URL living standard is intended to replace previous URL standards, but it is still a moving target.\r\n\r\nI think the **first step to take** is to decide if WHATWG's URL living standard is an acceptable specification for Rocket to follow at this time. If it is not suitable, careful and documented deviance from the currently followed specification(s) should be made for the few places that browsers do something different from our expectations.\r\n\r\nThere are approximately three decisions to be made as I see it:\r\n\r\n* What URI/URL standard to follow - RFC 7230 or WHATWG are the only realistic standards I know of at this time\r\n* When and how to decode and normalize; either as URIs come in or as they are compared to routes, and which encoding tables to use\r\n* Extending `Uri` with support for relative URIs and fragments, or loosening the requirements to use `Uri` in places such as `Location`\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, I don't want to review or merge a bunch of PRs that modify URI handling without a clear roadmap for doing so in a holistic way.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI will follow up with my own opinions on some of these choices, but I would like to get a feel for what other users of and contributors to Rocket expect as

The version of Rocket you're using. Ensure it's the latest, if possible.\r\n> 2. What steps you've taken to answer the question yourself.\r\n> 3. What documentation you believe should include an answer to this question.\r\n\r\n1. Rocket version: `0.4.2`\r\n2. I tried what was suggested in #934 with no success. I have tried to use `drop()` everywhere I can but I can't get that to work either.\r\n3. If something's actually wrong or if any documentation should be updated, I think this section should be changed:
