Currently I experience some friction between both Rocket's `db_pool` and `mysql_async`. \r\n\r\n- `mysql_async` provides the  [Queryable](https://github.com/blackbeam/mysql_async/blob/master/src/queryable/mod.rs) trait to abstract over a connection and a transaction. The trait is only implemented for a value, not for a mutable reference.\r\n- `Connection<T>` from `db_pools` only implements `deref` and `deref_mut`.  It's not possible to unwrap it into its inner value.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Changes**\r\n\r\nAdd `into_inner()` to `Connection<T`> so that it's possible to unwrap.\r\n\r\n**Alternatives Considered**\r\n\r\nIt would also be possible change mysql_async's side and to implement the `Queryable` trait for `&mut Conn`. I made a [request](https://github.com/blackbeam/mysql_async/issues/165) for that. This would be more ergonomic for Rocket users, because of `deref` support from the Rust language. However in Toql (my ORM), I have to wrap the connection/transaction to actually call the library methods and I prefer wrapping values to references. \r\n\r\n**Context**\r\nCurrently I have a locally patched version of db_pool and added the function. I could provide you a pull request. I'm testing my ORM and plan to release a beta on `crates.io` once I'm done. Until then I'm looking for an ergonomic Api for users.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1790/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
