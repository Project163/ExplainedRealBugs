am rather confused as to what's being argued here.\r\n\r\nIs it that Rocket shouldn't default `stage` and `prod` environments to port 80? If so, well, okay. It just doesn't really matter. As you suggest, that port will probably be changed. So, if that's the case, why does the default matter? Port `80` is the canonical web server port. That's the only reason it's the default port on `stage`/`prod`. Defaults are fallbacks. Change them to your liking.\r\n\r\nOr is it that the \"built-in notion of [environments] is flawed\" and that \"12factor via environment\" is the \"correct way\" to go? If you feel that way, then feel free to ignore dev/stage/prod and do all your configuration via environment variables. Rocket lets you do that _right now_ with no fuss; everything can be configured via the environment! There's no need for an external library.\r\n\r\nOr is that the error message is \"unfriendly and ambiguous\" when binding fails? I think it's neither. Sure, it doesn't directly tell you that an unprivileged user attempted to bind to an privileged port, but it's not far off from that. I don't think we have enough information to improve the error message. But, if you want to take a crack at improving, please do! I'm all for having the best error messages.\r\n\r\nAll this being said, I do think we can improve configuration in a few of ways. First, it would be nice to remove the arbitrary nature of \"dev\", \"stage\", and \"prod\". Instead, the user should be able to have any arbitrary environments with the exception of reserved ones like \"default\" and \"global\". Second, we should have _one_ set of overridable (#290) defaults. Third, we should be able to read configuration from _any_ file instead of one blessed `Rocket.toml`, and it should be possible to specify the path to that file programmatically or via an environment variable  (#228). And fourth, it would be nice to be able to \"merge\" several configurations together. This would allow, for instance, to have a `default.conf` file with defaults as well as `dev.conf` and `prod.conf` that override any defaults set.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/309655706/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":4,"-1":2,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/309851150","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/317#issuecomment-309851150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/317","id":309851150,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTg1MTE1MA==","user":{"login":"mehcode","id":753919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzkxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/753919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode","html_url":"https://github.com/mehcode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-20T18:43:02Z","updated_at":"2017-06-20T18:43:24Z","body":"> Is it that Rocket shouldn't default stage and prod environments to port 80?\r\n\r\nYes.

Err, not quite true. One can use capabilities in Linux to grant access to port 80 without requiring root. That said, it's not an unusual design to start as root and drop permissions. On Linux, there's quite a lot to do apart from just changing to an unprivileged user, so it's not a great design choice unless you're very clued up. Most of us aren't.\r\n\r\nI agree with your problems with `ROCKET_ENV`. Personally, I find the ability to override  configuration with environment variables as a potential security defect waiting to strike (although I've done it systems I've written, as it's been widely asked for), not least because it makes reproduciblity and isolation hard (and makes it harder still to capture configuration in audit-able source control). *It's also hard to get things right when environment variables contains paths which can contain spaces...* *eg GCC CXX, cough*\r\n\r\nThe most egregious examples recently have been `CDPATH` and the various bash function defects.\r\n\r\nI'd rather we went with @mehcode's ideas. At the very least, let's take production-secrets out of the `.toml` configuration and let them reside someone that won't result in accidentally getting into source control.

By the way port 8000 is at least used by DMI and Shoutcast and maybe more, so that may conflict with other services on your network (though that port is not standardised).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/328370732/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"inta","id":150137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDEzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta","html_url":"https://github.com/inta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/328395554","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/317#issuecomment-328395554","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/317","id":328395554,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODM5NTU1NA==","user":{"login":"jrozner","id":26415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner","html_url":"https://github.com/jrozner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-11T01:53:54Z","updated_at":"2017-09-11T01:53:54Z","body":"@inta fundamentally Apache and Rocket solve very different problems. Do I think Apache should change it's default port? Honestly I don't really care what Apache does at this point. Like I said above, where Apache/nginx make sense is as edge nodes that function as load balancers, reverse proxies, serving static assets, and for hosting PHP because mod_php and fast_cgi are basically how PHP is deployed rather than an app server like Java, Ruby, Python, etc. use. There isn't really a reason to use Rocket to do any of those things because it's feature set doesn't lend itself to solving any of those problems.\r\n\r\nWhen I build webapps now I don't worry about the edge because I don't run my own edge servers. While that's not necessarily true of everyone or even necessarily true of the majority it's the direction the trend has moved and a lot of new development is done. As more people move to the cloud, more and more people deploy their app servers behind a virtual load balancer that's part of the platform they deploy. They stick their static assets in something like an S3 bucket and front it with a CDN. For app servers the use of port 80 or even TCP doesn't matter because they're not being deployed publicly. In the case of many app servers TCP isn't even used in favor of unix domain sockets.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying port 80 is dead or not used for HTTP anymore, far from it. Many apps these days are just not deployed on the edge and so tying them to port 80 by default doesn't make sense. Defaulting to something other than 80 removes the necessity of starting privileged, reduces friction to getting up and running, and is safer by reducing the possibility of some catastrophic flaw where privileges are not dropped correctly which the behavior and implementation of from platform to platform changes drastically.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/328395554/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jrozner","id":26415,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26415?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner","html_url":"https://github.com/jrozner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrozner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1242447547,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTI0MjQ0NzU0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/1242447547","actor":{"login":"inta","id":150137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDEzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta","html_url":"https://github.com/inta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/inta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-11T01:53:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
