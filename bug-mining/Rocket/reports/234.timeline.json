Please feel free to implement the proxy header version as well. Doing so would mean adding another field to the TlsConfig structure for the header name. The field would be of similar type and implementation to the recently added `ip_header` configuration value.

`proxy_secure` that is set internally when it makes sense to do so\r\n* `Request` has a `proxy_proto` and `proxy_secure` method used internally\r\n* `FromRequest` is implemented for `Protocol`\r\n*

maintain one private cookie in our system, we are running our local development environment in normal http, in production everything off course is SSL. In development this cookie is marked as not secure (`.secure(false)`). This worked fine in 0.4, but in 0.5 this seems to be ignored and the cookie is always marked as secure on the browser side.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nAdd a cookie to our request:\r\n```\r\nrequest\r\n  .cookies()\r\n  .add_private(Cookie::build(\"test\",\"1234\").secure(false).into())\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that from what I can tell, the cookie itself is correctly created. It is when it is added as a private cookie, the setting is ignored.\r\n\r\nCould be related/caused by https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2425 ?\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nI'm expecting the cookie to not be marked secure.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n - OS Distribution and Kernel: macOS 10.14.6\r\n - Rocket Version: 0.5.0 rc4 (will test on 0.5.0 stable)\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\n\r\nThis for us is only an issue in development as we're not running SSL certificates when developing as everything is kept local to a development machine. We can probably work around this, but it does seem like undefined behaviour that the setting is being ignored.\r\n\r\nIf `add_private` now overrides this setting, possibly the internals of cookie can be changed so `secure` is internally defined as an `Option<Bool>`. Outwardly `secure` and `set_secure` can work as they are but internally this variable defaults to `None`. Setting it just wraps it in a `Some`, getting it does a `unwrap_or(default_secure)`, where `default_secure` by standard is false, but `add_private` sets it to true.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2663/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14872459897,"node_id":"ATPVTE_lADOAzqMt85ZCX--zwAAAAN2d7p5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/14872459897","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"added_to_project_v2","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-12T21:27:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15086350772,"node_id":"PVTISC_lADOAzqMt85ZCX--zwAAAAODN3G0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/15086350772","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"project_v2_item_status_changed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-12T21:28:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14866714370,"node_id":"RFPVTE_lADOAzqMt85ZCX--zwAAAAN2IA8C","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/14866714370","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"removed_from_project_v2","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-12T21:41:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11603836872,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzqMt85ZCX--zwAAAAKzpH_I","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/11603836872","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":
