#881.\r\n\r\nBrief explanation:\r\n\r\n* For forms, a field named `r#type` without a `#[form(name=\"something\")]` will now match `&type=` in an input string, when it currently matches `&r#type=`. This test currently passes in `master`:\r\n    ```rust\r\n    #[derive(Debug, PartialEq, FromForm)]\r\n   struct Hazard { r#type: String, }\r\n\r\n    #[test]\r\n    fn test_hazard() {\r\n        let form: Result<Hazard, _> = strict(\"r#type=test\");\r\n        assert_eq!(form, Ok(Hazard { r#type: \"test\".into() }));\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* For routes, two things happen:\r\n  * Prefixing is always done to an `unraw`ed ident. This is implemented in `prefix()` itself.\r\n  * Comparison of route segment names (e.g. \"<enum>\") is done against the `unraw`ed idents instead of the original idents.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n* [x] Use `unraw` from syn (dtolnay/syn#625) once it's in a release, instead of implementing it here\r\n* [x] rebase on top of latest `master` and update for 1.0 releases of proc_macro2 and syn\n* [x] Unconditionally call `unraw()` in `prefix()` instead\r\n* [x] Explore interactions when using a raw ident in one place and a normal ident in another. In particular, there is some tricky behavior with the `uri!` macro that might be more likely to show up when mixing 2015 code (think `async: bool`) with 2018 code (passing in `r#async: true` to `uri!`).\r\n* [x] Comprehensive reform of handling raw identifiers (see
