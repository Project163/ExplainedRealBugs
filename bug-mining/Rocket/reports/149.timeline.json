Neither of which is very nice for productivity.\r\n\r\nYou could of course choose use uuid::Uuid in the struct instance to serialize, but then you'd need another DTO struct with rocket_contrib::uuid::Uuid to use for any incoming struct (as the entire point of using rocket_contrib::uuid::Uuid is to get implementations for Rocket's FromParam and FromFormValue). By implementing Serialize for rocket_contrib::uuid::Uuid you could skip this step and instead always use rocket_contrib::uuid::Uuid across your entire Rocket codebase.\r\n\r\nWhile it's absolutely true that Serde adds a lot of code, surely the majority of users are going to use Serde, and Rocket's philosophy seems to be more aligned with increasing productivity and having sane, somewhat opionated defaults rather than being ultra-lightweight.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/708011976/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Ran4","id":5494821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTQ4MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5494821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ran4","html_url":"https://github.com/Ran4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ran4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ran4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ran4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ran4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ran4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ran4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ran4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ran4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ran4/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/790531866","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1370#issuecomment-790531866","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1370","id":790531866,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc5MDUzMTg2Ng==","user":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-04T11:04:47Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T11:04:47Z","body":"I'm
