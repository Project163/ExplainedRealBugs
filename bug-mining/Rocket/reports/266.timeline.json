Though, I'm curious, what's your motivation behind 2? \r\n\r\nI really like 5, but I'm concerned how that would be achieved. The most aesthetically pleasing would be to have logs associated with each request grouped together into a block; The simplest implementation of that—off the top of my head—would be to buffer the logs and dump them at the end of each request. Unfortunately, that wouldn't work well for debugging, as presumably you'd want to see logs leading to, for example, an incomplete request due to a panic. \r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to just prefix log lines with a request identifier, but that's not the most \"pretty\" of options. Perhaps these two could be used in combination with point 4, using the former for \"non-compact\", and the latter as a \"compact\" debug option, assuming I'm understanding the implication of \"compact\" correctly. \r\n\r\nDo any of Rust's current log options meet point 6?

My idea to make it work is to use https://github.com/slog-rs/term but submit a PR to slog-term that would allow us to define a \"format method\" to format the structured record. This way we can shove a big bunch of data that I would love and would expose via slog-json in production
