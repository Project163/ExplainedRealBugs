a closer look, this is not quite a bug, but it is really unfortunate.\r\n\r\nPreviously, when we wrote `mount(\"/foo\", routes![index])`, where `index.uri = \"/\"`, Rocket would route requests to `/foo` to `index`. This is inconsistent with the changes in https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/commit/51ed332127df2737a7d1c1a22a1e13379ea5f6d5, where the expected behavior would be for this combination of mount point (`/foo`) and route URI (`/`) to accept requests to `/foo/` and _not_ `/foo`. But this would result in breaking applications that expected the previous behavior.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to \"protect\" against breaking applications that expect such a mount point/route URI combination to react as before by specifically checking for this case and \"fixing\" it automatically:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/blob/6ab85b6643289016be5e7905ad5c1fa44e9ce2d6/core/lib/src/route/uri.rs#L123-L130\r\n\r\nBut this results in the issue laid out here, where we strip the trailing slash when it's not intended.\r\n\r\nThe ambiguity is present only when the route URI is `/` and the mount point is non-empty, as in this example. The question becomes whether the effective route URI should be `/base/` or `/base`:\r\n  * `mount(\"/base\", \"/\")` => `/base` OR `/base/`\r\n\r\nA related concern, and perhaps a way to resolve this issue, is whether a trailing path in the mount point is meaningful. Up to and including now, a trailing slash in a mount point has no meaning. That is:\r\n\r\n * ∀ B, R. `mount(B, R)` `==` `mount(B/, R)`\r\n\r\nBut one way to remove the need to choose between  `mount(\"/base\", \"/\")` resolving as either `/base` OR `/base/` is to say that it resolves to the former always, and that resolving to the latter would require `mount(\"/base/\", \"/')`. This has the advantage of probably keeping existing code working. I say _probably_ because we've  still changed the meaning of `mount(\"/base/\", \"/\")`, which would previously also resolve to `/base`. This has the disadvantages that it 1) introduces a special case, 2) is probably pretty confusing, 3) isn't consistent with the intention behind https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/commit/51ed332127df2737a7d1c1a22a1e13379ea5f6d5, and 4) still doesn't keep all previous applications working, as mentioned.\r\n\r\nSo I'm inclined to say that we simply bite the bullet fully and commit to the breaking change. That is, `mount(\"/base\", \"/\")` resolves to `/base/` _always_, and we continue to provide that ∀ B, R. `mount(B, R)` `==` `mount(B/, R)`.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1532328902/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1533525815","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2533#issuecomment-1533525815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2533","id":1533525815,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzqMt85bZ783","user":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-03T18:41:08Z","updated_at":"2023-05-03T18:44:45Z","body":"After further consideration, perhaps we _should_ distinguish between mount points of `/foo` and `/foo/`.\r\n\r\nConsider a resource `user` using a typical REST architecture. One such API might look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /user            - add new user\r\nGET  /user/<id>       - get a user with ID `id`\r\n```\r\n\r\nWriting such an API in Rocket today looks like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nmod user {\r\n    #[post(\"/\")] fn add() -> Result<User> { .. }\r\n    #[get(\"/<id>\")] fn get() -> User { .. }\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[launch]\r\nfn rocket() -> _ {\r\n    rocket::build().mount(\"/user\", routes![user::add, user::get])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut with the proposed changes in my comment above, the effective routes would be:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- POST /user            - add new user\r\n+ POST /user/           - add new user\r\nGET  /user/<id>       - get a user with ID `id`\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich doesn't match the desired API. To get the desired behavior, we would need to declare the `add` route as having a URI of `/user` and mount it at `\"/\"`, which breaks the desired modularity and makes the program less composable. Of course, there's nothing wrong with `POST /user/`, but it seems odd that Rocket would make it impossible to have `POST /user` without succumbing to writing more code and making the program harder to modularize/compose. By a similar token, it seems odd to disallow `POST /user/` entirely as well.\r\n\r\nSo it seems we _do_ want to give the ultimate choice to the user, and one simple way to do that is to use the mount point as the distinguisher.

The issue here is what effect mount points should have on the effective URI of routes with a path of `/`.
