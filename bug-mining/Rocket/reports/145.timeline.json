I can confirm this is a soundness issue that remains present in 0.5. I am working on a fix now.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this bug is minimal at worst. We already advise users to `#[derive(UriDisplay)]`, so custom implementations of `UriDisplay` are unlikely, which are necessary to trigger this issue. Furthermore, a `panic!()`, direct or indirect, is unlikely to appear in a `UriDisplay` implementation, considering its purpose. Thus, the chance for an issue to arise as a result is minimal.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the implementation is incorrect. I will be rolling out a fix in a new release immediately.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/776352465/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4312320703,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDMxMjMyMDcwMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/4312320703","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"e325e2fce4d9f9f392761e9fb58b418a48cef8bb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/commits/e325e2fce4d9f9f392761e9fb58b418a48cef8bb","created_at":"2021-02-10T01:27:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/776393486","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1534#issuecomment-776393486","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1534","id":776393486,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NjM5MzQ4Ng==","user":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-10T02:27:12Z","updated_at":"2021-02-10T02:27:12Z","body":"Rocket

for the quick fix! Would you mind requesting an unsound advisory to [RustSec advisory database](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db) about this bug? An unsound advisory is used to represent a bug that has security implications but unlikely to be triggered in normal cases (like this one) and surfaces as a warning instead of an error in security auditing tools. We usually file RustSec advisory request by ourselves for minor crates, but it would be great if it can be written by someone who has more domain knowledge about how the crate is used in this case. An advisory can be marked as an unsound advisory with `informational = \"unsound\"` line in the `[advisory]` metadata section (it is currently not documented in the advisory example in README).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/776417105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Qwaz","id":5073807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzM4MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5073807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qwaz","html_url":"https://github.com/Qwaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qwaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qwaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qwaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qwaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qwaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qwaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qwaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qwaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qwaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4317685156,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQzMTc2ODUxNTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/4317685156","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b53a906a8e170fe9b151381c66a76a872c419f9e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/commits/b53a906a8e170fe9b151381c66a76a872c419f9e","created_at":"2021-02-11T00:51:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ammaraskar","id":773529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzUyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammaraskar","html_url":"https://github.com/ammaraskar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammaraskar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammaraskar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammaraskar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammaraskar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammaraskar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammaraskar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammaraskar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammaraskar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ammaraskar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-26T06:57:10Z","updated_at":"2021-03-26T06:57:10Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rustsec/advisory-db/issues/834","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rustsec/advisory-db","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rustsec/advisory-db/issues/834/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rustsec/advisory-db/issues/834/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rustsec/advisory-db/issues/834/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/pull/834","id":841651684,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjAxMzU3MDkw","number":834,"title":"[patched]
