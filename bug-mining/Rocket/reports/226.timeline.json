Which is correct from an HTTP point of view, since the response code/status is not a header: \r\n\r\n> HTTP headers consists of its case-insensitive name followed by a colon (:), then by its value. ([source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers))\r\n\r\nSo if you do \r\n\r\n    #[derive(rocket::Responder)]\r\n    struct ServerError {\r\n        status: Status,\r\n    }\r\nit will compile but `Status` doesn't have a body, which you wanted.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo maybe help solving your practical problem at hand:\r\n\r\nSo you could either build your response dynamically with `Response::build::...`. \r\n_Or_, as the [stated in the Responder trait docs](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/response/trait.Responder.html#implementation-tips) at the 3rd point it is advised\r\n> You should avoid varying responses based on the Request value as much as possible\r\nwhich, in combination with the `enum` example above, I would interpret as \"make a type for each kind of answer\". Since your type here is `ServerError` it would indeed by weird if one could return a `ServerError` response with `Status = 200` or something like that. So if you want to return different server errors, you could create an enum with all the cases that you actually want:\r\n\r\n    #[derive(rocket::Responder)]\r\n    enum ServerError {\r\n        #[response(status = 500)]\r\n        InternalServerError(String),\r\n        #[response(status = 503)]\r\n        ServiceUnavailable(String, RetryAfter),\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    struct RetryAfter(u32);\r\n    \r\n    impl From<RetryAfter> for Header<'static> {\r\n        #[inline(always)]\r\n        fn from(RetryAfter(retry_after): RetryAfter) -> Self {\r\n            Header::new(\"Retry-After\", retry_after.to_string())\r\n        }\r\n    }","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1484108083/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"freelon","id":2052561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTI1NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2052561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/freelon","html_url":"https://github.com/freelon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freelon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freelon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freelon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freelon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freelon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freelon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freelon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freelon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freelon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1484293232","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2484#issuecomment-1484293232","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2484","id":1484293232,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzqMt85YeIRw","user":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-27T00:27:13Z","updated_at":"2023-03-27T00:27:13Z","body":"Yes, this is indeed a bug in the docs! `Status` is not a header.
