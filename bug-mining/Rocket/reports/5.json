Aside from the obvious address and port, Rocket also requires:\n- Logging level. (If no env variable, I suppose.)\n- Session private key.\n- Default headers, if desired.\n\nIt would be nice to split this into a separate file, too, so that changing configuration doesn't require a recompilation of the application. The file could contain a different key for each environment. Something like:\n\n```\n[dev]\nlog = debug\n\n[stage]\naddress = \"12.1.2.1\"\nport = 80\nsession_key = \"MgbWFkZSISBVc...\"\n\n[prod]\naddress = \"72.14.0.1\"\nport = 80\nlog = critical\nsession_key = \"MgbWFkZSBmb3IgWW91ISBVc...\"\nheaders = [\"x-xss-protection: 1; mode=block\", \"x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN\"]\n```\n\nEach environment should have sane default. You shouldn't need a config file at all to develop.\n\nThe `hello_world` main function could then look like:\n\n```\nRocket::mount_and_launch(\"/hello\", routes![hello]);\n```\n\nRocket would then use the environment declared in a `ROCKET_ENV` environment variable, or `dev` by default. So, for example, in production, the binary could be run as:\n\n```\nROCKET_ENV=prod ./hello_world\n```\n\nIt would be neat if Rocket checks if the binary was compiled whether the binary was compiled in `release` or `debug` mode and warn if a `debug` build is being used in production or if a `release` build is being used during development. `stage` should probably have no checks.\n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/11/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/11/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
