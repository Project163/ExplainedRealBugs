A normal user can't test their app configuration via `ROCKET_ENV=prod cargo run` because they can't bind to the privileged port.  I understand it's trivial to change the port via `ROCKET_PORT`, but why should this be necessary when running Rocket on port 80 is uncommon (except maybe in a Docker container).  I think most deployments would be behind something like nginx/varnish which themselves would be bound on port 80.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ROCKET_ENV=prod rustup run nightly cargo run\r\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs\r\n     Running `/Users/benw/Projects/rocket/target/debug/hello_world`\r\nWarning: environment is 'production', but no `secret_key` is configured\r\nError: Rocket failed to launch due to an I/O error.\r\nthread 'main' panicked at 'Permission denied (os error 13)', /Users/benw/Projects/rocket/lib/src/error.rs:204\r\nnote: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's also unfriendly and ambiguous why Rocket `thread 'main' panicked at 'Permission denied (os error 13)',` unless you know that it's because you can't bind to port 80.  Wouldn't it be more appropriate to just have standard rocket port (`8000`) for all the envs?  And then change to the uncommon port 80 as needed.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/317/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/317/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
