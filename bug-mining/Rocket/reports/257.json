Being able to run dual HTTP3/QUIC would be a great feature for performance, particularly in network-unstable environments.\n\n### Ideal Solution\n\nI would recommend something similar to what NGINX does - send the Alt-Svc header for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 requests, take PORTNUM/tcp as HTTP/1.1/2 and PORTNUM/udp as HTTP/3/QUIC. To integrate directly via Hyper, the solutions being worked on at https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1818 could be helpful.\n\n### Why can't this be implemented outside of Rocket?\n\nCurrently I reverse proxy all my services, which does let me use QUIC between clients and the reverse proxy. However, that does not work when people are running Rocket directly without a reverse proxy.\n\n### Are there workarounds usable today?\n\nThere's the previously mentioned reverse proxy solution, but that is not in-Rocket.\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Checks\n\n- [X] I do not believe that this feature can or should be implemented outside of Rocket.\n- [X] I was unable to find a previous request for this feature.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2723/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2723/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
