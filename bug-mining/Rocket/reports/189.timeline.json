This problem is not relevant for all engines, but might affect a few more besides `mysql_async`:\r\n\r\n* The equivalent `sqlx` methods take an `E: Executor`, which is implemented for references to connections or transactions, and therefore doesn't have this problem\r\n* The equivalent `diesel` methods (not relevant, but for comparison's sake) take an `&Connection`, and wouldn't have this problem\r\n* `tokio-postgres` has a similar trait, `GenericClient`, which may have the same problem\r\n* `redis` has a similar trait, `ConnectionLike`, which may have the same problem\r\n\r\nThere are a few different kinds of solutions here:\r\n\r\n* Your APIs might be able to use e.g. `&mut X where X: Queryable` instead, similarly to `diesel`. This may not be as ergonomic as the other approaches, but it should be doable without modifying either `rocket` or `mysql_async`\r\n* `mysql_async` could implement `Queryable for &mut Q where Q: Queryable`, along the same lines as traits such as `std::io::{Read,Write}`, `serde::{Serialize,Deserialize}` which make use cases including this one more ergonomic\r\n* `rocket_db_pools` could add an `into_inner()` method. I actually don't see any immediate problems with doing this today; my only hesitation is that it would not play nicely with an `impl Drop for Connection` should we want to add one in the future. I don't expect that we would need that, so in my eyes this is probably worth doing.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/890031056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5210393528,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDUyMTAzOTM1Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/5210393528","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-26T03:49:11Z","milestone":{"title":"0.5.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5225550194,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTIyNTU1MDE5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/5225550194","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"8cae077ba1d54b92cdef3e171a730b819d5eeb8e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/commits/8cae077ba1d54b92cdef3e171a730b819d5eeb8e","created_at":"2021-08-30T11:07:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5939185434,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzqMt8445V2TzwAAAAFiAMca","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/5939185434","actor":{"login":"ThouCheese","id":20339680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzM5Njgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20339680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThouCheese","html_url":"https://github.com/ThouCheese","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThouCheese/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThouCheese/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThouCheese/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThouCheese/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThouCheese/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThouCheese/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThouCheese/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThouCheese/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThouCheese/received_events","type":"User","user_vi
