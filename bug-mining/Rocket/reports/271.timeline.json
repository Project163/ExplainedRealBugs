It seems rare that one needs this feature, and when it is needed it's so one-off, and the work-arounds easy-enough, that it outweighs the complexity to implement the feature. \n\nI should note that there is no performance impact caused by the work-around beyond creating the multiple routes. The router indexes by method, so there's no additional cost when the application is running.\n\nAs to actually doing this, I'm not opposed to the idea, but we'd need a way for Rocket to continue to statically check that only payload-bearing methods are allowed to have a `data` component. The most elegant approach would probably be to allow a `data` attribute _iff_ all of the methods in the set support a payload. That might work.

Ideally whatever implementation we choose here wouldn't need to be rethought to support non-standard methods.\r\n\r\nYes, I’ve seen this issue. Unfortunately, I don’t see how this can be made to work with `enumset`. So it’s either `Any` as a special wildcard “method” (and no arbitrary combinations of methods) or making the `method` field a `HashSet<String>`. The latter would require more significant code changes and have some impact on memory usage. Whether it is worth it depends on whether you consider combinations like GET | POST worth implementing – they aren’t necessary for my use case.\r\n\r\nI’d also have to take a closer look at routing, if you say that it is indexed by method then I apparently missed something. There is the question of how it can process the scenario where matching routes exist for both the specific method and “any.” Should it always take the route for the specific method? Or maybe go by rank, so that there can be a “default” GET route invoked when everything else fails?\r\n\r\n> The most elegant approach would probably be to allow a data attribute *iff* all of the methods in the set support a payload.\r\n\r\nI’d rather say: iff *any* of the methods in the set support a payload. Proxying and internal redirects generally need to forward data if present, while supporting whatever methods there could be. Yes, weaker static guarantees in this case.\r\n\r\nFun fact: I did encounter web applications using GET requests with a payload.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1953601392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"palant","id":374261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDI2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/374261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant","html_url":"https://github.com/palant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1957851115","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2731#issuecomment-1957851115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2731","id":1957851115,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzqMt850sm_r","user":{"login":"palant","id":374261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDI2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/374261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant","html_url":"https://github.com/palant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-21T20:27:26Z","updated_at":"2024-02-21T21:54:01Z","body":"I found `Router::route` method which I missed before, this one will have to be adjusted as well.

API Docs to Existing Functionality\n\nhttps://rocket.rs/guide/v0.5/requests/#error-catchers\n\n### Problems with Existing Functionality\n\nCurrently, rocket logs a message at level `ERROR` whenever no route matches:\n\n```\n2025-06-30T17:05:42.542694Z ERROR rocket::server::_: No matching routes for ESC[32mGETESC[0m ESC[34m/.idea/workspace.xmlESC[0m.    \n2025-06-30T17:05:42.542766Z  WARN rocket::server::_: No ESC[1;34m404ESC[0m catcher registered. Using Rocket default.    \n```\n\nOr with a default error catcher installed:\n\n```\n2025-07-23T13:33:49.967921Z ERROR rocket::server::_: No matching routes for GET /no-such-document.    \n2025-07-23T13:33:49.968089Z  WARN rocket::server::_: Responding with registered (error_handler) default catcher.    \n```\n\nFor a webserver facing the public internet, probes for nonexistent paths are normal.  They should not generate high-severity log messages.\n\nThis is operationally important, because the webserver's ERROR, WARN and INFO logs will otherwise be swamped with useless information.  On systems with space-based log rotation, this can cause important messages about actual misconfigurations to be quickly lost; on systems with time-based log rotation, it could fill up the disk and break the service.\n\nThis definitely applies to 404 errors but it may apply to others too.\n\n\n### Suggested Changes\n\nI suggest the following changes:\n\n * The \"No matching routes\" message ought to be at level `DEBUG` or `TRACE`.\n * The \"Responding with registered ... default catcher\" message should be at leavel `TRACE`.  The error catcher can log at a higher severity if it wishes.\n\n### Alternatives Considered\n\nMy application could try to install a default route but it ought to apply to all methods but there is no way to make an \"all-methods\" route (#2731).  And this issue doesn't seem application-specific.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nI didn't find any documentation about what happens when no route matches.\n\n### System Checks\n\n- [x] I do not believe that this suggestion can or should be implemented outside of Rocket.\n\n- [x] I was unable to find a previous suggestion for this change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2951/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2951/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
