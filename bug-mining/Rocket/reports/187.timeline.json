Importantly, I think it's not yet possible after all to set up a pool \"the manual way\" because some of Rocket's traits--such as `FromRequest`--are still synchronous.\r\n\r\n* We will want to keep the existing support for synchronous databases, simply because I doubt the entire database ecosystem will become async in time. We may need to create two sets of database macros and traits (e.g. `AsyncPoolable` and `#[async_database]` or `#[database(async)]`)\r\n* `bb8` is the async equivalent of `r2d2`. The latest release uses `tokio-timer 0.2`, which may make it incompatible with the more recent `tokio` runtime that Rocket's `async` branch uses. khuey/bb8#31 is the tracking issue for using the `async`-compatible `Future` and `tokio` versions.\r\n* Asynchronous pool initialization and initial connections. To do this asynchronously, `Fairing::on_launch` would need to become asynchronous and be run after starting the runtime (it is currently done synchronously before the runtime exists). Changing this is going to be relatively difficult.\r\n* Asynchronous connection acquisition. This would require `FromRequest` to become asynchronous, or perhaps a new trait such as `AsyncFromRequest` and blanket impl one for the other.\r\n\r\nSome of these are more general changes than just databases that we will want to do anyway to support other use cases.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/528208277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2609329200,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI2MDkzMjkyMDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/2609329200","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-05T05:50:47Z","label":{"name":"request","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-05T05:53:13Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T05:53:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1065","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1065/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1065/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1065/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1065","id":475950747,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzU5NTA3NDc=","number":1065,"title":"Tracking

Routes that do not `await` anything can remain unchanged. `#[catch]`ers can also be defined as an `async fn`.\r\n  * Methods on `Data` now return `Future`s that must be `.await`ed. As a consequence, any route that uses `Data` directly must be `async`. Routes that use data guards such as `Json` are not affected by this change.\r\n  * Routes that make their own network requests or other I/O should be `async`, as it will allow other requests to continue while waiting for the operation.\r\n* Mid and low-level APIs (`FromTransformedData` and `FromData`, `Fairing`, `Responder`)\r\n  * Several traits are now defined using `async-trait`, re-exported as `#[rocket::async_trait]`.\r\n  * Data is read asynchronously: `DataStream` implements `tokio::io::AsyncRead` instead of `Read`. Thus, `FromTransformedData::transform` and `From(Transformed)Data::from_data` are `async fn` or return `Future`s.\r\n  * Response bodies are streamed to the client asynchronously: `set_body` and related methods expect `tokio::io::AsyncRead` instead of `Read`.\r\n    * Consequently, `Fairing::on_response` and `Responder::respond_to` are now `async fn`. This allows Responders and Fairings to access and/or replace the body data.\r\n* The testing APIs have been moved to `rocket::local::asynchronous` and `rocket::local::blocking`. The `blocking` test API is simpler to use, and recommended when possible.\r\n* `#[rocket::main]`, `#[rocket::launch]`, and `#[rocket::async_test]` have been added to make `async fn` easily accessible for `main()` and `test()`.\r\n* Many long-standing bugs with keep-alive, graceful shutdown (#180), performance, and more are fixed or will be easier to fix by using actively-supported versions of libraries.\r\n* Some new functionality will be possible to implement, such as SSE and WebSockets. These will likely not make it into Rocket 0.5. At this point, Rocket should not be missing any APIs necessary to implement SSE \"by hand\". WebSockets is a bit more complicated, and tracked in #90 .\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1065/reactions","total_count":340,"+1":170,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":54,"confused":0,"heart":51,"rocket":55,"eyes":10},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1065/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/541363725","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1117#issuecomment-541363725","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1117","id":541363725,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MTM2MzcyNQ==","user":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-12T21:41:18Z","updated_at":"2019-10-12T21:41:18Z","body":"> * We will want to keep the existing support for synchronous databases\r\n\r\nThis might turn out to be pretty tricky.

However, some of the documentation needs some work - in particular, it's unclear what a correct implementation of `recycle()` should actually do.\r\n* `tang` looks like about the same kind of API as `tokio-resource-pool`\r\n\r\n`bb8`'s API may end up being the most straightforward for manually created connection pools, because it's easier to implement `bb8::ManageConnection` than `tokio_resource_pool::Manage`. `tokio-resource-pool` shows the most promise right now for an API using request guards for connections.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/544783861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/545226565","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1117#issuecomment-545226565","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1117","id":545226565,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NTIyNjU2NQ==","user":{"login":"githubaccount624","id":20170894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTcwODk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20170894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/githubaccount624","html_url":"https://github.com/githubaccount624","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githubaccount624/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githubaccount624/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githubaccount624/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githubaccount624/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githubaccount624/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githubaccount624/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githubaccount624/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githubaccount624/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/githubaccount624/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-23T01:45:51Z","updated_at":"2019-10-23T01:45:51Z","body":"@fakeshadow Hi your library looks very well-developed!
