I looking on how to use database in Rocket and the examples/databases has nice example there\r\n\r\nThe problem is there is lack of documentation or guidance on how to getting started working on database. The api documentation currently doesnt explain on how to install in there. Well, so i think i should look further on diesel how to install database sqlite3\r\n\r\nBut, when I want to 'cargo run'. The error show this `/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lsqlite3`. This error for the new people like me doesnt understand this. I found on search where the site explain I doesnt has sqlite3 so I need to install it. I do the sudo apt install sqlite3 and doesnt work. I get confused on what is wrong and turns out I need to install libsqlite3-dev and that cause the 'cargo run' to work\r\n\r\nIf may, please add readme on examples/database. So anyone that is new in development are given proper introduction on how to getting started with database and rocket. Some expalanation like 'you dont has sqlite3 or the library `libsqlite3-dev` installed. That cause the error \"cannot find -lsqlite3\" to happend\"\r\n\r\nThank you. Sorry if kinda long and wordy. I doesnt know how to explain except that haha","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
