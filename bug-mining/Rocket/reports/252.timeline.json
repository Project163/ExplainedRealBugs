You can technically set a negative rank when creating a [route manually](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/struct.Route.html#method.ranked), but you can only set a positive rank when doing so via the attribute. This is by intention. The goal is to avoid confusing the developer by having Rocket assign ranks that the user can also assign.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I agree that the wording could be improved.
