Still, it's nice to define an API as using the proper verb when possible. Use the well-known trick of adding a hidden form field with a known name and an http verb as a value. The field name should likely be '_method'. The value should be one of: \"put\", \"delete\", \"patch\". \n\nRocket should check for this field and use it when routing. A caveat is that Rocket may have to read the entire request to do this, which is slow and time consuming. A work around for this is to demand that _method be the first form value if it appears. Thankfully, the HTTP spec guarantees that the order in the request will match that in the form. Then, at worst, Rocket reads 8 bytes (_method=) more than it had to. Further, Rocket should only check when the request is POST of content type \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\". It's unclear if \"multipart/form-data\" should be handled as well.\n\nUnanswered: should this be optional? Should users be able to opt out of this feature? It seems like the upside is large and the downside is minimal, so it may make most sense to have this be a forced default. \n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/12/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/12/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
