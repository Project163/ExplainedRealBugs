And I saw a recent commit 16cb7297abeef which mentions a breaking change to this setting.\r\n\r\nOver time, I expect Rocket will require a secret key for many other things besides just sessions. For example, Django has a single [`SECRET_KEY` setting](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECRET_KEY), which is used for various purposes, here is a list: http://stackoverflow.com/a/15383766\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that for future-proofing, Rocket use a single `secret_key` config and derive all other keys from just this one config. A user should generate this key once for each deployment and that's it.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
