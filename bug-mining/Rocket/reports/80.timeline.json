The easy way will be just create a new directory inside of `contrib` call it `database` and put there multiple files for every database which we want to implement like `postgres.rs`, `diesel.rs` etc. Then wrap it in `state::Storage` and I guess implement all the things which we need for it like `FromRequest` and etc.\r\n\r\nFor the hard way we will need to implement a structure which will wrap any type of connection, like `struct Database<C>` which will accept any connection manager which implement `ManageConnection` and it will hold all information we need and `PooledConnnection` inside of it. \r\n\r\nThen we need to think about our global state, which will create our global pool, so I guess it will like a helper function which will accept `Config<C, Error>` and connection url, and return our pool. Not sure how it will be done with state, but I guess `Storage<Pool<C>>` and we will work from it. \r\n\r\nImplement checks on it if something wrong and then just use it. Then we will implement `FromRequest` on our `Database` struct and return any type of `connection` we will need, and then we will pass it in request guards, and just `Database::connection` will give us needed one, so the user will use some. Even better will be if we implement our own wrapper for connection so user can use it and don't thing about writing like:\r\n```\r\npub fn create(connection: &PgConnection, username: &str)\r\n```\r\nAnd it will be:\r\n```\r\npub fn create(connection: &OurWrapper, username: &str)\r\n```\r\n`OurWrapper` will basically will work with any type of connection. And then when a user will implement an API he will just use `Database::connection` which will return a reference on `OurWrapper` which will be a connection to a database, with some other safety checks.\r\n\r\nSo about `Rocket.toml`, I guess we will use like `[development.database]`, where we will have a `type` (which will give us a needed connection through deserialization with enum), `url` (which we will use inside of our `r2d2::Config`, like `pool_size` maybe and something else.\r\n\r\nWith the first one it will be not hard to use all of those `cfg` things and we will not pull everything out, it will be less painful to implement it and much safer, but it will generate a little bit more code and at least our connections will not collide and we will know that we use `diesel` and `diesel` macros. And I guess second way of doing it really will make no sense with different types of connections it will only be more confusing.\r\n\r\nWe still could implement a wrapper for every database type, like I said like `MysqlDatabase` which will return reference on `MysqlConnection` and same for others. With Diesel the problem is that we have a two of them but it's not so hard to work it out. And like @SergioBenitez said, we don't really want to compile everything, because a user will decide which database he will use with which features, will it be diesel with postgres or sqlite, or just postgres or just mysql. And with such modular thing it will make more sense for him too when he will see that he uses a `MysqlDatabase` or a `DieselDatabase`.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/277349846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"impowski","id":6883168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODMxNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6883168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/impowski","html_url":"https://github.com/impowski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impowski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impowski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impowski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impowski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impowski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impowski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impowski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impowski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/impowski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":948634231,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTQ4NjM0MjMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/948634231","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-03T20:11:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":948634232,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDk0ODYzNDIzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/948634232","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-03T20:11:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/277360556","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/167#issuecomment-277360556","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/167","id":277360556,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzM2MDU1Ng==","user":{"login":"mehcode","id":753919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MzkxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/753919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode","html_url":"https://github.com/mehcode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mehcode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-

working on an API right now using rocket where we not only need connections to multiple databases but connections to multiple 3rd party REST APIs.  Each of these APIs needs to have configuration and some need persistent connections (connection pooling). I think that designing around the case of a single database connection is not the right way to go.  Even if you use just one database, what if you have sharded connections?  \r\n\r\nIf it's going to be included into the library it should consider multiple connections from the start.  From my very limited knowledge I think you could just write a macro that would instantiate a state container which could then be passed to the `manage()` function.  \r\n\r\nI think something like the following would be the very ergonomic:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n\r\n// A very trivialized and contrived example.\r\nstruct MyCustomPool {\r\n  foo: String,\r\n  bar: String,\r\n  thing: Option<String>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl MyCustomPool {\r\n    pub fn init(f: String, b: String, t: Option<String>) -> Result<MyCustomPool, Error> {\r\n        Ok(MyCustomPool { foo: f, bar: b, thing: t })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl PoolState for MyCustomPool {\r\n    fn retrieve(&self) -> Result<&FooConnection, Error> {\r\n        Ok(&self)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconn1 = rocket_contrib::mysql::Connection::init(\"usa.mysql\",  1234, \"user\", None);\r\nconn2 = rocket_contrib::mysql::Connection::init(\"eu.mysql\", None, \"user\", \"password\");\r\nconn3 = MyConfig::init(\"foo\", \"bar\", None);\r\n\r\n// state_pool!(<container_name>, <implementation_name>, <instance>);\r\nlet pool1 = state_pool!(\"MysqlUs\", rocket_contrib::mysql::Pool, conn1);\r\nlet pool2 = state_pool!(\"MysqlEu\", rocket_contrib::mysql::Pool, conn2);\r\nlet pool3 = state_pool!(\"Foo\", MyCustomPool, conn3);\r\n\r\nrocket\r\n    .manage(pool1)\r\n    .manage(pool2)\r\n    .manage(pool3);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's much that could be done to remove much of the boiler plate (maybe even a `#[derive StatePool]`), but as an initial implementation it certainly would make setup of several connections trivial.  I've only been writing Rust for the past 6 days, so I have no idea regarding the merit of my ideas yet, but hopefully they're at least constructive to the

names for our databases.\r\n- [x] Clarify `#cfg()` features structure\r\n- [x] Clarify configuration for connection\r\n- [ ] Clarify logging for connection\r\n- [ ] Fix tests\r\n- [ ] Fix examples\r\n- [ ] etc.\r\n\r\nRight now my goal is to set myself and get into documentation of Rocket and read it as much as possible to get some small things like `Config` and everything else what I

`Storage`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/176/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"itang","id":54437,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54437?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itang","html_url":"https://github.com/itang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-31T13:05:45Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T13:05:45Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/itang/tangcloud/issues/11","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/itang/tangcloud","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/itang/tangcloud/issues/11/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/itang/tangcloud/issues/11/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/itang/tangcloud/issues/11/events","html_url":"https://github.com/itang/tangcloud/issues/11","id":232558923,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzI1NTg5MjM=","number":11,"title":"[Rust-Rocket]

looking into working on this feature, and one difficulty we have is that we want to be able to have multiple databases with the same (r2d2/adapter) connection type and still be able to distinguish them by their type, at compile time, so we can implement `FromRequest` for each individual database. That way we open only the connections we need in each handler without boilerplate in the handler body.\r\n\r\nHere's one possible solution:\r\n\r\nIn `Rocket.toml`\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[development.databases.mysql-eu]\r\nhost = \"...\"\r\n\r\n[development.databases.mysql-us]\r\nhost =  \"...\"\r\n\r\n[development.databases.redis]\r\nhost = \"...\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the app\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(DatabaseConnectionPool)]\r\nstruct MysqlUs;\r\n\r\n#[derive(DatabaseConnectionPool)]\r\nstruct MysqlEu;\r\n\r\n#[derive(DatabaseConnectionPool)]\r\n#[name = \"redis\"]\r\nstruct RedisConnection;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince I don't think it is possible to read the `Rocket.toml` in a custom derive implementation, the generated implementation would have to fail on initialization if there is no corresponding database entry in `Rocket.toml`.\r\n\r\nOne other question is where the custom derive code should live. I thought it would have to be in `rocket-codegen` or its own crate, which would be unfortunate, but apparently diesel manages to reexport the derive functionality so we could conveniently put it behind a feature gate.\r\n\r\nDoes this look like a reasonable way to approach this feature?\r\n\r\nedit: I have thought about what the impl for `DatabaseConnectionPool` for the structs would be, it's not as straightforward as I initially imagined. They probably need to hold an r2d2 pool of the right type, etc. Also, an ordinary macro probably makes more sense than a custom derive.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/357501913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tomhoule","id":13155277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTU1Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13155277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule","html_url":"https://github.com/tomhoule","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/362736229","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/167#issuecomment-362736229","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/167","id":362736229,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MjczNjIyOQ==","user":{"login":"ELD","id":650044,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDA0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/650044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD","html_url":"https://github.com/ELD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-02T23:11:43Z","updated_at":"2018-02-02T23:11:43Z","body":"@SergioBenitez So, I've thought a bit about this too and would be interested in working on implementing it. It's similar to the one above here and also seems similar (but not identical) to your wishlist from your RustConf talk. For this particular approach, the `Cargo.toml` is what's used to specify the connection type(s). The `#[derive(DbConn)]` concept is almost identical to mine.\r\n\r\nCargo.toml:\r\n```toml\r\n...\r\n[dependencies]\r\nrocket_contrib = { version = \"0.4\", features = [\"diesel_postgres\"] }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(ConnectionPool)]\r\npub struct PrimaryConnection(pub Pool<ConnectionManager<PgConnection>>);\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let my_connection_string = env::var(\"DATABASE_URL\").ok();\r\n    rocket::ignite()\r\n        .manage(init_pool::<PrimaryConnection>(my_connection_string))\r\n        .mount(\"/\", routes![test])\r\n

This is approximately the interface I had in mind as well. In particular, pages 84 through 86 of my [RustConf talk slides on Rocket](https://sergio.bz/docs/rocket-rustconf-slides.pdf) demonstrate what I had in mind. There, the user's type represents a single connection, not a pool, and directly indicates the type of connection via an inner type.\r\n\r\nBecause configuration can be dynamically set at run-time via environment variables or in the code itself, we can't rely on anything in `Rocket.toml`; we can only rely on the `Config` at run-time. Thus, the implementation would, indeed, need to fail at initialization. This is made nice and clean with [attach fairings](https://api.rocket.rs/rocket/fairing/trait.Fairing.html#fairing-callbacks). This implies that the user is going to need to attach a fairing for this to work. In all, the user will need to write something like the following:\r\n\r\nIn `Rocket.toml`, or the equivalent at run-time:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[[global.databases]]\r\nname = \"my_sqlite_db\"\r\nadapter = \"diesel\"\r\n\r\n[[global.databases]]\r\nname = \"my_postgres_db\"\r\nadapter = \"rust-postgres\"\r\nurl = \"pg://my/postgres/db\"\r\nusername = \"sergio\"\r\npassword = \"honyedoodle\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `main.rs`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse rocket_contrib::Databases;\r\n\r\n#[derive(DbConn)]\r\n#[database(\"my_sqlite_db\")]\r\nstruct DbConn(diesel::SqliteConnection);\r\n\r\n#[derive(DbConn)]\r\n#[database(\"my_postgres_db\")]\r\nstruct DbConn(postgres::Connection);\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    rocket::ignite()\r\n        .attach(Databases::fairing())\r\n        .launch();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `Databases` fairing would read the `Config` at run-time and generate the pools for the specified adapters, building a structure mapping database name to database pool. We'd implement `FromRequest` for all `T: DbConn` by looking up the database pool for the given database name, grabbing one connection, and storing it in the user's type. This is identical to what we [advocate for in the guide](https://rocket.rs/guide/state/#connection-guard).\r\n\r\nIdeally, it would be impossible for the request guard implementation to fail if the database fairing attaches successfully. This would mean that we check, at initialization, that the user configured a database with every given name of the right type. I'm not sure how to accomplish this just yet, but I'd love ideas. One possible approach is for the `DbConn` derive to store structures containing the relevant database information in a special section of the binary. The fairing would then iterate through structures in this section, checking the required information.\r\n\r\nAs far as where the code should go: we should write the code in a new `proc-macro` crate (still likely a derive) and reexport it from `contrib` when a feature-flag is set.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/362739444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1456090722,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQ1NjA5MDcyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/1456090722","actor":{"login":"tomhoule","id":13155277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTU1Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13155277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule","html_url":"https://github.com/tomhoule","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-02T23:27:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1456090723,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0NTYwOTA3MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/1456090723","actor":{"login":"tomhoule","id":13155277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTU1Mjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13155277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule","html_url":"https://github.com/tomhoule","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomhoule/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-02T23:27:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/362872018","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/167#issuecomment-362872018","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/167","id":362872018,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2Mjg3MjAxOA==","user":{"login":"ELD","id":650044,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MDA0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/650044?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD","html_url":"https://github.com/ELD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ELD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-04T01:27:24Z","updated_at":"2018-02-04T01:27:24Z","body":"@tomhoule
