const expressions must be concrete\r\n\r\nAssociated consts can only be used in const contexts if their input types are _fully concrete_. That is, this works:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Foo {\r\n     const X: usize;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Foo for () {\r\n     const X = 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet y: [i32; <() as Foo>::X];\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this does not work:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn foo<T: Foo>() {\r\n    let y: [i32; <T as Foo>::X];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Associated consts are never object safe\r\n\r\nAssociated consts make a trait non-object-safe. There is no way to bound the const `where Self: Sized`, nor to specify the const when creating the object.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Foo {\r\n    const FOO: i32;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Not allowed:\r\nBox<Foo<FOO = 0>>\r\n\r\ntrait Bar {\r\n    // Not allowed\r\n    const BAR: i32 where Self: Sized;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Associated consts referencing other associated consts have spurious destructor warnings\r\n\r\nThis works:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Foo {\r\n    const FOO: Option<i32>;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait Bar: Foo + 'static {\r\n    const BAR: Option<i32> = <Self as Foo>::FOO;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this does not, because we (unnecessarily) assume the const could be a variant that runs a destructor:\r\n\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Foo {\r\n    const FOO: Option<String>;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait Bar: Foo + 'static {\r\n    const BAR: Option<String> = <Self as Foo>::FOO;\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29646/reactions","total_count":17,"+1":17,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/29646/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"brson","id":147214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson","html_url":"https://github.com/brson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-11T02:23:01Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T02:23:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111","id":66616615,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NjYxNjYxNQ==","number":24111,"title":"const

PR represents my efforts as a beginner Rust programmer to rewrite the UI so that it's rendered by the server, instead of by Ember in the browser.\r\n\r\nFor the pages converted so far, `/` and

would be a welcome change, so I've only gone far enough to have a working prototype. Here's why I think it's worthwhile:\r\n\r\n+ dogfooding\r\n  + Crates.io could become a great example of how to build server-side apps, like Rubygems.org\r\n  + this paves the way to write WebAssembly instead of JavaScript\r\n+ ease of contribution\r\n  + Ember is a great framework, but for such a simple app it just adds complexity & duplication\r\n  + the burden on new contributors to learn Rust, Conduit, JavaScript, and Ember shouldn't be understated\r\n+ performance\r\n  + the main page takes roughly a second for assets to load & boot, then another second for API requests to finish\r\n  + the API definitely needs to be optimized, but that first second of delay can only be removed with server-side rendering\r\n+ security\r\n  + browser scripting exposes you to risks sometimes as bad as the attacker [gaining local root](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=766253)\r\n\r\n### Which web framework?\r\n\r\nCurrently we're using Conduit. There's a lot of options these days; does anyone have experience with those others, and would they be a better choice if we switch to server-side rendering?\r\n\r\nSimilarly, which Crates.io features might be so complex to hand-roll that it makes this conversion much more difficult?

likely.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/1173/reactions","total_count":29,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":7,"confused":0,"heart":11,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/1173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"pwoolcoc","id":620392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMDM5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/620392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwoolcoc","html_url":"https://github.com/pwoolcoc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwoolcoc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwoolcoc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwoolcoc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwoolcoc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwoolcoc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwoolcoc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwoolcoc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwoolcoc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwoolcoc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-30T22:12:41Z","updated_at":"2017-11-30T22:12:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Aardwolf-Social/aardwolf-social/issues/17","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Aardwolf-Social/aardwolf-social","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Aardwolf-Social/aardwolf-social/issues/17/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Aardwolf-Social/aardwolf-social/issues/17/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Aardwolf-Social/aardwolf-social/issues/17/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Aardwolf-Social/aardwolf-social/pull/17","id":278189951,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTU1NjYwNDAw","number":17,"title":"Rust

Hecate relies on the [Rocket](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket) web framework, which requires the use of the unstable/nightly Rust compiler. Nightly contains language features that are subject to change, and also [breaks occasionally](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/40106), and at least per the current instructions (which recommend installing the latest nightly), each developer contributing to the project might end up with a different compiler with different features, behavior, and bugs depending on when they happen to set up their dev environment.\r\n\r\nRocket itself [doesn't seem particularly close](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/19) to running on stable (it seems like a project mostly interesting in pushing the language envelope rather than running on stable), and independent of stable vs unstable, the lead dev anticipates a [major API overhaul](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket#future-improvements) to move towards async as the Rust async story matures.\r\n\r\nThe ergonomics do seem nice, but in the interests of building on a solid foundation and making it easy for everyone to work on it, I wonder if we shouldn't consider moving to a framework with a stable API that runs on the stable compiler? [Nickel](http://nickel-org.github.io/) seems like a possibility, or if we wanted to get a head-start on async, maybe [Gotham](https://gotham.rs/)
