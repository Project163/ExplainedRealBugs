now, rocket compiles and runs this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![feature(plugin)]\r\n#![plugin(rocket_codegen)]\r\n\r\nextern crate rocket;\r\nuse std::sync::atomic::{Ordering, AtomicUsize};\r\n\r\nstruct

attempted, there should be a warning about that.*\r\n\r\n*500 is returned from a request to `/` because of unmanaged state. But one wouldn't know the state is unmanaged unless the particular route is being tested (other requests like `/foo` function as expected).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure we could easily get this to warn/error during compilation, but we certainly should be able to print a warning _upon launch_ for both of these cases. This would improve usability and reduce bug potential.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/464/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
