Before I discuss that, I want to note that `[` and `]` are _not_ valid URI characters in that position. In particular, [RFC 3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-D.1) is fairly clear about this (emphasis mine):\r\n\r\n>    IPv6 (and later) literals have been added to the list of possible\r\n   identifiers for the host portion of an authority component, as\r\n   described by [RFC2732], with the addition of \"[\" and \"]\" to the\r\n   reserved set and a version flag to anticipate future versions of IP\r\n   literals.  **Square brackets are now specified as reserved within the\r\n   authority component and are not allowed outside their use as\r\n   delimiters for an IP literal within host.**  In order to make this\r\n   change without changing the technical definition of the path, query,\r\n   and fragment components, those rules were redefined to directly\r\n   specify the characters allowed.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, `|` and `\\` are also not valid URI characters. The implication is that 1) the browser should not send those character in-the-raw (are you sending a request from a browser?), and 2) Rocket's `Uri::percent_encode()` (and transitively, `uri!`) should percent-encode these characters. It seems that Rocket isn't doing the latter, which we should fix.\r\n\r\nI'll have a fix ASAP.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/435280795/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1942278891,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5NDIyNzg4OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/1942278891","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-02T07:08:50Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1942285442,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTk0MjI4NTQ0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/1942285442","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"5762208bbacf873d2512e64603e66492bd3adb63","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/commits/5762208bbacf873d2512e64603e66492bd3adb63","created_at":"2018-11-02T07:14:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13766682272,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzqMt84WcMsZzwAAAAM0juag","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/13766682272","actor":{"login":"Eijebong","id":3650385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTAzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3650385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong","html_url":"https://github.com/Eijebong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/receive
