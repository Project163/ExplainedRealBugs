Of course you wouldn't know that as the entire listener module is yet to be documented 🙃. \n\nFor your use-case in particular however, it sounds like you'd be better served defining your own structure with an `EndPoint` (and any other config, like `TlsConfig`) in it and creating your own bindable from that. Those parts are designed to be composable and reusable, whereas default listener is really only exposed to document the config parameters that Rocket uses for its listener by default. Given you mention actually wanting access to `base_listener` instead, which is mostly a simple cfg-aware match-and-extract, using your own config struct in your implementation will probably result in at least as clean an implementation as it otherwise would.

If we exposed that, it sounds like this qualm would dissipate. Again, something you could choose to contribute that would benefit others while making your life much easier. \n\nBut to be clear, there's no assumption to be made here. The structure is well defined with a documented API. Obviously if there's a breaking change that impacts you, then you need to update your code. But that would be a choice you make. And that would happen with any library, in any language, and has nothing to do with Rocket's internals nor making assumptions about them. \n\n> \n> \n> \n> And since I’m not reusing `DefaultListener`, I’ve also decided to limit my implementation to TCP sockets because supporting other socket types like UDS is considerable complexity and will likely break as Rocket evolves.\n\nNo, neither part of this statement is true. Listeners and connections compose, and since Rocket provides a UdsListener already, there's almost zero work you need to do to support them. If your custom TlsListener is designed generically, this would just work.  There's no reason for you to assume that something will break as Rocket evolves. \n\n> \n> \n> \n> Quite frankly, all of this feels like I’m doing way too much work.

We could easily switch to s2n tomorrow with 0 impact to users. That being said, as I've said before, I'm not opposed to exposing anything relevant here, as long as we do this in the right way. \n\nFinally, I'd like to ask you to be more understanding about the feature-set you're using and criticizing: the entire thing landed just weeks ago and is still  unreleased. To my knowledge, no other web framework in Rust offers the level of flexibility and composability that we've managed to get with the new listener/connection interfaces. Your commentary would be much better received if instead of _only_ criticizing the project, you instead sought to improve it.

Let me assure you that I did attempt to solve this issue on my own, and I would have contributed a fix had I been successful. Unfortunately, my knowledge of Rust turned out to be insufficient.\r\n\r\n> Finally, I'd like to ask you to be more understanding about the feature-set you're using and criticizing: the entire thing landed just weeks ago and is still unreleased.\r\n\r\nI am aware of that. That’s why I used a development version, with version 0.5 what I want cannot be done at all.\r\n\r\nI am also aware of the primary use case for the new API. Still, it’s my assumption that there is value in trying out a new API and testing its limitations before it is released to everyone. Particularly things that *look* like they should work but don’t.\r\n\r\n> It wouldn't be very difficult to modify TlsConfig to add this support and upstream it into Rocket.\r\n\r\nOk, I can create a pull request. I think the best approach would be adding a new field `to_rustls: Option<Fn(&Self, &Rocket) -> ServerConfig>` to `TlsConfig`. Presumably, I can make it deserialize as `None` while still allowing to set `tls.to_rustls` in the figment programmatically.\r\n\r\nThere should also be a `TlsConfig.default_to_rustls(&self) -> ServerConfig` method to be used as fallback if the new field is `None`. It can also be called by custom implementations to provide an initial config which can then be modified. This would contain the code currently in `TlsConfig::acceptor()`.\r\n\r\nObviously, documentation should containing a warning that Rustls (and its particular version) is an implementation detail which can change in future Rocket versions.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1953575588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"palant","id":374261,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDI2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/374261?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant","html_url":"https://github.com/palant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/palant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1953630360","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2730#issuecomment-1953630360","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2730","id":1953630360,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzqMt850cgiY","user":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-20T07:34:43Z","updated_at":"2024-02-20T07:34:43Z","body":"\n> Ok, I can create a pull request.

A `TryFrom<TlsConfig> for rustls::ServerConfig` implementation that simply calls the existing method (it's `server_config()`, currently on the h3 branch https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/blob/h3/core/lib/src/listener/tls.rs)\n\n2.
