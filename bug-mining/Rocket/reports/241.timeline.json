The way to do this is to implement [`FromParam`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/request/trait.FromParam.html) for the type. We could make the derive implement the `UriDisplay` trait in the way you want, but doing so would require significant work to account for similar use-cases. Instead, it's rather simple to implement `UriDisplay` here as well.\r\n\r\nThe [example](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/http/uri/fmt/trait.UriDisplay.html#example) shows how to do both. In your case, I would recommend doing something like this, part of which you already have:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, PartialEq)]\r\npub enum WebiconFamily {\r\n    Emojis,\r\n    Icons,\r\n}\r\n\r\npub struct ParseWebiconFamilyError;\r\n\r\nimpl WebiconFamily {\r\n    pub const fn as_str(&self) -> &'static str {\r\n        match self {\r\n            WebiconFamily::Emojis => \"emojis\",\r\n            WebiconFamily::Icons => \"icons\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl fmt::Display for WebiconFamily {\r\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>) -> fmt::Result {\r\n        self.as_str().fmt(f)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl FromStr for WebiconFamily {\r\n    type Err = ParseWebiconFamilyError;\r\n\r\n    fn from_str(s: &str) -> Result<Self, Self::Err> {\r\n        if s == WebiconFamily::Emojis.as_str() {\r\n            Ok(Self::Emojis)\r\n        } else if s == WebiconFamily::Icons.as_str() {\r\n            Ok(Self::Icons)\r\n        } else {\r\n            Err(ParseWebiconFamilyError)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<'r> FromParam<'r> for WebiconFamily {\r\n    type Error = ParseWebiconFamilyError;\r\n\r\n    #[inline]\r\n    fn from_param(param: &'r str) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {\r\n        param.parse()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl UriDisplay<Path> for WebiconFamily {\r\n    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<Path>) -> fmt::Result {\r\n        UriDisplay::fmt(&self.as_str(), f)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl_from_uri_param_identity!([Path] WebiconFamily);\r\n```","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1677914807/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1678001189","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2595#issuecomment-1678001189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2595","id":1678001189,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzqMt85kBEQl","user":{"login":"lindhe","id":7773090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NzMwOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7773090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindhe","html_url":"https://github.com/lindhe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindhe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindhe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindhe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindhe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindhe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindhe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindhe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindhe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindhe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-14T20:19:15Z","updated_at":"2023-08-14T20:19:15Z","body":"Thanks a bunch!\n\nAnd what about the C-style enum?
