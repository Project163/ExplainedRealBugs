think it's worth considering moving some of these into `core`, but not yet - IMO certainly not in `0.5`. The default features (`json` and `serve`) along with `helmet` stand out to me as possibilities.\r\n\r\nMy argument against pulling *all* of them into core, even in the future, is the sheer number of dependencies. There are about 16 dependencies for databases alone, plus another 15 or so. We have already had some issues with dependency versions where it might be nice to untether the release cycle of `rocket_contrib` from that of `rocket`, for example allowing `rocket_contrib` to advance to `2.0` and `3.0` while `rocket` remains at `1.0`. It may even make sense to further break out integrations with a short major version cycle (`rusqlite` is a example I can think of right now).\r\n\r\nOne data point I am very interested in is how many people are using which features. This is difficult to gauge because many projects using Rocket probably aren't public, but we might be able to get stats on public repositories at the very least.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/526423006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2595767667,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1OTU3Njc2Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/2595767667","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-30T01:47:20Z","label":{"name":"feedback

I do see the paradigm of many popular crates breaking up functionality into separate crates (tokio is the first that comes to mind) but the question I guess is, is that even a \"good\" way to do things?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/534743842/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TheBestJohn","id":1250510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1250510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn","html_url":"https://github.com/TheBestJohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/535770926","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1107#issuecomment-535770926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1107","id":535770926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNTc3MDkyNg==","user":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-27T03:25:19Z","updated_at":"2019-09-27T03:25:19Z","body":"> Objectively, can rocket_contrib be useful to any application other than rocket?\r\n\r\nNot really, but that shouldn't be the deciding factor.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n(Disclaimer: I don't know Sergio's original intentions for `rocket_contrib` and I may disagree with those in some respects. I also describe an ideal situation of sorts; reality sometimes misses the mark.)\r\n\r\nWhen I refer to `rocket`, I usually mean everything in `core/`: `rocket`, `rocket_http`, `rocket_codegen`.\r\n\r\nIMO `rocket` should always be solid and well audited, with only high-quality dependencies. Trusting `rocket` should be an easy choice to make: it should be API stable, it should be reliable at runtime (predictable, resilient, reasonable resource usage, etc.) It should not have unnecessary dependencies. Auditing `rocket` for correctness should not require checking the usage of (for example) a database crate, as it does not itself do anything interesting with databases. Provided request guards and responders should be more or less universally applicable.\r\n\r\n`rocket_contrib`, on the other hand, has more wiggle room. It depends on databases, template engines, filesystem watchers, (de)serialization libraries, and more. The release cycles and stability policies of those crates may not match with rocket's; they may not be as thoroughly tested on all platforms, etc. In the future, I do think the release cycle of `rocket_contrib` should be faster than that of `rocket`. I've even toyed with the idea of breaking database support out into a separate crate, just because of the dependency update cycles.\r\n\r\nIn all, I think the separation is important. We might merge or split functionality differently, but I think there will always be some features that are of high enough quality and usefulness to officially support, but not core enough to pull into every single application that uses `rocket`.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/535770926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/536611534","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1107#issuecomment-536611534","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1107","id":536611534,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzNjYxMTUzNA==","user":{"login":"TheBestJohn","id":1250510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1250510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn","html_url":"https://github.com/TheBestJohn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheBestJohn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-30T15:19:24Z","updated_at":"2019-09-30T15:19:24Z","body":"You've swayed me.
