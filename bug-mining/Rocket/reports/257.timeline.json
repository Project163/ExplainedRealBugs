It's not clear to me whether the library can correctly be used in an `async` server, however, as its docs don't state whether methods like [`poll`](https://docs.rs/quiche/latest/quiche/h3/struct.Connection.html#method.poll) block.\r\n\r\nAside from `quiche`, the only other viable alternative I'm aware of is [`h3`](https://github.com/hyperium/h3), which would become hyper's HTTP/3 backend. According to the README, it is \"still very experimental\", and the [report](https://hyper.rs/h3/ci/compliance/report.html#/) indicates there's still quite a road to be compliant. Nevertheless, it seems viable to integrate into Rocket as a sort of \"draft\" or \"preview\" of HTTP/3 support. If there is some way to integrate `h3` into Rocket in such a way that doesn't require drastically changing the existing codebase, I'd be all for it. Otherwise, we'll just have to wait for `hyper` to gain support or some other library to pop up.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1938430356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1939814073","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2723#issuecomment-1939814073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2723","id":1939814073,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzqMt85znza5","user":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-12T23:57:26Z","updated_at":"2024-02-12T23:58:35Z","body":"I wanted to experiment, so I've [landed experimental HTTP/3 support](https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/tree/h3) based on `s2n-quic` and a patched version of `h3`.\r\n\r\nIt works!\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n> cd examples/tls\r\n> cargo run\r\n...\r\n🚀 Rocket has launched on https://127.0.0.1:8000 (TLS + MTLS)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncurl -k --http3-only -v https://127.0.0.1:8000       master ●\r\n*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8000...\r\n* Skipped certificate verification\r\n* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8000\r\n* using HTTP/3\r\n* [HTTP/3] [0] OPENED stream for https://127.0.0.1:8000/\r\n* [HTTP/3] [0] [:method: GET]\r\n* [HTTP/3] [0] [:scheme: https]\r\n* [HTTP/3] [0] [:authority: 127.0.0.1:8000]\r\n* [HTTP/3] [0] [:path: /]\r\n* [HTTP/3] [0] [user-agent: curl/8.6.0]\r\n* [HTTP/3] [0] [accept: */*]\r\n> GET / HTTP/3\r\n> Host: 127.0.0.1:8000\r\n> User-Agent: curl/8.6.0\r\n> Accept: */*\r\n>\r\n< HTTP/3 200\r\n< content-type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\r\n< server: Rocket\r\n< x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN\r\n< x-content-type-options: nosniff\r\n< permissions-policy: interest-cohort=()\r\n< content-length: 13\r\n<\r\n* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact\r\nHello, world!%\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this `h3` branch, only the quic/http3 server runs when the `http3` feature is enabled.

I'll continue to push commits to the branch. I've just now pushed a nearly \"complete\" version. It's likely that we'll need to rewrite/significantly improve the `h3` integration for `s2n` as well as `h3` itself. This is because at the moment, there's no way to get an `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` stream to the client once the HTTP3 request has been received. This means we can't directly integrate with the existing `Listener`/`Connection` APIs, which means we don't get graceful shutdown for \"free\".\r\n\r\nIn short, we need to _really_ implement `Listener` for some `H3Quic` type and get rid of `Void`

Ideally we can get the s2n-quic-h3 crate published so you're not having to maintain a fork.\r\n\r\nReally appreciate the comment! Thank you!\r\n\r\nAt the moment, aside from https://github.com/aws/s2n-quic/pull/2055, the biggest issues are:\r\n  * The server's `accept()` method requires an `&mut` reference. This means that we can't accept from multiple threads without synchronization. This is probably fine, but it deviates from existing connection-like interfaces such as [`TcpListener::accept()`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/net/struct.TcpListener.html#method.accept). This is also the case on the `h3` side, so improving this only on the `s2n` will unfortunately be insufficient.\r\n  * This is mostly on the `h3` side, but the lack of `Stream` and `AsyncWrite` implementations on the \"fully accepted HTTP3 stream.\" In other words, we'd really like to have a read/write stream to the HTTP3 body once an HTTP3 request has been parsed out, but that's not currently possible because [h3](https://docs.rs/h3/latest/h3/index.html)::[server](https://docs.rs/h3/latest/h3/server/index.html)::[RequestStream](https://docs.rs/h3/latest/h3/server/struct.RequestStream.html#) doesn't implement `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite`, and an efficient implementation outside of `h3` isn't possible due to the use of the `Buf` trait. We end up with:\r\n \r\n    ```rust\r\n    pub struct QuicRx(h3::RequestStream<quic_h3::RecvStream, Bytes>);\r\n\r\n    pub struct QuicTx(h3::RequestStream<quic_h3::SendStream<Bytes>, Bytes>);\r\n\r\n    impl Stream for QuicRx {\r\n        type Item = io::Result<Bytes>;\r\n\r\n        fn poll_next(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Option<Self::Item>> {\r\n            use bytes::Buf;\r\n\r\n            match ready!(self.0.poll_recv_data(cx)) {\r\n                Ok(Some(mut buf)) => Poll::Ready(Some(Ok(buf.copy_to_bytes(buf.remaining())))),\r\n                Ok(None) => Poll::Ready(None),\r\n                Err(e) => Poll::Ready(Some(Err(io::Error::other(e)))),\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    impl AsyncWrite for QuicTx {\r\n        fn poll_write(\r\n            mut self: Pin<&mut Self>,\r\n            cx: &mut Context<'_>,\r\n            buf: &[u8],\r\n        ) -> Poll<io::Result<usize>> {\r\n            let len = buf.len();\r\n            let result = ready!(self.0.poll_send_data(cx, Bytes::copy_from_slice(buf)));\r\n            result.map_err(io::Error::other)?;\r\n            Poll::Ready(Ok(len))\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        fn poll_flush(self: Pin<&mut Self>, _: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<io::Result<()>> {\r\n            Poll::Ready(Ok(()))\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        fn poll_shutdown(self: Pin<&mut Self>, _: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<io::Result<()>> {\r\n            Poll::Ready(Ok(()))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    The simplest way to resolve this would likely be for `h3` to implement `Stream` and `AsyncWrite` if the underlying streams do, which in this case would mean that s2n's `RecvStream` and `SendStream` would need the appropriate implementations.\r\n\r\nIn general, it seems that most if not all of the issues I've encountered are due to `h3`.

The server's accept() method requires an &mut reference.

We start with something we can `bind()` to. This is usually a `SocketAddr`, reified as [`Bindable`](https://api.rocket.rs/master/rocket/listener/trait.Bindable.html). Calling `bind()` returns a [`Listener`](https://api.rocket.rs/rocket/listener/trait.listener).\r\n  2. The listener `accept`s connections in two phases: `accept()` and `connect()`.\r\n \r\n     The contract is such that `accept()` must do as little work as possible as it is intended to be used in an accept-loop. `connect()` on the other hand is expected to be called in a separate task and can do whatever work is needed to prepare the connection for reading/writing. This is where the TLS handshake occurs, for example.\r\n\r\n  3. An HTTP request is read from the connection.\r\n\r\nMapping this to HTTP3/quic with the current implementations is proving to be challenging because accepting a connection and reading an HTTP request is currently interleaved in a difficult-to-compose manner. As it stands, we go quic -> HTTP3 -> connection. In other words, we need to do some work with HTTP3 before we can get our hands on a valid peer connection.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem endemic to the design, however. If we instead reverse the arrows (quic -> connection -> HTTP3), then we recover the previous design. Concretely, this would mean that `s2n_quic_h3` has _some_ type `T` that implements [h3](https://docs.rs/h3/latest/h3/index.html)::[quic](https://docs.rs/h3/latest/h3/quic/index.html)::[Connection](https://docs.rs/h3/latest/h3/quic/trait.Connection.html#) while also being `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`. I believe that type is [`PeerStream`](https://docs.rs/s2n-quic/latest/s2n_quic/stream/enum.PeerStream.html).\r\n\r\nDo you think it's possible to implement `h3::Connection` for `PeerStream`, or some other type that would provide the sought-after behavior?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1960302116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1990539147","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2723#issuecomment-1990539147","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2723","id":1990539147,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzqMt852pTeL","user":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-12T05:23:12Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T05:23:12Z","body":"The `h3` branch now implements complete support for HTTP3.
