There is no way to disable this, even when Rocket is instantiated via `Rocket::custom()` with `log` set to `false`.\r\n\r\nThis error log is passed to the common project logging facility, which gets printed to console / error log / etc in production environments. This is not an error per-say, but rather an informational message.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see this log level lowered a bit, ie. to `info!()`, or at least being able to hide this message.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this: I used Rocket in 2 OSS projects: [valeriansaliou/vigil](http://github.com/valeriansaliou/vigil) and [valeriansaliou/raider](http://github.com/valeriansaliou/raider). I got a report ([#1](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/vigil/issues/1#issuecomment-360264846)) of an user asking about this weird behavior (thinking it came from a mis-configuration from my code). I share his point of view, this is quite annoying in projects that rely on Rocket and only need important error logs shown as output.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/553/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/553/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
