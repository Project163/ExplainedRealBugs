generally have `clippy::pedantic` set to warn, and trying to use the default example code.\r\n\r\nThe specific lints are:\r\n\r\n    * `clippy::no_effect_underscore_binding` (from pedantic)\r\n\r\n    * `clippy::uninlined_format_args` (from pedantic)\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nThe following code can be used with the latest version of rocket on a fresh `cargo init`.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![warn(clippy::pedantic)]\r\n\r\n#[macro_use]\r\nextern crate rocket;\r\n\r\n#[get(\"/<name>/<age>\")]\r\nfn hello(name: &str, age: u8) -> String {\r\n    format!(\"Hello, {} year old named {}!\", age, name)\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[launch]\r\nfn rocket() -> _ {\r\n    rocket::build().mount(\"/hello\", routes![hello])\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSwitching to a static return type `Rocket<Build>` does not change the warnings.  \r\nI believe this is because the `#[launch]` macro uses many underscore bindings, without allow.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let _ = ::rocket::async_main(\r\n        {\r\n            let ___rocket: ::rocket::Rocket<::rocket::Build> = {\r\n                rocket::build()\r\n                    .mount(\r\n

let ___item: ::rocket::Route = ___struct.into_route();\r\n                                        ___item\r\n                                    },\r\n                                ]),\r\n

derive.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n    * OS Distribution and Kernel: Windows 11 23H2\r\n\r\n    * Rocket Version: 0.5.0\r\n\r\nBased on a similar issue #2655
