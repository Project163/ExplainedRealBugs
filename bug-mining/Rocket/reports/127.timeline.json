There are some long-standing TODOs around that API to come up with something nicer. But even if we *did* add a public constructor for `Cookies`, since it is passed by value into the route handler there would be no way to inspect the cookies after the call.\r\n\r\nBoth of these problems can be worked around today by using the [dedicated testing API](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.4/rocket/local/index.html), which simulates a User-Agent including cookie handling. There is still a deficiency, in that the test code can't directly add or remove cookies as you are doing in your hypothetical test.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/644446511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3446624501,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM0NDY2MjQ1MDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/3446624501","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-15T23:42:28Z","label":{"name":"deficiency","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/645803484","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1332#issuecomment-645803484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1332","id":645803484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0NTgwMzQ4NA==","user":{"login":"joelparkerhenderson","id":27145,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27145?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelparkerhenderson","html_url":"https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelparkerhenderson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelparkerhenderson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelparkerhenderson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelparkerhenderson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelparkerhenderson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelparkerhenderson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelparkerhenderson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelparkerhenderson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelparkerhenderson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-18T06:18:07Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T06:18:07Z","body":"Good info, thank you.
