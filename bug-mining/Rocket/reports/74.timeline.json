Feature Requests\r\nPlease consider implementing `Responder` for  `Box<T> where T: Responder`.\r\nThis would allow a function to easily return multiple types of Response.\r\nI've tried doing this with a function that returns `impl Responder`, but that gives me an error if I try to return multiple types that each implement `Responder`.\r\nI'm thinking of a function that would potentially return e.g. a Template in one case, and maybe a redirect or a flash in another case.\r\nI've kind of managed to hack around this in one case by returning `Result<Flash<Redirect>, Template>`, but that feels wrong because there are 2 error conditions - one error case redirects (as does the success case), while the other error case returns a template.\r\nYou may argue that this is the wrong way of doing it, but having the ability to do this would really help me reuse more of the code that I've already written.\r\nI've not found any way to implement this or something similar (e.g. a wrapper type) that doesn't have too much code overhead, although if someone has an alternative approach here I'd be willing to look at that.\r\n\r\nBelow is the error message that I currently get when I define a function to return `Box<Response>`:\r\n```\r\nerror[E0277]: the trait bound `std::boxed::Box<rocket::response::Responder<'static>>: rocket::response::Responder<'_>` is not satisfied\r\n  -->
