I would suggest to implement this using `Option<PathBuf>`: \r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[get(\"/<path..>\")]\r\nfn everything(path: Option<PathBuf>) -> String {\r\n    format!(\"{:?}\", path)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should respond to any subpath of `/` as usual, but also respond to an access to `/` with `path=None`.\r\n\r\nCurrent behavior seems to be ignoring the `Option<>` entirely and treating the argument as usual, so it shouldn't break backwards compatibility (badly).\r\n\r\nYou can work around the issue by internally redirecting another route:\r\n```rust\r\n#[get(\"/\")]\r\nfn index() -> String {\r\n    everything(None)\r\n}\r\n#[get(\"/<path..>\")]\r\nfn everything(path: Option<PathBuf>) -> String {\r\n    format!(\"{:?}\", path)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is neither ergonomic nor intuitive.\r\n\r\nA relatively simple usecase could be file access with a directory listing: accessing a directory lists its contents. Access to the root dir would require this feature. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/985/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/985/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
