It's apparently not in `Program Files` or in the chocolatey directory. I didn't check `Program Files (x86)`, but I didn't think the 32-bit version would be selected.

new to Rust and Rocket and stuck completely by connecting to a database.\r\nThe official guide is quite superficial at this point in my opinion and I assume I'm not the only one with problems by setting up database connection.\r\n\r\nThat's why I suggest to extend the guide with an example for each database.\r\nFurthermore I would appreciate any help for my described errors.\r\n\r\n## System\r\nWindows 10 Pro, Visual Studio Build Tools 2019\r\n\r\n## Errors\r\n### MongoDB\r\nCargo.toml\r\n```\r\n[dependencies]\r\nrocket = \"0.4.1\"\r\nrocket_contrib = {version = \"0.4.1\", features

`link.exe` failed: exit code: 1120\r\nerror LNK2019: Link to not resolved symbol ...**\r\n\r\nThis is definitely caused by

Conclusion\r\nIt seems that the steps described in the guide are not enough to succeed on an average Windows PC.\r\nI tried to install some libraries manually, as supposed by error messages (openssl, openssl-sys, libmysql, mysql-sys), but it is still not working.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1002/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/492088588","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/801#issuecomment-492088588","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/801","id":492088588,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MjA4ODU4OA==","user":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-14T05:52:30Z","updated_at":"2019-05-14T05:52:30Z","body":"Unfortunately
