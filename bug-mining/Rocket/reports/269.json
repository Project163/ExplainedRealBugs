API Docs to Existing Functionality\n\nhttps://api.rocket.rs/v0.5/rocket/http/struct.Status\n\n### Problems with Existing Functionality\n\nStatus does not implement `PartialEq` via `derive(PartialEq)`, which causes it to lack `StructuralPartialEq`.\r\n\r\nIt prohibits using status in match:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nmatch status {\r\n    Status::Unauthorized => { ... },\r\n    Status::NotFound => { ... },\r\n    _ => { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecause `Status::Unauthorized` is a constant which triggers error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: to use a constant of type `rocket::http::Status` in a pattern, `rocket::http::Status` must be annotated with `#[derive(PartialEq)]`\r\n  --> my_project/src/errors.rs:40:13\r\n   |\r\n40 |             Status::Unauthorized => { ... },\r\n   |             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n   |\r\n   = note: the traits must be derived, manual `impl`s are not sufficient\r\n   = note: see https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.StructuralPartialEq.html for details\r\n``` \n\n### Suggested Changes\n\nI've looked at current implementation of `PartialEq` for `Status`:\r\nhttps://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/blob/1a3ef5b23fdf4a4619fa9b5d3f24cff6f8008085/core/http/src/status.rs#L363C1-L367C2\r\n\r\nAnd it seems that there is nothing prohibiting automatic derive. \n\n### Alternatives Considered\n\nAn alternative solution to my `match` expression is something like this:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nmatch status {\r\n    status if status == Status::Unauthorized => { ... },\r\n    status if status == Status::TooManyRequests => { ... },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't feel idiomatic. \r\n\r\nAnother would be to use code directly:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nmatch status.code {\r\n    401 => { ... },\r\n    429 => { ... }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut here I'm more prone to the typo than using existing constant.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Checks\n\n- [X] I do not believe that this suggestion can or should be implemented outside of Rocket.\n\n- [X] I was unable to find a previous suggestion for this change.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
