makes it possible to register helper functions with Handlebars and Tera, resolving #64.\r\n\r\nI'm using this locally to update Crates.io to use server-side rendering: https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/1173.\r\n\r\nThat branch is out of date currently; here's how I'm using this feature:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// src/lib.rs\r\n\r\npub fn route(app: App) {\r\n    rocket::ignite()\r\n        .mount(\"/\", routes![html::index])\r\n        .attach(Template::fairing_with(|context| {\r\n            html::register_helpers(&mut context.engines.handlebars);\r\n        }))\r\n        .launch();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```rust\r\n// src/html/mod.rs\r\n\r\n#[get(\"/\")]\r\npub fn index() -> Template {\r\n    let mut json = json!({});\r\n    json[\"current_user\"] = json!({\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"Sean Linsley\"});\r\n\r\n    Template::render(\"index\", &json)\r\n}\r\n\r\npub fn register_helpers(handlebars: &mut Handlebars) {\r\n    handlebars.register_helper(\"format_num\", Box::new(format_num));\r\n    handlebars.register_helper(\"embed_svg\", Box::new(embed_svg));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere have been two previous PRs to try adding this feature: #60 and #364. @SergioBenitez has wanted the ability to register the same helper functions on both rendering engines simultaneously, but I'm not sure that's possible because of the library-specific code inside of the helper functions themselves.\r\n\r\nInstead I opted to make the underlying template objects accessible via a callback passed to `Template::fairing_with`. Is there a better name for this function?\r\n\r\nOnce we're happy with this change, I'll update the documentation and write a test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/350568992","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/64#issuecomment-350568992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/64","id":350568992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDU2ODk5Mg==","user":{"login":"seanlinsley","id":688886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/688886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley","html_url":"https://github.com/seanlinsley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-10T18:43:04Z","updated_at":"2017-12-10T18:43:04Z","body":"I've

existing fairing code, since\r\nI can't get access to the underlying `Context`-element that contains the engine through the managed state, because it's not publically exported (at least not in version
