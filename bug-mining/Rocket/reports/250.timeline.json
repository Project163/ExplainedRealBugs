However, I think we should follow a more explicit route, akin to what tools normally do. In particular, changing the color settings to parse `always`, `auto`, and `never` as their name suggests. Internally we can use an `Option<bool>` or an enum - I'd be fine with either, though perhaps an enum would be more self-descriptive. And finally, we'd ideally continue to support the options as before with the same functionality as before, so that this is a backwards compatible change.
