After removing the leading and trailing comment lines (beginning with \"#\"), Rocket accepted it, but I don't think we'd be allowed to remove the comments as they're used to mark the confidentiality of the files.\r\n\r\nAccording to [RFC 7468](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7468#section-2), \"Data before the encapsulation boundaries are permitted, and parsers MUST NOT malfunction when processing such data.\"\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nAdd a new line with `# test comment` at the beginning of `examples/tls/private/rsa_sha256_key.pem`, and then run the tls example.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nShould recognize the file as containing an RSA private key.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n - OS Distribution and Kernel: CentOS container\r\n - Rocket Version: 0.5.0-rc.2\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this issue is in Rocket itself, or an underlying TLS library. The stacktrace just pointed to `error.rs` and a bunch of stuff in `std`, so I'm not sure where Rocket actually reads the key file.\r\n\r\nRocket seems to have no issue with the leading comments in the PEM-formated certificate file; just the key file.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2281/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
