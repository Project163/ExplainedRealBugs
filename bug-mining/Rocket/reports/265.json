I'm back, I had to temporarily step away from Foss, but i'm back and happy to respond.\r\n\r\nIn terms of what you said: I ment `FromFormField`, which would not work anyway as `Range<T>` would most likely have to be implemented over two fields.\r\nIn terms of what it should look like in a form, you would most likely have two fields in the form `<range_var_name>.start` and `<range_var_name>.end`. I chose those names as that is what the `Range<T>` type uses internally. \r\n\r\nExample HTML Rendered:\r\n![grafik](https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/assets/73720453/94b6d70c-e520-4a4e-b316-1bef0341fbae)\r\n\r\nExample HTML Source:\r\n```html\r\n<form class=\"Search\" id=\"PrimeNumberSearch\" action=\"{{https_url_for(request, 'SearchPrimeResult')}}\" target=\"PrimeNumberSearchIF\">\r\n    <input type=\"number\" name=\"prime_range.start\" placeholder=\"min prime\">\r\n    <input type=\"number\" name=\"prime_range.end\" placeholder=\"max prime\">\r\n    <button class=\"submit\" type=\"submit\">→</button>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample Rocket Function:\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Debug, FromForm)]\r\nstruct FormData {\r\n    prime_range: Range<i64>,\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[get(\"/prime\", data=\"<form>\")]\r\nasync fn get_prime_form(db: &PrimeDB, form: Form<FormData>) -> Result<Json<Vec<i64>>, Status> {\r\n    Ok(Json(get_primes(db, form.into_inner().prime_range).await?))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it would of course also work outside of a struct:\r\n```rust\r\n#[get(\"/prime\", data=\"<form>\")]\r\nasync fn get_prime_form(db: &PrimeDB, form: Form<Range<i64>>) -> Result<Json<Vec<i64>>, Status> {\r\n    Ok(Json(get_primes(db, form.into_inner()).await?))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```html\r\n<form class=\"Search\" id=\"PrimeNumberSearch\" action=\"{{https_url_for(request, 'SearchPrimeResult')}}\" target=\"PrimeNumberSearchIF\">\r\n    <input type=\"number\" name=\"start\" placeholder=\"min prime\">\r\n    <input type=\"number\" name=\"end\" placeholder=\"max prime\">\r\n    <button class=\"submit\" type=\"submit\">→</button>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @RuboGubo in https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2736#issuecomment-2002021860_\r\n            ","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2759/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
