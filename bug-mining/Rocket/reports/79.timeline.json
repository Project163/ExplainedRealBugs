the interest of safety, the implementation of `FromSegments` for `PathBuf`

I believe this is overly strict, since\r\n\r\n1. The dot-dot case (a filename of exactly `..`) is already handled.\r\n2. A single dot segment (exactly `.`) could also be valid, and just skipped.\r\n3. Lots of hidden files start with `.`, such as `.gitignore` and other config files.\r\n\r\nIn my use case I only require the third case, as I am trying to create a file browser, where the path is specified as `<path..>` and `path: PathBuf`. However, such a route cannot browse a file with a name starting with a dot, and I get a `Failed to parse 'path': BadStart('.')` error message. \r\n\r\nI can reproduce this behavior on version `0.3.6` on ArchLinux, but looking at the code I can see it is present in `master` as well.
