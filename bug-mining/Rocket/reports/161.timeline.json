I'm not super familiar with proc macros, or rocket's internals, but it looks to me like the fact that the function is used within the implementation of `From<route> for ::StaticInfo` prevents the compiler from providing an unused warning.\r\n\r\nOne way to avoid this is to implement the methods on the struct itself, rather than as a trait. This does solve this issue (with a reasonably small patch to the codegen), but I suspect it might cause other issues with more complex codebases. It does expose 1 or 2 methods to the user, in a way that doesn't feel like it should make sense, but I think this might be a reasonable trade-off.\r\n\r\nCan you provide some guidance on what issues this patch might cause?\r\n\r\nI will be submitting the patch as a pull request shortly.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/827238942/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"the10thWiz","id":16281943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjgxOTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16281943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz","html_url":"https://github.com/the10thWiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"the10thWiz","id":16281943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjgxOTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16281943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz","html_url":"https://github.com/the10thWiz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/the10thWiz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-27T01:16:07Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T01:16:07Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1620","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1620/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1620/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1620/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/pull/1620","id":868345252,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjIzODg2OTA1","number":1620,"title":"Change
