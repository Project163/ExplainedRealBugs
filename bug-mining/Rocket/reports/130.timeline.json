issue might be tangentially related to prior discussion about configuration files in issue #145._\r\n\r\nRocket looks amazing, and it improves a lot on other web frameworks I have used. I am really eager to use it for some of my own personal projects, as well as to tell my coworkers about it. :slightly_smiling_face: \r\n\r\nHowever, while reading the getting started guide, one thing surprised and confused me: The way configuration files are currently (Rocket v. 0.2.6) set up (relevant Documentation section: https://rocket.rs/guide/overview/#configuration).\r\n\r\nRight now, a `Rocket.toml` file has a section per environment. It seems that these environments are hard-coded to be `development`, `staging` and `production`. Furthermore, there is a `global` section.\r\n\r\nWhat I had expected would be that common settings could be stored in the global section, which could then be overridden by the environment-specific sections. However, instead, changes in the global section take precedence over the environment-specific settings.\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason behind this design choice? I have frequently come across situations where many configuration settings of an application are shared across environments (especially database-related, CPU-related and external-API-related settings are shared between at least the production and staging environments), with a few (e.g. hostname, email-sending settings, logging settings) being overridden per environment.\r\n\r\nThe inverse, where I wanted to override settings that are specific to each environment by one setting in the 'global' section never arose. It seems like a weird, implicit type of behaviour where part of earlier-provided configuration settings are discarded.\r\n\r\nSo, my question: What is the reason behind the current way the 'global' configuration environment section works? Is it too late to invert the way this works?\r\n\r\n_(A backwards-compatible solution would be to have a 'defaults' section that contains configuration settings that take the least precedence, which are then overridden by each of the environment-specific sections, which might then be overridden by an 'overrides' section, with 'global' being a deprecated alias for 'overrides'.)_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/290/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/290/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-19T00:19:12Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T00:19:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/704","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/704/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/704/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/704/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/704","id":340915022,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDA5MTUwMjI=","number":704,"title":"Question:

Some reasons for this:\r\n - Looking at [Rails](https://github.com/railsconfig/config) and [Django](https://medium.com/@ayarshabeer/django-best-practice-settings-file-for-multiple-environments-6d71c6966ee2#.m254m0pp9), it seems this kind of idea is widely used\r\n - Production/Staging configuration could be [encrypted](https://www.agwa.name/projects/git-crypt/) or generated from environment variables inside of Docker startup script\r\n - Most configuration options I can imagine apply to all environments with just some tweaking per environment (which is why something like `config/default.toml` is a useful concept.\r\n\r\nWe can support this a few ways (that I can see):\r\n - Allow specifying relative-from-cwd globs of configuration files.. `with_config(\"config/*.toml\")` or `with_config(\"Rocket.toml\", \"Rocket.production.toml\")`. This could default to `\"Rocket.toml\"` to keep compatibility.\r\n - Allow specifying a configuration path.. `with_config(\"config\")`. This wouldn't be able to be defaulted to `.` as it would then pick up `Cargo.toml`.\r\n\r\nMy vote is for 2 (config path) and default it to `config`.\r\n\r\nThe actual format of the files (environment tables) can stay the same or environment can be taken from the filename. I'd prefer the former as it'd be more flexible.\r\n\r\nSome more things of interest to configuration (but can be tackled later):\r\n - Ability to pull configuration from environment\r\n - Ability to pull configuration from etcd (or similar services)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnother note is that a (12-factor) configuration library would be of general use to Rust and would probably be best served as a crate that is then used by Rocket. I don't mind jumping on that if come to a consensus here. Just help me come up with a name. `config` is taken by an unfinished/unmaintained `libconfig` parser (maybe we can ask @filipegoncalves to rename it to `libconfig` or ask crates.io if unresponsive). \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor reference I *really* like how https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config just _works_.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/145/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/145/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T23:07:01Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T23:07:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/927","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/927/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/927/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/927/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/927","id":411278176,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTEyNzgxNzY=","number":927,"title":"No

out on launch for `[extras]` for production as it potentially contains sensitive information, or Rocket ought to provide a simple way to mark values for

This would allow for relatively complex configuration structures in `.toml` files, while keeping sensitive details out of git. The current recommendation of embedding TOML into environment variables is ... cumbersome.\r\n\r\nI can see two means to accomplish this:\r\n\r\n1. Override environment variables based on path\r\n2. Indicate environment variables _in_ toml\r\n\r\n1 would involve allowing variables like `ROCKET_FOO_BAR_BAZ` to change the configuration key `foo.bar.baz`. It has the advantage of simplicity, but there is some risk of key collisions. If a configuration file has the the keys `foo_bar_baz` and `foo.bar.baz`, there can be some confusion about which key should be overridden.\r\n\r\n2 would involve modifying the TOML structure to indicate which keys can be overridden by which environment variables. I'd recommend shamelessly copying [yesod`s](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod/wiki/Configuration) rather clever scheme.
