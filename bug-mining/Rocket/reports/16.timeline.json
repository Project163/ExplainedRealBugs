you for this library. I find it a joy to use, which is why I am trying to leverage it in [ferrocarril](https://github.com/lopopolo/ferrocarril).\r\n\r\n## Feature Requests\r\n\r\nI am building a [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack)-compatible Ruby web application server with Rocket similar to [Thin](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin). Rack is a set of HTTP building blocks. It defines an [environment](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/rack/rack/file/SPEC#label-The+Environment) which is a `Hash` containing information about the incoming HTTP request (see https://github.com/lopopolo/ferrocarril/issues/61).\r\n\r\nOne item in the Hash is the HTTP version. I found GH-38 which discusses exposing the HTTP Version from Hyper, but decided not to do so because there wasn't a compelling reason to expand the API surface area. I hope this is the compelling reason :wink:.\r\n\r\nRocket provides high-level HTTP building blocks that I would like to use instead of dropping down to Hyper, but building frameworks with Rocket in this case requires knowing the internal details of the HTTP request.\r\n\r\nThe other data I need to fill out the Rack environment that I'm unclear how to access includes:\r\n\r\n- server name\r\n- server port\r\n- url scheme (http vs https)\r\n\r\nThis feature needs to exist inside of Rocket because Rocket is hiding this information from the underlying Hyper request.\r\n\r\nThe right answer here might be that I need to use Hyper directly, and if that is the case I'm happy to do so. Thanks again! 😄
