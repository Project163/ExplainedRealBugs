Cookie paths weren't clear to me so I tried to set a cookie in \"/cookies/set\" and print it in \"/cookies/get\". This doesn't work because the path set by `Cookies::new()` in this case is \"/cookies/set\", so the cookie isn't accessible from \"/cookies/get\".\r\n    Adding a hint or warning that the path you try to read the cookie from must start with the same path you set it from might be helpful for newcomers.\r\n\r\n- [x] https://rocket.rs/v0.4/guide/responses/#wrapping\r\n    ``` \r\n    #[get(\"/\")] \r\n    fn json() -> content::Json<&'static str> { \r\n        content::Json(\"{ 'hi': 'world' }\")  \r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    Results in \"SyntaxError: JSON.parse: expected property name or '}' at line 1 column 3 of the JSON data\" in Firefox. JSON seems to require double quotes according to https://www.json.org/json-en.html.\r\n    replacing \r\n        `\"{ 'hi': 'world' }\"`\r\n    with\r\n       ` r#\"{ \"hi\": \"world\" }\"#`\r\n    or\r\n        `\"{ \\\"hi\\\": \\\"world\\\" }\"`\r\n    solved the issue for me.\r\n\r\n- [x] https://rocket.rs/v0.4/guide/responses/#errors\r\n    \"Responders may fail; they need not always generate a response.\" \r\n    Is this correct? English isn't my first language. To me it seems like there something missing. \r\n    \"Responders may fail; they don't always need to generate a response.\"\r\n    This seems correct to me, but I'm not sure if some meaning is lost.\r\n    \r\n\r\n- [ ] https://rocket.rs/v0.4/guide/testing/#testing\r\n    `let client = Client::new(rocket).expect(\"valid rocket instance\");`\r\n    Shouldn't an error description be used with expect? Something like\r\n    `let client = Client::new(rocket).expect(\"Could not create valid rocket instance\");`?","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1356/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
