The version of Rocket you're using. Ensure it's the latest, if possible.\r\n\r\n         0.5-rc\r\n\r\n  2. The operating system (distribution and version) where the issue occurs.\r\n\r\n         NixOS 21.05.906.cedcf2565c6\r\n\r\n  3. A brief description of the bug that includes:\r\n    * The nature of the bug.\r\n    * When the bug occurs.\r\n    * What you expected vs. what actually happened.\r\n\r\n     https://docs.rs/rocket_sync_db_pools/0.1.0-rc.1/rocket_sync_db_pools/attr.database.html says that macro database generates two methods, but it actually generates three, see https://docs.rs/rocket_sync_db_pools_codegen/0.1.0-rc.1/src/rocket_sync_db_pools_codegen/database.rs.html.\r\n\r\n     This bug always occurs. I expected the documentation to say that the `run` method is being generated.\r\n\r\n  4. How you uncovered the bug. Short, reproducible tests are especially useful.\r\n\r\n      By trying to figure out where `run` method comes from.\r\n\r\n  5. Ideas, if any, about what Rocket is doing incorrectly.\r\n\r\n      Documentation should be updated to mention that it creates three methods.","closed_by":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1704/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
