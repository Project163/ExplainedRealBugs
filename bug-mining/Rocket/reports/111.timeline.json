tripped me up too. It is really nice when examples are fully copy/paste-able\r\n\r\nThis is the error that you get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cargo run\r\n   Compiling hello-rocket v0.1.0 (/var/www/vhosts/rust/hello-rocket)\r\nerror[E0412]: cannot find type `RawStr` in this scope\r\n  --> src/main.rs:16:17\r\n``` \r\n\r\nSearching for this error returns mostly cryptic results and certainly no direct answer. Hopefully in the future Googling for the error will pick up this issue. The Google results do bring up https://api.rocket.rs/rocket/http/struct.RawStr.html which correctly suggests the `use rocket::http::RawStr;` but its frustrating to have to do the run around when trying to get things to work. \r\n\r\nAlso people learning Rust at the same time as Rocket may well not know about the `use` syntax which makes it doubly hard. This shouldn't really be a problem for Rocket, but I certainly am using Rocket as a first example of a more extensive Rust project and so I'm less familiar with Rust syntax. I have at least already been reading through the \"Programming Rust\" book but I expect there will be others who haven't.  So where as there is no expectation that Rocket should have to explain fundamentals to users it's nice if the examples do try to be more explicit.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/487387933/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ianchanning","id":233318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzMxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/233318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning","html_url":"https://github.com/ianchanning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/487392927","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/432#issuecomment-487392927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/432","id":487392927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzM5MjkyNw==","user":{"login":"ianchanning","id":233318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzMxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/233318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning","html_url":"https://github.com/ianchanning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ianchanning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-28T16:12:14Z","updated_at":"2019-04-28T16:12:14Z","body":"I've also seen that the documentation has been updated to include `use std::path::PathBuf;` in the [Multiple Segments](https://rocket.rs/v0.4/guide/requests/#multiple-segments) section.
