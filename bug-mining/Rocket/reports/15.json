of the box, Rocket does not correctly handle handlebars partials.\r\n\r\nSee an example handlebars template:\r\n\r\n```handlebars\r\n{{> common/header }}\r\n<main> ... </main>\r\n{{> common/footer }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI currently have a work-around where I write a little hacky-boilerplate before I launch rocket:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let empty = HashMap::<String, String>::with_capacity(0);\r\n    Template::render(\"common/header\", &empty);\r\n    Template::render(\"common/footer\", &empty);\r\n\r\n    rocket::ignite().mount(\"/\", routes![...]).launch();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works by re-purposing the `render()` function to register the partials in the `HANDLEBARS` static variable.\r\n\r\nIf you can describe your ideal way of fixing this issue, I'd be happy to implement a fix and open a pull request.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/122/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
