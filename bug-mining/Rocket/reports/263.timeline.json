I'd love the help! I imagine that such a section would be composed of at least two subsections:\r\n\r\n  1. Deploying on a VPS (using NGINX as a reverse proxy)\r\n  2. Deploying on Heroku\r\n\r\nThat will likely cover 75%+ of use cases, is my guess. Maybe there's a third, popular deployment strategy? In any case, I'd be more than happy to review an addition of such a section to the guide.
