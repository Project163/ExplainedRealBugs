I don't know why diesel was originally chosen for the example, but unfortunately I think it's a uniquely bad example for the documentation today for two reasons:\r\n\r\nFirst, in my opinion, diesel's own getting started guide (\"Get Started\" on <http://diesel.rs/>) is pretty much mandatory reading in order to use diesel at all. Most idiomatic diesel code relies heavily on code generated by the `table!` macro, which is difficult to see without going through that guide.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that the `diesel` CLI tool assumes a few things about your project: 1) you have a single database, located at `DATABASE_URL` - in contrast to rocket's support for database pools, which allows for multiple database connections in the configuration file. And 2) the CLI generates a file, `schema.rs`, that requires a `#[macro_use] extern crate diesel;` and a `mod schema;` in your crate root.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that said, I see a few ways to improve the documentation. We could make the changes I suggested in <https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/950#issuecomment-515778753>, if they would have helped clear up any of your confusion. If not, what would have? Another option might be to replace diesel with something else, such as `rusqlite`, in that part of the documentation.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/706753802/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3863994604,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM4NjM5OTQ2MDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/3863994604","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-11T19:11:05Z","label":{"name":"docs","color":"d4c5f9"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/706781908","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1447#issuecomment-706781908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1447","id":706781908,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjc4MTkwOA==","user":{"login":"Owez","id":30081702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDgxNzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30081702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Owez","html_url":"https://github.com/Owez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Owez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Owez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Owez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Owez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Owez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Owez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Owez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Owez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Owez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-11T23:05:31Z","updated_at":"2020-10-11T23:06:13Z","body":"Having a simpler database showcased would help a bunch but could also be beneficial to generally expand the database section to give the user a simple, most likely sqlite-based solution to show a simple database setup; and then in another subheading provide briefing to diesel (which may be used most commonly in production), with external links to more diesel getting started tutorials externally for further reading.
