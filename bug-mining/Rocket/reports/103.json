Rocket Version: 0.4.1\r\n- Question: `non_snake_case` warning for the rocket generated route parameter, e.g. `__rocket_param__id`.\r\n\r\n## Actual Code:\r\n\r\n``` rust\r\n// The normal `check` route requiring `AdminUser` to be presented\r\n#[get(\"/admin/data/check?<id>\")]\r\npub fn check(_user: AdminUser, id: String) -> Result<Template, Redirect> { ... }\r\n\r\n// The `check` route where `AdminUser` doesn't exist, simply redirect to \"admin/login\"\r\n#[get(\"/admin/data/check?<_id>\", rank=2)]\r\npub fn check_fail(_id: String) -> Redirect { Redirect::to(\"/admin/login\") }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the warning generated by rust:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwarning: variable `__rocket_param__id` should have a snake case name\r\n  --> src/routes/pages/admin/data/check.rs:34:19\r\n   |\r\n34 | pub fn check_fail(_id: String) -> Redirect {\r\n   |                   ^^^ help: convert the identifier to snake case: `__rocket_param_id`\r\n   |\r\n   = note: #[warn(non_snake_case)] on by default\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, I'm trying to implement `check_fail` backing up the normal `check` route when there's no `AdminUser` presented. (I think this is almost identical to one of the example usage of `route` so I guess I don't need to elaborate a ton on this.)\r\n\r\nOf course I don't need the parameter `id` in my `check_fail` function because I'm just redirecting it to `/admin/login` (as there's no `AdminUser` presented). But I still need the `?<id>` part in the route because otherwise this wouldn't match the original admin route. If I use `id` here then rust compiler will be yelling at me saying that \"you are not using this `id` in the function, so you should change it to `_id`\". Ok now I change the parameter name to `_id`, and rust is complaining that the rocket generated parameter name `__rocket_param__id` not matching the snake case (because there are two consecutive `_` before `id`.)\r\n\r\nUsually this kind of unused variable problem will be fixed just by prepending `_`. But right now even if I add `_` it wouldn't get through the warning. Rocket also does not allow me to use an ignored `_` as the variable name. So what do we usually do in this case?\r\n\r\n**Potential Solution**: Add a check on Rocket's side checking whether a parameter starts with an underscore (`_`). If it is then you don't append a trailing `_` at the end of `__rocket_param`. So if my variable is called `_id`, the generated variable name will be `__rocket_param_id` instead of `__rocket_param__id`. Therefore the rust compiler will not complain about the snake case violation.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1003/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
