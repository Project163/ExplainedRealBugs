However, I am not aware of any other preload list that relies on the preload directive. I think the best solution depends on what the intent of this option is. I think clarifying the documentation to address this is necessary.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is based on the assumption that this option is intended to conform to the requirements of the preload list at https://hstspreload.org:\r\n\r\n> serving this directive on a subdomain will be excluded for the preload list as it would need to be served at the hosts domain\r\n\r\nYes, I think the preload list directive is only useful if you are serving the header at the hosts domain, but it was not entirely clear to me what this means. I am unsure if, for example, one can add `example.co.uk` to the preload list.\r\n\r\n> running that on a subdomain will only give you the opportunity to have hsts enabled on further subdomains (my-page.example.com => *.my-page.example.com)\r\n\r\nYou cannot get onto the preload list without the `includeSubDomains` directive, so even though it is a separate directive, it is a prerequisite to use `preload` effectively. Thus, it is not possible to have HSTS disabled on subdomains and also be on the preload list. These are conflicting intentions.\r\n\r\n> I don’t see a direct disadvantage to have it but would love to see a flag, in some cases http traffic is still needed on subdomains, would default to true with an optional Boolean to set it to false. Basically an opt-out\r\n\r\nAs the preload list exists now and has for some time, `includeSubDomains` is a requirement, and while I agree that a flag would certainly add configurability, I think it is only useful in the case that the preload list requirements change or if another preload list with different requirements is desired. Whether this is worth doing or not is certainly debatable.\r\n\r\nI think right now, the current expectation is for compatibility with the Chromium preload list form, and as such, the current header is a bug. Maybe adding a flag would be better as an additional feature?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1006832266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Soham3-1415","id":17441466,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDQxNDY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17441466?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soham3-1415","html_url":"https://github.com/Soham3-1415","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soham3-1415/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soham3-1415/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soham3-1415/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soham3-1415/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soham3-1415/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soham3-1415/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soham3-1415/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soham3-1415/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Soham3-1415/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1006919420","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2049#issuecomment-1006919420","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2049","id":1006919420,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzqMt848BF78","user":{"login":"somehowchris","id":38954618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTU0NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38954618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris","html_url":"https://github.com/somehowchris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/somehowchris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-06T20:40:05Z","updated_at":"2022-01-06T20:40:38Z","body":"* Host domain means `example.com`.
