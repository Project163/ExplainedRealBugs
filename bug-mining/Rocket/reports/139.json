Is there a need for `Template::custom()` to take `Fn` instead of `FnOnce`?\r\n\r\nI would like to initialise some values and do error handling outside of the closure, then move a value inside the closure and use it there. Unfortunately, this is not possible, since the type is not `Copy` nor `Clone`.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n  // not copy or clone\r\n  let something = do_some_initialisation();\r\n\r\n  rocket::ignite()\r\n    .attach(Template::custom(move |engines| {\r\n      // move `something` in here\r\n    })\r\n    .launch();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is currently impossible due to the constraints of `Fn`.\r\n\r\nIf `Template::custom()` can take an `FnOnce`, I'd be happy to PR such a change. :)","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1064/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
