are very useful in structures that represents forms, particularly as parses of `radio` and `option` fields. For example, if the HTML forms contains:\n\n``` html\n<label>Select:\n  <select name=\"select\">\n    <option value=\"a\">Value A</option>\n    <option value=\"b\" selected>Value B</option>\n    <option value=\"c\">Value C</option>\n  </select>\n</label>\n```\n\nIt would be nice to parse the `select` field as an enum:\n\n``` rust\nenum SelectValue {\n    A, B, C\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `\"a\" or \"A\"` would parse as `SelectValue::A`, etc.\n\nAt present, Rocket does not support deriving `FromFormValue` for any types. It would be nice to extend Rocket to automatically implement `FromFormValue` to cover enums with nullary fields with an implementation as shown above.\n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/16/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/16/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
