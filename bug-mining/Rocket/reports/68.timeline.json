#163.\r\n\r\nThere are a few general aspects I would like to get feedback on:\r\n- The dependency on `notify` in Cargo.toml. it would be nice if this is enabled only when both `debug_assertions` and `feature=\"templates\"` are active, i.e. `target.'cfg(all(debug_assertions, feature=\"templates\"))'.dependencies`. In its current form, `notify` is a dependency for all debug builds but remains unused. I will continue to search for a solution to this, but it seems cargo does not support all the cfg() options that rust does, at least not in some places.\r\n  - Side note: what about making this a separate feature, instead of being based on build type? That would make this bullet point obsolete, and allow consumers to control template reloading independently of the build type.\r\n  - EDIT (2018-04-15): Discussions on IRC have led to keeping notify as a dependency in all debug builds, and also adding a new default feature (perhaps \"`template_reload`\"). The template reload behavior would now happen in `cfg(all(debug_assertions, feature=\"template_reload\"))`.\r\n- ~~The mutex workaround in `custom()`. The `on_attach` callback is `Fn()`, so it must use a workaround such as interior mutability and `Option.take()` in order to move `f` out of its environment. The interior mutability must also be thread-safe due to the `Send + Sync + 'static` bounds, thus the choice of `Mutex`. #522 would make this workaround unnecessary, but that issue is nowhere near trivial to fix and might necessitate some amount of change to the entire Fairings system.~~\r\n  - EDIT (2018-04-12): Changed approach by using a new `Fairing` type, so this point is no longer relevant.\r\n- ~~The `ContextManager` wrapper. Current consumers of `Context` assume they can access the fields of `Context` (that is, they have a `Deref<Target=Context>`, for example `RwLockReadGuard<Context>`).~~\r\n- ~~This is a difficult feature to write automated tests for, and likely unreliable. Not all filesystems on all platforms are guaranteed to have reliable filesystem notification, and failing a CI build because of something nondeterministic like change notification timing would be unfortunate.~~\r\n    - EDIT (2018-07-10): There is a test now, and it strives to be reliable on CI. Hopefully it actually is.\r\n- User-facing and internal

version: 0.4.2\r\nSteps I've taken to answer the question myself: looked at the source and mentally examined the needs of such a closure.\r\nDocumentation I believe should include an answer:

Is there a need for `Template::custom()` to take `Fn` instead of `FnOnce`?\r\n\r\nI would like to initialise some values and do error handling outside of the closure, then move a value inside the closure and use it there.
