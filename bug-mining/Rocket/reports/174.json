More importantly, the conversion is directly in the request processing path, so it effects the performance of every request:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/blob/9671115796e42865eaebd020ac27542802027b02/core/lib/src/request/request.rs#L887-L893\r\n\r\nInstead of our entirely custom `HeaderMap` type, we should consider leveraging the work in `http` by using an `http::HeaderMap` internally, wrapping it in a custom type to preserve our documentation and interoperability with the rest of Rocket's types. The `http::HeaderMap` allows customization of the internal value; for `hyper`, this is [`http::header::HeaderValue`](https://docs.rs/http/0.2.2/http/header/struct.HeaderValue.html). Unfortunately, unlike Rocket's header map, this does not allow borrowing header values of a particular lifetime; all values are heap-allocated. The same issue occurs with header names. What's more, because values are stored as bytes in `HeaderMap` (a good thing), retrieving them as strings requires a UTF-8 check (a bad thing). The map also does not preserve case which is known to cause issues downstream.\r\n\r\nIn summary, there are _at least_ the following road-blocks to using an `http::HeaderMap` internally:\r\n\r\n  * Header names and values cannot borrow.\r\n  * Retrieving a value as a string requires a UTF-8 check every time.\r\n  * The map does not preserve header name casing; it should still be case-insensitive during comparison.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1498/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1498/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
