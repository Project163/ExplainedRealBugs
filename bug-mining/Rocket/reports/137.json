is a [known limitation](https://rocket.rs/v0.4/guide/requests/#field-renaming) of using reserved identifier, e.g. `type` or `struct` as a parameter name.\r\n\r\nAs of [Rust 1.30 one could use raw identifier](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/edition-guide/rust-2018/module-system/raw-identifiers.html) making it possible to use those reserved keywords as variable name, e.g. \r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet r#type = \"foo\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like it to be possible to use those, e.g. in this minimal example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]\r\n#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;\r\n\r\n#[get(\"/<type>\")]\r\npub fn offers_get(r#type: String) -> String {\r\n    unimplemented!()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis current results in the following error:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nerror: custom attribute panicked\r\n --> src/main.rs:4:1\r\n  |\r\n4 | #[get(\"/<type>\")]\r\n  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  |\r\n  = help: message: `\"__rocket_param_r#type\"` is not a valid identifier\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Serde has a detection for raw identifier and just strips them](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/blob/fea4e8e5b69bf44c051066aa9621f80144275992/serde_derive/src/dummy.rs#L26-L32).
