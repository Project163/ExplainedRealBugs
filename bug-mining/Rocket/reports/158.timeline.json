So it is heavily dependent on what the fairing does. If a fairing needs \"veto power\" over application startup or is truly necessary in order for the application to work it should be in `on_attach`. If the fairing needs a \"fully finished\" Rocket instance to inspect it should be in `on_launch`.\r\n\r\n> So, yes there is no real use case of an `on_launch` test but it also does not cost anything to add it, right?\r\n\r\nI don't think it's mentioned explicitly in the docs, but launch fairings can currently rely on the fact that Rocket is actually listening for traffic and we would be breaking that with this change.
