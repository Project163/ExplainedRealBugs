🔧 Configured for debug.\r\nWARN :rocket::launch_ - address: 127.0.0.1\r\nWARN :rocket::launch_ - port: 8000\r\nWARN :rocket::launch_ - workers: 8\r\n...\r\nWARN :rocket::launch - 🛰  Routes:\r\n...\r\n```\r\n(note that the format is custom because of my log implementation)\r\nThe `WARN` is the `record.level()` so all warning added by `log::warn!(...)`.\r\nIn Rocket 0.4.x these messages where printed using `log::info!(...)`.\r\nThis was desirable as now my warning logs would be full or warnings even though nothing was wrong.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nAny example will do.\r\nIn order to show the log level you can use the code below (applied this to `examples/hello`)\r\nAdd to toml: `log = \"0.4.14\"`\r\nCode:\r\n```rust\r\nuse log::{Record, Level, Metadata};\r\n\r\nstruct SimpleLogger;\r\n\r\nstatic LOGGER: SimpleLogger = SimpleLogger;\r\n\r\n#[launch]\r\nfn rocket() -> _ {\r\n    log::set_logger(&LOGGER).expect(\"Could not setup logger\");\r\n    log::set_max_level(log::LevelFilter::Info);\r\n    rocket::build()\r\n        .mount(\"/\", routes![hello])\r\n        .mount(\"/hello\", routes![world, mir])\r\n        .mount(\"/wave\", routes![wave])\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl log::Log for SimpleLogger {\r\n    fn enabled(&self, metadata: &Metadata) -> bool {\r\n        metadata.level() <= Level::Info\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn log(&self, record: &Record) {\r\n        if self.enabled(record.metadata()) {\r\n            println!(\"{} - {}\", record.level(), record.args());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn flush(&self) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nLog messages that are expected should be marked as `info` not as `warning`.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n - OS Distribution and Kernel: Linux\r\n - Rocket Version: 0.5.0-rc.1\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1828/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
