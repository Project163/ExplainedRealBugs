Questions\r\n\r\nHello, I have a question (or if not possible a feature request).\r\n\r\nIs it possible to serve static files from multiple directories behind the same endpoint. E.g. I want to serve \r\n- the directory `./spa/`\r\n- the directory `./css/`\r\n- the directory `./images/`\r\n- All from the same URL `http://url/static/\r\n\r\nIn `express.js` (see [Documentation](http://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/serve-static.html) section _Multiple Roots_) you can configure multiple directories using their fallthrough mechanism:\r\n\r\n```js\r\napp.use('/static', express.static('./css'));\r\napp.use('/static', express.static('./spa'));\r\napp.use('/static', express.static('./images'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn `rocket.rs` I am not allowed to configure multiple endpoints because of route collisions. So the following will fail:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nserver.mount(\"/static\", StaticFiles::from(\"./spa\"))\r\n      .mount(\"/static\", StaticFiles::from(\"./css\"))\r\n      .mount(\"/static\", StaticFiles::from(\"./images\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great if `StatifFiles::from` of `StaticFiles::new` would accept a vector of directories:\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nserver.mount(\"/static\", StaticFiles::new(vec![\r\n  \"./spa\",\r\n  \"./css\",\r\n  \"./images\"])\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny questions _must_ include:\r\n\r\n  1. The version of Rocket this question is based on, if any.\r\n```toml\r\nrocket = \"0.4.6\"\r\n[dependencies.rocket_contrib]\r\nversion = \"0.4.6\"\r\ndefault-features = false\r\nfeatures = [\"handlebars_templates\", \"json\", \"serve\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n  2. What steps you've taken to answer the question yourself.\r\nI've done online research and looked in the docs, but couldn't find anything.\r\n\r\n  3. What documentation you believe should include an answer to this question.\r\nEither a link to an example, an example, or an explanation on how to achieve this. \r\n\r\nThanks, and great work!
