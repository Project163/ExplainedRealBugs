I'm upgrading one of my applications from Rocket 0.4 to 0.5.  I am having a little trouble converting my custom `FromFormValue` to `FromFormField`.\r\n\r\nMy old code is roughly like this:\r\n```\r\nimpl<'r,> FromFormValue<'r> for MyType<'r> {\r\n  type Error = OnlineErrorResponse;\r\n  fn from_form_value(param: &'r RawStr) -> Result<Self,OnlineErrorResponse> {\r\n...\r\nenum OnlineErrorResponse {...}\r\nimpl Respoonder for OnlineErrorResponse { ... set status according to the error ... etc. }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith Rocket 0.5 I'm to `impl FromFormField` which means I have to return a `rocket::form::Error`.  The `rocket::form::Error` does not seem to have a way to record the desired HTTP status response, and hence control the return value from `form::Error::status`.\r\n\r\n(Please forgive me if I have missed a way to do this; I looked in the api docs for `form::Error` and `FromFormField` and also the relevant-seeming sections of the guide, searching both for \"form\" and \"error\".)\r\n\r\nI want to control the http status because I am using a form guard in circumstances where I sometimes want to say `404` if the guard fails, and sometimes even `403`.\r\n\r\nI don't think this can be fixed easily without a breaking change to at least one of `rocket::form::Error` or `ErrorKind` so it would be good to fix this before Rocket 0.5.0.\r\n\r\nI think the best fix is probably to add a new variant to `ErrorKind`, or to expand `Custom`, something like this:\r\n```\r\n+ Custom(Option<Status>, Box<dyn Error + Send + 'static>)\r\n- Custom(Box<dyn Error + Send + 'static>)\r\n```\r\nor this:\r\n```\r\n+ CustomStatus(Status, Box<dyn Error + Send + 'static>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wonder if `ErroKind` ought to be marked `#[non_exhaustive]` for future-proofing.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1694/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
