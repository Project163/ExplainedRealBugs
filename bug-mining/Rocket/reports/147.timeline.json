absolutely cannot special-case what syntax means based on the type of arguments because we do not have type information in the procedural macro. Sure, `Option` is probably `std::option::Option`, but what if there's a rogue:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntype Option<T> = my::Option<T>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat being said, we could have the `PathBuf` be empty or otherwise fail (which can be caught by `Optional`) if the path is empty. This would mean that while `/<a>` and `/<b>/<path..>` don't collide today, they would, without explicit ranking, collide in the future. On the other hand, `/` and `/<a..>` would continue to not collide due to their default rankings. As such, I don't see a downside towards accepting this request. @jebrosen, do you have any thoughts? Are there consequences to this change that I'm forgetting?\r\n\r\nNote that these arguments _do not_ apply to singular path segments.
