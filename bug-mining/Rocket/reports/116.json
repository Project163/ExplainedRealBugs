The Rocket logs show this:\r\n```\r\nGET /static text/html:\r\n    => Matched: GET /static [10]\r\n    => Outcome: Success\r\n    => Response succeeded.\r\nGET /app.js:\r\n    => Error: No matching routes for GET /app.js.\r\n    => Warning: Responding with 404 Not Found catcher.\r\n    => Response succeeded.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected the page to load correctly, whether it was requested with `static/` or `static`. Actually, it only loads corectly if `static/` is used; if `static` is used all relative URLs are interpreted relative to the parent directory rather than the static directory.\r\n\r\nI would prefer Rocket to respond to a request for `static` with a 301 redirect to `static/`. In general, if the request does not have a trailing slash but the matching file is a directory, issue a redirect to the request URI with a trailing slash appended.\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1198/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
