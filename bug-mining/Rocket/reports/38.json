The ideal, of course, is 100%. This is particularly important for examples as they can serve as a measure of understanding for new users. Let's get to 100%.\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of all of the examples. Those checked off have a complete test suite, while those that aren't do not.\r\n\r\n- [X] config\r\n- [X] content_types\r\n- [X] cookies\r\n- [X] errors\r\n- [x] extended_validation\r\n- [X] fairings\r\n- [x] form_kitchen_sink\r\n- [X] forms\r\n- [X] from_request\r\n- [X] handlebars_templates\r\n- [X] hello_alt_methods\r\n- [X] hello_person\r\n- [X] hello_ranks\r\n- [X] hello_world\r\n- [X] json\r\n- [X] managed_queue\r\n- [X] manual_routes\r\n- [X] optional_redirect\r\n- [X] optional_result\r\n- [X] pastebin\r\n- [X] query_params\r\n- [x] raw_upload\r\n- [X] redirect\r\n- [X] state\r\n- [X] static_files\r\n- [x] stream\r\n- [x] state\r\n- [X] testing\r\n- [X] todo\r\n\r\nThis is a great opportunity for those looking to contribute. If you'd like to write a test suite for an example, please comment with the example's name and expected time of completion. The example will be annotated as \"in progress\". This will prevent overlapping work. Use the existing test suites as a basis for writing new tests; consistency is important.\r\n\r\nP.S: While working on the test suites, be sure to record your experience with the testing library. I'd like for testing in Rocket to be a simple, straightforward, and enjoyable experience. Your feedback is essential to making this happen.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/62/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/62/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
