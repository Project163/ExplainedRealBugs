HTTPS is increasingly a requirement even in development, for features like Service Worker.\r\n\r\nNginx and HA proxy are great for complicated use cases, but for simple apps, they introduce complexity and friction to building and set up for both development and production.  Proxy servers require more set up (especially cross-platform like Windows), can't be version managed in Cargo.toml dependencies, and could add unnecessary bloat.  They also add more non-Rust code to the app.  By now we've already drank the Rust-safety Kool-aid, so we don't want that.\r\n\r\nMy use-case is that I've been playing around with rust a little bit, and I've been asked to give a short workshop intro, but it requires HTTPS-only web features.  I'd love to be able to use Rocket, and have `rustup` installation and `cargo run` the only required steps to get people started, but adding in nginx greatly complicates the start of a project.

Outside of **development** or **demoing** there is no use-case I can think for the app using SSL itself.\r\n\r\nI would be in favor of actually automatically listening on both HTTP _and_ HTTPS via an automatically generated self-signed certificate.

You have a single server running your application and would want this so you don't have to configure nginx on the same server and deal with port binding.\r\n\r\n - First off.. even if you are being cheap.. please get 2 servers and use a basic load balancer for an app that is in production which in that case the SSL gateway is at the load balancer and the individual app servers are behind a firewall.
