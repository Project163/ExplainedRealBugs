I need this feature, my use case is trying to create a webdav server in my app that can share my application contacts with phones/computers. WebDav makes use of a few custom methods like 'PROPFIND' & 'MKCOL' that i would need to be able to use. \r\n\r\nI have found #619 but after reading the comments left by @SergioBenitez I'm not sure how to move forward with this. I agree that putting a String in Method is not the best idea, but i don't see a way to possibly use a &'static str there. \r\n\r\nMy idea is to create a feature gate  (maybe named webdav_methods) that when enabled would add the webdav related http methods to the Methods enum. I don't know much about the internals of the route macros (route, get, post, etc.) but i don't think it would make much sense to provide a macro for these methods if they could be created with just the `#[route(MKCOL, ...)]` macro.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of all the Extension Methods would be necessary for this feature\r\n\r\n- COPY\r\n- LOCK\r\n- MKCOL\r\n- MOVE\r\n- PROPFIND\r\n- PROPPATCH\r\n-
