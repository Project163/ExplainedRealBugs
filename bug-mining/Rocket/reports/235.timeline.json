In your examples, the paths are `/foo` and `/foo/`, neither of which are empty. I haven't read the entire RFC but at a glance it doesn't seem to prescribe a normalization between `/foo` and `/foo/` or even treating them as equivalent (though [section 6.2.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-6.2.4) notes that redirecting from one to the other may cause clients to treat them as equivalent in the future). So not normalizing here is not only something that appears in the wild but also compliant, and one more reason to make this change. (Though it may be confusing for users, but that's not our problem if I understand correctly that this issue is only about external URIs and not about Rocket's router.)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1500081017/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fenhl","id":641386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MTM4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/641386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenhl","html_url":"https://github.com/fenhl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenhl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenhl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenhl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenhl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenhl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenhl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenhl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenhl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenhl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1500437797","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2512#issuecomment-1500437797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2512","id":1500437797,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzqMt85Zbt0l","user":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-07T16:25:50Z","updated_at":"2023-04-07T16:25:50Z","body":"> This is not what that means. “Path” here means the entire path, not an individual segment.\r\n\r\nYou're absolutely right.

similar question has been asked before (https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/702) but only asked about a single path.)\r\n\r\nHow can I redirect any path containing a trailing slash to the

Manually writing a redirect for every existing path that could contain a trailing slash is generally unfeasible. I would like to match all paths that contain a trailing slash and perform a 301 redirect to the same path, but without the slash.\r\n\r\nIncluding the trailing slash in the request route like so:\r\n```\r\n#[ get( \"/<path..>/\" ) ]\r\nfn catch_all( path: PathBuf ) -> Redirect {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthrows the error `paths cannot contain empty segments` which is understandable. Is it possible to match all paths with a trailing slash, and if so, how?\r\n\r\nI'm aware I could do this with a proxy server like nginx, but I'm working on a fairly small project and would like to do it in app if possible.\r\n\r\nUsing Rocket 0.4.2\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1212/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
