This is the incorrect response code, unless deserialization failed due to malformed JSON. It is clearly defined in [RFC 2616](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-65) as \"The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications.\". For failures due to missing fields, unrecognized fields, fields of the wrong type, or pretty much any failure that isn't the result of the body being syntactically incorrect for the declared content-type, [`422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4918#page-78) should be used instead.
