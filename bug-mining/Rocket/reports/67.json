Ensure it's the latest, if possible.**\r\n 0.3.5\r\n  2. **The operating system (distribution and version) where the issue occurs.**\r\nArch Linux\r\n\r\n  3. **A brief description of the bug that includes:**\r\nWhen setting a flash message it is only read on the next request when reflected from the request.\r\n\r\n  4. **How you uncovered the bug. Short, reproducible tests are especially useful.**\r\nI set a flash message in my handler, and extract in a fairing to feed it to my templates. It only shows when redirecting or on next page load.\r\n\r\nThe exact timeline:\r\n\r\n- Users goes to `GET /login`\r\n- Submits incomplete form to `POST /login`\r\n- This sets a flash message telling them there is an error\r\n- It then directly renders the login form, it shows no flash message\r\n- User then goes to `/` and then the flash shows and gets deleted.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n**Ideas, if any, about what Rocket is doing incorrectly.**\r\nIt should be available to fairings after the handler ran, so that they can use it and stop the cookie from being set.\r\n\r\n## General Comments\r\n\r\nThe logs currently show:\r\n```\r\n    => Flash: setting message: error:Something didn't seem right, please retry in a moment.\r\n    => Flash: attemping to retrieve message.\r\n```\r\nBut it doesn't find it.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/512/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
