1. When you use a method annotation such as get, it also generates the option route support, it just ensures that all the method is checked for guards and will match the request, it doesn't actually call it.\r\n\r\nCan you rephrase this? What does \"that all the method is checked for guards\" mean?\r\n\r\n\r\n> 2. Just enhance the router logic so when an Options request comes in, it checks it against all existing routes, doing exactly what it does now, but doesn't actually call the matched fn.\r\n\r\nThis is an expensive operation, but it would be fairly straightforward to implement outside of Rocket if we exposed just a bit more. There is `Route::matches()` that can be used to check if a route matches a given request. All of the routes can be retrieved via `Rocket::routes()`. So writing a fairing that does this if we expose `Request::rocket()` and `Route::matches()` would be rather straightforward:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nif this is not an options or if this was already handled {\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet original = request.method();\r\n\r\nlet allow = &[Get, Put, Post, Delete, ..].iter()\r\n    .filter(|method| {\r\n        request.set_method(method);\r\n        request.rocket()\r\n            .routes()\r\n            .any(|r| r.matches(request))\r\n    })\r\n    .map(|method| method.as_str())\r\n    .join(\", \");\r\n\r\nrequest.set_method(original);\r\n\r\n/* set the response */\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeas on whether we should expose these two API elements, @jebrosen? My only concern is wanting to change `matches()` in a point release, but I suppose if we change matches we change routing, so it would have to be backwards compatible anyway.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/803220275/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4484967995,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDQ4NDk2Nzk5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/4484967995","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-20T01:44:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4484968000,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ0ODQ5NjgwMDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/4484968000","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-20T01:44:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/803460977","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1561#issuecomment-803460977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1561","id":803460977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMzQ2MDk3Nw==","user":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-20T20:47:05Z","updated_at":"2021-03-20T20:47:05Z","

So, on this point I'm less sure.\n\nI don't believe I've purposefully avoided exposing `&Rocket`. My thinking here is two-fold: 1) we already expose much of `&Rocket` via many methods like `config()` and `shutdown()`, and 2) it is already possible to access everything in `&Rocket` in request contexts by cloning and putting the item in managed state. The only additional items we would be exposing directly are `figment()`, `catchers()`, and `routes()`. Exposing `figment()` may not be ideal as it may encourage config lookups at run-time, but exposing the latter two seems like a win. What's more, I think `request.rocket().config()` is more illustrative than `request.config()`, which seems to imply that the request configuration, not the application configuration, is being retrieved; a similar effect can be seen with the rest of the methods.\n\nIn all, exposing `&Rocket` directly seems like an ergonomic, functionality, and maintainability win with little downside.
