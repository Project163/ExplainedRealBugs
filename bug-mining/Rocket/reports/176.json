For example, `FromFormValue::default` is not implemented for `String`, but a default value might still be desired.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm)]\r\nstruct Form {\r\n    #[form(default)]\r\n    value: String, // uses the Default::default impl\r\n    #[form(default = def_username)]\r\n    username: String, // uses the Default::default impl\r\n    #[form(default = Vec::new)]\r\n    fields: Vec<i32>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn def_username() -> String {\r\n    \"anonymous\".to_string()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt may be useful to reimplement the full set of field attributes as specified in https://serde.rs/field-attrs.html (that is, only the fields that are relevant for Deserialize), so that people can switch from JSON using serde::Deserialize to forms using FromForm as a drop-in replacement.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is sometimes desired to have the FromForm implementation fail even when a type has a `FromFormValue::default` implemenation.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm)]\r\nstruct Form {\r\n    #[form(default = \"save_humanity\")]\r\n    save_humanity: bool, // should default to true\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn save_humanity() -> bool { true }\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1536/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
