While all of Rocket's built-in and `contrib` data guards enforce a limit, Rocket doesn't _require_ enforcing such a limit, allowing incorrect user code to be written. We should prevent this by requiring, via the type system, data to be read with a limit. A possible re-worked API for `Data` and `DataStream` may be:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl Data {\r\n    fn open(limit: usize) -> DataStream;\r\n    fn peek(&self) -> &[u8];\r\n    fn peek_complete(&self) -> bool;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl DataStream {\r\n    fn stream_to<W: Write>(self, writer: &mut W) -> io::Result<u64>;\r\n    fn stream_to_file<P: AsRef<Path>>(self, path: P) -> io::Result<u64>;\r\n    fn stream_to_string(self) -> io::Result<String>;\r\n    fn stream_to_vec(self) -> io::Result<Vec<u8>>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Read for DataStream { /* ... */ }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe might also consider abusing `unsafe` by adding an `open_unsafe()` method that sets no limit on the returned `DataStream` for cases we can't yet foresee.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to consider is that `limit` is not a sufficient...limit...to prevent DoS attacks. While it helps mitigates memory-exhaustion based attacks, it does nothing to prevent slow-loris style attacks. On `sync`, this means completely tying up resources, though there we have a read-timeout, which helps but doesn't solve the problem. On `async`, this translates to a bunch of idling futures, which in-turn means consuming memory, which takes us right back to memory-exhaustion.\r\n\r\nWhat we'd _really_ like to do is expose an API that requires limits to be set on several properties, with a hard, indelible limit provided by Rocket. In particular:\r\n  * read timeouts - how long we we're willing to wait between byte reads\r\n  * data limits - how many bytes we're willing to read in all, irrespective of time\r\n  * connection timeouts - how long we're willing to keep the connection open, irrespective of whether data is being received or not.\r\n\r\nMy take is that a bandwidth-minimum approach to the connection timeout might actually make a bit more sense, especially when we consider very purposefully long-lived connections. That is, after a chosen period of time, assuming the other timeouts/limits haven't been exceeded, require that the bandwidth over a sliding window of time exceeds some factor. Otherwise, kill the connection, ideally in a graceful manner.\r\n\r\nThis approach seems fairly easy to implement in `async`. Combined with the API I proposed above, this should significantly decrease the opportunity for DoS based attacks on Rocket applications, and in the common case, make them impossible.\r\n\r\n_This was largely ported over from https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/pull/990._","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1325/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
