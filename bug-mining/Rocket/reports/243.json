I'm not sure exactly what this lint is for, and what was should it be replaced with (if anything), but it would be nice to be able to avoid this warning on every struct that derives `FromForm`.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't be as big of an issue if people could do `#[allow(renamed_and_removed_lints)]`. But putting this before the derive macro doesn't actually cause the lint to be allowed, probably since the derive macro actually puts the line with that allow elsewhere. This makes it very annoying to use `FromForm` as the warning is unavoidable.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n - OS Distribution and Kernel: Arch Linux (6.4.12-arch1-1)\r\n - Rocket Version: 0.5.0-rc.3","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2608/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2608/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
