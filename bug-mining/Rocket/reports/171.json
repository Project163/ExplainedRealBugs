Top-level exports stay the same.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, the main `rocket` crate is usable on its own, though `rocket_contrib` is used quite widely. This is not my opinion, `rocket` has 300,963 downloads compared to `rocket_contrib`'s 222,619 at the time of creating this issue, around 74%. In the past 7 days, this averages to 575 per day for `rocket` and 470 per day for `rocket_contrib`, indicating that the current ratio is closer to 82%.\r\n\r\nWhile download numbers alone aren't a great indicator of how commonly the two are used together, I've honestly no idea on how to analyze such a thing on GitHub, for example. As such, my conclusion is that `rocket_contrib` is used in over 4 out of every 5 Rocket projects, and honestly probably should be used in all of them (for helmet if nothing else).\r\n\r\n### Proposed changes\r\n\r\nEliminate the `rocket_contrib` crate entirely, deprecating it on crates.io. All of the existing code and features would be moved into the current `core/lib` directory.\r\n\r\nI believe that all of the current top-level modules in `rocket_contrib` would be suitable to be top-level modules on `rocket` as well.\r\n\r\nThe current top-level modules are:\r\n\r\n- `json`\r\n- `serve`\r\n- `msgpack`\r\n- `templates`\r\n- `uuid`\r\n- `databases`\r\n- `helmet`\r\n\r\nThe modules would remain behind feature flags as they currently are, allowing users to opt-out of unnecessarily compilation if they're not using something. The defaults (`json` and `serve`) are sensible, though I'd personally include `helmet` as well.\r\n\r\n### What about the `rocket_contrib_codegen`?\r\n\r\nMerge it into `rocket_codgen`, eliminating the `rocket_contrib_codegen` crate. It wouldn't make much sense to have a codgen crate for a crate that doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n### `rocket_http`?\r\n\r\nThis could also be merged, though I haven't included it as part of this proposal because it's typically not a direct dependency. I'm not opposed to merging that as well, however.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
