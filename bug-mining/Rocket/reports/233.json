Please describe.**\r\nWhen you receive a TempFile, you can do almost nothing with it. Very often you do actually want to read the file you've received and sent it somewhere else, but the current API forces you to persist it to somewhere if you want to read it. \r\n\r\n**Why this feature can't or shouldn't live outside of Rocket**\r\nBecause TempFile is a type owned by rocket, you can't implement Stream on it without being rocket, and you also probably don't want to persist the file to then read it again, which you should do unless you want to rely on the #[doc(hidden)] elements of the enum. \r\n\r\n**Ideal Solution**\r\nImplement Stream on TempFile so people can read it and stream it places to their heart's content.\r\n\r\n**Alternatives Considered**\r\nYou could have an async method that returns a Vec<u8> of the file's contents, but this forces the contents of the entire file to go into memory.\r\nYou could also add another type like `Buffer` that just holds the entire file in memory.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\nThis helps #2148 and doesn't require another type for being a buffer, and doesn't buffer the entire file in memory.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
