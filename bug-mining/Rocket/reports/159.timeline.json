This was accomplished using lints, another kind of syntax extension. Unfortunately, the lint API is incredibly unstable, and lots of nightly-related breakage ensued as a result.\r\n\r\nThe idea was to bring back these lints in due time. In fact, the [guide](https://rocket.rs/guide/state/#unmanaged-state) still alludes to the lints for just this reason. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely given that the lint API will, with high probability, never stabilize. But one possibility is to introduce a new crate `rocket_lints`, that includes this very unstable code. See #389 for that idea.\r\n\r\nI'd be interested in how we can do this dynamically at launch time. While Rocket knows all of the managed state and mounted routes, it doesn't currently know about all of the request guards that could execute. One possibility is to generate some code for each route that informs Rocket about all of the request guards in some way. Then we can call this piece of code for each route at initialization, learn about all of the managed state types, and compare them against the set of types registered as managed states, and finally emit a warning.\r\n\r\nI would be open to mentoring an implementation of this!","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/346500948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1355023390,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEzNTUwMjMzOTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/1355023390","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-22T23:34:36Z","label":{"name":"help

PR would fix the issue #464 . I focused on not changing the public API, but it feels a little bit like a spaghetti code, since the types are forwarded from the `StaticRouteInfo`, to `Route`, and finally to the `Rocket` struct. \r\n\r\nOther issues with current solution:\r\n * requires just another nightly only feature\r\n * mapping from `TypeId` to human readable type name\r\n * reading the comments in `std` docs, I'm not sure it is encouraged to use `TypeId`\r\n * allows only 16 managed states per handler (is it really an issue?)\r\n\r\nThe mapping can be created during the codegen phase and stored alongside\r\nthe `TypeId`. Type names for unused managed states can be obtained using\r\n`std::any::type_name::<T>()`.\r\n\r\nI also included an expanded `main.rs` from the `state` example so that you can easily check the generated code. I'll, of course, remove it from the commit. Do you have any suggestions how to improve the approach of communicating the types from endpoint handlers to the `Rocket` struct?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4591617351,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQ1OTE2MTczNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/4591617351","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-14T06:16:24Z","milestone":{"title":"0.5.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4597111508,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ1OTcxMTE1MDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/4597111508","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eed6f47a5c4a2e9291cb8e611b5523b80acac8a6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/commits/eed6f47a5c4a2e9291cb8e611b5523b80acac8a6","created_at":"2021-04-15T05:18:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4603560143,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ2MDM1NjAxNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/4603560143","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"beb3454df00aca061ab9fd8c6966b9493eb96c1c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/commits/beb3454df00aca061ab9fd8c6966b9493eb96c1c","created_at":"2021-04-16T08:32:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4603621144,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ2MDM2MjExNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/4603621144","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gist
