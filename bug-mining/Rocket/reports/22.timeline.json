This is one of two remaining issues for 0.2!\r\n\r\nSo, looking at the [RFC, section 8.2.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1866), we should return a `400` when any of the following occurs:\r\n\r\n  1. A form string has no `=` at all or has no `=` after an `&`.\r\n  2. The form string contains spaces.\r\n  3. The form string contains unencoded URL characters.\r\n\r\nThe first one is pretty easy to detect but requires a change to the `FormItems` iterator. The second one means we have to check every string for spaces, which we can do efficiently if we change the `FormItems` decorator again. The last one...seems expensive, and I don't really know what the point of it is besides being able to send it in the URL.\r\n\r\nWould be good to know what other frameworks do here. My intuition is that we should just check for 1 and ignore 2 and 3. This can be done by simply adding a method to the `FormItems` structure to see if there is any remaining, unparsed text.

#3. (conference got in the way before I could finish it off, sorry for the delay)\r\n\r\nLoads bounce limits from config and then checks email addresses against those limits before sending the email. If any address violates a limit, the request will fail with status `429` and email will not be sent.\r\n\r\nAs it introduces a dependency on the fxa-auth-db-mysql repo, some extra scripting has been thrown in to make working with node.js easier.\r\n\r\nRunning `./tdb` will check whether an `fxa-auth-db-mysql` directory exists and, if not, clone the repo. Then it will check for running db server processes and, if none are found, run `npm i`, run the db patcher and start the db server in a background process. Then it finishes by invoking the existing `./t` script.\r\n\r\nThis is not ideal because it leaves the node process running in the background after tests have finished. But I figure it's good enough for now because it only leaves one of them running, they don't multiply with subsequent test runs. And you don't have to use the new script of course, if you already have the db server running in fxa-local-dev, you can just run `./t` and the tests should pass. The new script is mostly there for Travis' benefit.\r\n    \r\nLonger term, if this service is going to stick around, we can do something more permanent to manage it properly.\r\n\r\n@mozilla/fxa-devs r?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fxa-email-service/issues/22/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mozilla/fxa-email-service/issues/22/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13766680938,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzqMt84LxU3wzwAAAAM0juFq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/13766680938","actor":{"login":"Eijebong","id":3650385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTAzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3650385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong","html_url":"https://github.com/Eijebong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ed429cd487f050aa0474d074867682703767370e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Eijebong/Rocket/commits/ed429cd487f050aa0474d074867682703767370e","created_at":"2024-08-05T16:10:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
