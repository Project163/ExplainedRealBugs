day.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thanks for writing Rocket. It's a very powerful and easy to web framework.\r\nNow, I think I found a bug, although I'm not sure if this is supposed to happen.\r\n\r\n  1. Rocket version: Rocket Version: 0.2.8\r\n\r\n  2. Operating system: Windows 7 Service pack 1\r\n\r\n  3. A brief description of the bug that includes:\r\n    Having a page with two forms, by writing and posting the second form the response will be a bad parse, as Rocket expects to receive the fields from the first form and it receives the fields of the second. The behavior I expected would be for rocket to attempt to parse the first form, and failed that, attempt to parse the second.\r\n\r\n  4. How you uncovered the bug. Short, reproducible tests are especially useful.\r\n  https://gist.github.com/MrAsler/1429d3d470b0bda02847c4eea108a4e7\r\n  In this example, there are two forms, the first with two fields and the second with one. Attempting to post the second will result in said BadParse.\r\n\r\n  5.

One thing I wonder is whether leniency should be a property of the structure at all. Instead, leniency can be a property of a structure's _use_. Let me explain the difference.\r\n\r\nThe proposal thus far is that we can take a structure which we write today as:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm)]\r\nstruct Input {\r\n    a: String,\r\n    b: usize\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and add an attribute to make the derived `FromForm` implementation strict or lenient, like so:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm)]\r\n#[form(lenient)]\r\nstruct Input {\r\n    a: String,\r\n    b: usize\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the structure has been declared strict or lenient, it can never change. Any parsing of a form into that structure will be strict or lenient, whatever was declared.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach is to say that a structure can be parsed in a strict _or_ lenient fashion, and which is used depends on a runtime value. This would mean that the `FromForm` trait is changed to take an extra parameter that defines whether the parse should be strict or lenient:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub trait FromForm<'f>: Sized {\r\n    fn from_form(items: &mut FormItems<'f>, strict: bool) -> Result<Self, Self::Error>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this approach, no `#[form(lenient)]` attribute is needed. Instead, the decision is made at a _use_ site. In most cases, this will be as part of a route. To declare that a form should be parsed in a lenient fashion, we would use a new `LenientForm` type as the `data` target in a route, as follows:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[post(\"/stripe/endpoint\", data = \"<api_form>\")]\r\nfn endpoint(api_form: LenientForm<Input>) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will result in `Input` being parsed leniently. If instead `Form` had been used, parsing would be strict.\r\n\r\nI find that this _may_ be a better approach. First, it's backwards compatible (at the use site). Second, it enables features like #313 and #298 without having to ensure that structures are declared as lenient. Third, it means structures won't need a Rocket-specific annotation like `#[form(strict)]`. And fourth, it means that the same structure can be used in both a lenient and strict fashion in different routes and use-cases. The drawback, of course, is that it makes custom `FromForm` implementations a little harder. In practice, this should be a rare occurrence, and we should work to make it even rarer.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/307601528/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-11T02:55:16Z","updated_at":"2017-06-11T02:55:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/313","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/313/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/313/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/313/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/313","id":234660817,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzQ2NjA4MTc=","number":313,"title":"[Feature

Feature Requests\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. Why you believe this feature is necessary.\r\n\r\nGo, Rails, Express all have some way of parsing nested attributes easily from forms.\r\n\r\n  2. A convincing use-case for this feature.\r\n\r\nI think it would be pretty nice to have the ability to able to specify a struct like:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm]\r\nstruct StarterApplication {\r\n  user: User,\r\n  business: Business,\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[post(\"/apply\", data=\"<form>\")]\r\nfn post_apply(context: Context, form: StartedApplication) -> Flash<Redirect> {\r\n  //..\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd based on the dot notation or brackets, allow nested attributes in forms to parse automatically:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input type=\"email\" name=\"user[email]\" />\r\n<input type=\"email\" name=\"business[name]\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```html\r\n<input type=\"email\" name=\"user.email\" />\r\n<input type=\"email\" name=\"business.name\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead I find myself doing this:\r\n\r\n```Rust\r\n#[derive(FromForm, Serialize)]\r\nstruct StarterApplication {\r\n    user_email: String,\r\n    user_full_name: String,\r\n//... user fields ...\r\n    business_name: String,\r\n//... business fields ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand manually converting it to the individual structs.\r\n\r\nThat being said, if there was a way to possibly specify multiple structs on FromForm and get access to the form field name and not just the value, that might also be a viable option? I'm not sure what my options are regardless. Perhaps I'm missing something?\r\n\r\n  3. Why this feature can't or shouldn't exist outside of Rocket.\r\n\r\nIt could possibly be an extension of rocket if there was a way to get the values of the fields that come through. I'm not sure that is possible though.\r\n\r\nThanks!!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/313/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/313/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/307613584","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/242#issuecomment-307613584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/242","id":307613584,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzYxMzU4NA==","user":{"login":"stephanbuys","id":6009682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDk2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6009682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys","html_url":"https://github.com/stephanbuys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-11T08:12:04Z","updated_at":"2017-06-11T08:12:04Z","body":"I like the approach, especially in the light of #313 and #298.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/307613584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stephanbuys","id":6009682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDk2ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6009682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys","html_url":"https://github.com/stephanbuys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanbuys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/307663821","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/242#issuecomment-307663821","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/242","id":307663821,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNzY2MzgyMQ==","user":{"login":"drusellers","id":63355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drusellers","html_url":"https://github.com/drusellers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drusellers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drusellers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drusellers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drusellers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drusellers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drusellers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drusellers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drusellers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drusellers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-11T23:23:01Z","updated_at":"2017-06-11T23:23:01Z","body":"Love this new approach.
