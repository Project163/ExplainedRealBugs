Why you believe this feature is necessary.\r\n\r\n> The `client_ip` is pretty useful for logging or subnet filtering as long as the `X-Real-IP` is trusted, and it's very straight to user about mapping `IpAddr` to `client_ip`.\r\n\r\n> As we implemented, there are 2 addresses the server can get, `remote: SocketAddr` and `client_ip: IpAddr`, the former one already have a guard so I think provide another guard for the latter one looks good.\r\n\r\n  2. A convincing use-case for this feature.\r\n\r\n> Display user's IP at the footer of the page.\r\n\r\n  3. Why this feature can't or shouldn't exist outside of Rocket.\r\n\r\n> It's not possible to implement `FromRequest for IpAddr` outside of Rocket.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1414/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
