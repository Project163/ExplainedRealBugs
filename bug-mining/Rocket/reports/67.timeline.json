you share the relevant code in your project? Does it effectively look like this?\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn handler(..) -> Flash<T> { .. }\r\n\r\nimpl Fairing for MyFairing {\r\n    fn on_response(..) {\r\n        let flash = req.guard::<FlashMessage>()?;\r\n        // we never get here because `?` failed\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf so, then things are working as expected. Flash messages work through cookies. The `Flash` responder sets a cookie through a `Set-Cookie` header instead of the regular `request.cookies()` mechanism, so `FlashMessage` won't find the cookie until the next request. So while this isn't a bug, it's perhaps confusing behavior that we should amend.\r\n\r\nThere's no reason that `Flash` can't use the `request.cookies()` mechanism. If it did, it would immediately resolve your issue here. One positive nice side-effect of `Flash` not using `request.cookies()` is that it keeps the mechanism by which `Flash` works an implementation detail. The negative side-effect is that it doesn't use the regular cookies API.\r\n\r\nI'll think about this one.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/355801572/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/355811865","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/512#issuecomment-355811865","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/512","id":355811865,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NTgxMTg2NQ==","user":{"login":"TheNeikos","id":1631166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzExNjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1631166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos","html_url":"https://github.com/TheNeikos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeikos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-07T10:06:11Z","updated_at":"2018-01-07T10:10:40Z","body":"I have since simplified my code to have the specific piece of code in a `Responder`.
