This is something that I've seen supported in every web framework I've ever used. As an arbitrary example, [here's how it works in Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/quickstart/#static-files). This is a pretty common pattern to serve things like CSS files and JS scripts, so I think it would be useful to have. Obviously one can serve individual files by just having a handler that returns a `File`, but this seems like generally useful functionality. Ideally one would simply be able to do something like `rocket::ignite().mount(\"/static\", StaticFiles(some_path)`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/239/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
