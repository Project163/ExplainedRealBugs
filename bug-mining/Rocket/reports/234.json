However, cookies are not marked as secure by default.\r\n\r\nThe functionality to mark a cookie as secure is there, but when libraries set cookies for you it is nearly impossible to mark it as secure. For example https://github.com/jebrosen/rocket_oauth2/blob/0.5.0-rc.1/src/lib.rs#L693 is not marked as secure and cannot be done in any trivial way.\r\n\r\n**Suggested Changes**\r\n\r\nMark private cookies as secure by default. I.e. add 3 lines of code to: https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/blob/v0.5.0-rc.2/core/lib/src/cookies.rs#L497\r\n\r\n**Alternatives Considered**\r\n\r\nThis could probably be done using some proxy like nginx, but it would be very hacky. When not using a proxy it is hard to do when using existing libraries like Rocket OAUTH2.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\n\r\nOptions to consider:\r\n- only do so when a secure connection is used\r\n- only make it the default for production builds","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
