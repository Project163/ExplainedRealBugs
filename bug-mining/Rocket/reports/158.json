Environment\r\n- OS: Archlinux 5.2.9\r\n- Rocket: 0.4\r\n- cargo / rustc: 1.39.0-nightly\r\n\r\n# What ?\r\nThe testing API of rocket doesn't allow to test Fairings having an `on_launch` callback.\r\n\r\n## To reproduce\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene)]\r\n\r\n#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;\r\n\r\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};\r\n\r\nuse rocket::{\r\n    Data,\r\n    fairing::{\r\n        Fairing,\r\n        Kind,\r\n        Info\r\n    },\r\n    Request,\r\n    Rocket\r\n};\r\n\r\nstruct TestFairing {\r\n    initialized: AtomicBool\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl TestFairing {\r\n    pub fn new() -> Self {\r\n        Self {\r\n            initialized: AtomicBool::new(false)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Fairing for TestFairing\r\n{\r\n    fn info(&self) -> Info\r\n    {\r\n        Info {\r\n            name: \"TestFairing for on_launch callback\",\r\n            kind: Kind::Launch | Kind::Request\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn on_launch(&self, _rocket: &Rocket)\r\n    {\r\n        self.initialized.store(true, Ordering::Relaxed);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn on_request(&self, _request: &mut Request<'_>, _data: &Data)\r\n    {\r\n        if self.initialized.load(Ordering::Relaxed) == false {\r\n            panic!(\"This should have been set to true in `Fairing::on_launch`\");\r\n        }\r\n    } \r\n}\r\n\r\n#[get(\"/<name>/<age>\")]\r\nfn hello(name: String, age: u8) -> String {\r\n    format!(\"Hello, {} year old named {}!\", age, name)\r\n}\r\n\r\nmod on_launch_fairing {\r\n    use super::*;\r\n    use rocket::local::Client;\r\n\r\n    #[test]\r\n    fn test_on_launch() {\r\n        let rocket = rocket::ignite()\r\n            .attach(TestFairing::new())\r\n            .mount(\"/hello\", routes![hello]);\r\n        let client = Client::new(rocket).expect(\"valid rocket instance\");\r\n\r\n        let req = client.get(\"/hello/John%20Doe/37\");\r\n        let mut response = req.dispatch();\r\n        let _body = response.body_string();\r\n\r\n        // At this point, if the test succeed, no panic happened\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Why ?\r\n\r\nAs you can see below, in `Rocket::launch`, `self.fairings.handle_launch(&self);` will trigger the `on_launch` callback of the attached fairings.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn launch(mut self) -> LaunchError {\r\n        self = match self.prelaunch_check() {\r\n            Ok(rocket) => rocket,\r\n            Err(launch_error) => return launch_error\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        /// ...\r\n\r\n            // Freeze managed state for synchronization-free accesses later.\r\n            self.state.freeze();\r\n\r\n            // Run the launch fairings.\r\n            self.fairings.handle_launch(&self);\r\n\r\n        /// ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in `rocket::local::Client` which is used for testing, only `Rocket::prelaunch_check()` is used. (`new(...)` calls `_new(...)`)\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn _new(rocket: Rocket, tracked: bool) -> Result<Client, LaunchError> {\r\n    let cookies = match tracked {\r\n        true => Some(RwLock::new(CookieJar::new())),\r\n        false => None\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    Ok(Client { rocket: rocket.prelaunch_check()?, cookies })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to include a call to `Rocket.fairings.handle_launch()` in a Client start by maybe providing a test-only launch method usable by the Client.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.\r\n\r\nCugeDe","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1154/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
