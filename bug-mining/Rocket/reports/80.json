My initial thoughts on a design for this can be summarized as:\r\n\r\n  * All configuration, including the pool size, which database to use, credentials, etc, should be done in the `Rocket.toml` file. It would be nice if configuration issues were reported at Rocket initialization, ~~but this likely requires a more involved change to Rocket~~.\r\n  * Dependencies should be included on an as-needed basis. For instance, `contrib` shouldn't pull in `postgres` if the user only wants `sqlite`.\r\n  * A single type should be exposed per configured database. The type should implement `FromRequest`, which results in a connection being taken from the connection pool.\r\n  * Multiple databases, including several of the same type, should be allowed in a single project.\r\n  * All major databases with Rust adapters should be supported, this includes:\r\n    - postgres\r\n    - redis\r\n    - mysql\r\n    - sqlite\r\n    - cypher/neo4j\r\n    - couchdb\r\n    - diesel (postgres, sqlite)\r\n\r\nThe list of \"major databases\" is just that from the [r2d2](https://github.com/sfackler/r2d2) adapters page. The `r2d2` library should likely be used as the backing connection pool. ~~The [state](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/state) crate should likely be used to make the connection pool accessible globally to the `contrib` database module.~~\r\n\r\nEdit: To clarify, it should be possible, and indeed a requirement of a good implementation, to use multiple databases in a single project, and even multiple different connections to a single type of database. For instance, I should be able to get handles to two different MySQL databases, a Redis store, and a PostgreSQL database without issue.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/167/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
