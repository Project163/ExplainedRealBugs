I was trying to get a `#[get(\"/<path..>\")]` route to work for that, and the only reason it didn't work is because I also had another, high-priority catch-all `NamedFile` route. Finally, I found out through [this issue](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/1148) that I could just write `#[catch(404)]` and where that is documented.\r\n\r\nI had previously looked at all the routing docs I found because that's where I expected this to be documented. I think it would be very useful to link to the error catchers docs from the routing overview, and maybe also the more detailed routing page, to avoid this happening to other people too. Or maybe the error catching section could be moved up to immediately after the routing section, that would also make it much easier to discover.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
