Just use `TempFile` as a field of a struct that implements `FromForm`.\r\n\r\nThe spec is a bit peculiar in my opinion as there is no way to know in advance all the fields that will be provided aside of the `operations` and `map` field. \r\n\r\nThe submitted form could be : \r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n operations : <Json Object>,\r\n map: <Json Object>,\r\n 0: binary,\r\n 1: binary\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nas

with the `fromForm`, which is why i wrote the previously mentioned prototype, as it processes all the boundaries provided acknowledging that we cant know how many there'll be in advance and what there key name will be. \r\n\r\nBut maybe i'm missing some subtleties with rust structs that would make it feasible or compatible with fromForm ? 🤷 If so, i haven't found yet

your feature request motivated by a concrete problem? Please describe.**\r\nWhen you receive a TempFile, you can do almost nothing with it. Very often you do actually want to read the file you've received and sent it somewhere else, but the current API forces you to persist it to somewhere if you want to read it. \r\n\r\n**Why this feature can't or shouldn't live outside of Rocket**\r\nBecause TempFile is a type owned by rocket, you can't implement Stream on it without being rocket, and you also probably don't want to persist the file to then read it again, which you should do unless you want to rely on the #[doc(hidden)] elements of the enum. \r\n\r\n**Ideal Solution**\r\nImplement Stream on TempFile so people can read it and stream it places to their heart's content.\r\n\r\n**Alternatives Considered**\r\nYou could have an async method that returns a Vec<u8> of the file's contents, but this forces the contents of the entire file to go into memory.\r\nYou could also add another type like `Buffer` that just holds the entire file in memory.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\nThis helps #2148 and doesn't require another type for being a buffer, and doesn't buffer the entire file in memory.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/1240398480","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2148#issuecomment-1240398480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2148","id":1240398480,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzqMt85J7vqQ","user":{"login":"eric8607242","id":17409001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDA5MDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17409001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric8607242","html_url":"https://github.com/eric8607242","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric8607242/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric8607242/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric8607242/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric8607242/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric8607242/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric8607242/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric8607242/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric8607242/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric8607242/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-08T08:30:14Z","updated_at":"2022-09-08T08:30:46Z","body":"Hello!
