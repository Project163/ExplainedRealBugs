What's missing?\n\nI would like to load custom extensions to an SQLite database (such as [fuzzy](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/blob/main/docs/fuzzy.md) or [vsv](https://github.com/nalgeon/sqlean/blob/main/docs/vsv.md)).\r\n\r\nSQLx currently supports it, but I could not find a way to achieve that in the framework\n\n### Ideal Solution\n\nIn the `init` function as follow:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Database)]\r\n#[database(\"ship\")]\r\npub struct Database(SqlitePool);\r\n\r\n#[rocket::launch]\r\nfn rocket() -> _ {\r\n  rocket::build().attach(Database::init(&[\"trusted/sqlite/extension\"]));\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Why can't this be implemented outside of Rocket?\n\nSQLx initialization, pool and connection is managed by Rocket itself, for which we do not have a way to configure the behavior.\n\n### Are there workarounds usable today?\n\nI am looking for one.\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### System Checks\n\n- [X] I do not believe that this feature can or should be implemented outside of Rocket.\n- [X] I was unable to find a previous request for this feature.","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/2762/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
