trying to create a data guard which returns a JSON response if it fails to parse the received data.\r\n\r\nI tried the approach described in #772 but I had the following error\r\n\r\n```\r\nthe trait `rocket::data::FromData<'_>` is not implemented for `std::result::Result<rocket_contrib::json::Json<std::vec::Vec<Person>>, ServerError>`\r\n```\r\n\r\nKnowing that I implemented `Responder` for my custom error struct `ServerError` and the handler looks like this\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[post(\"/person\", data = \"<persons>\")]\r\nfn post_persons<'a>(\r\n    persons: Result<Json<Vec<Person>>, ServerError>\r\n) -> Result<JsonValue, ServerError> {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDid I missed something?\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/929/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13766682118,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzqMt84VaWfkzwAAAAM0juYG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/13766682118","actor":{"login":"Eijebong","id":3650385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTAzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3650385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong","html_url":"https://github.com/Eijebong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Eijebong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"74007815a00654748af113641df68977281b9d36","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Eijebong/Rocket/commits/74007815a00654748af113641df68977281b9d36","created_at":"2024-08-05T16:10:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
