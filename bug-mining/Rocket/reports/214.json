Why you believe this feature is necessary.\r\n        In order to get a raw string from a template, a user must use the non-recommended `show` API which requires access to the underlying rocket instance. As far as I'm aware, it's not possible for any route to get access to the Rocket instance since FromRequest is rightfully not implemented for Rocket. \r\n\r\n  2. A convincing use-case for this feature.\r\n    I'd like to be able to use the same Tera templating engine that is attached to the main Rocket application to send templated emails. Currently I'd have to set up another engine that's completely separate but has the same(ish) configuration via lazy_static or a custom guard.\r\n\r\n## General Comments\r\nI'm sure that this would require a lot of work after glancing at the API, but in the *general* case I'd like to be able to call `finalize` directly on the template and pass the context in. I'm also positive that it'll make for a somewhat confusing API since there are functions that you *can* call but shouldn't in the general case. I'd love to hear more discussion on this.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1177/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1177/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
