Cookie paths weren't clear to me so I tried to set a cookie in \"/cookies/set\" and print it in \"/cookies/get\". This doesn't work because the path set by Cookies::new() in this case is \"/cookies/set\", so the cookie isn't accessible from \"/cookies/get\".\r\n> Adding a hint or warning that the path you try to read the cookie from must start with the same path you set it from might be helpful for newcomers.\r\n\r\nThat should not be the case - if you don't set a specific `Path` on the cookie, then any path should be able to read the cookie (as long as the other restrictions on the cookie are met). Do you have a minimal example of this we could test?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Results in \"SyntaxError: JSON.parse: expected property name or '}' at line 1 column 3 of the JSON data\" in Firefox.\r\n\r\nYes, that is a mistake in the guide. We would be happy to accept a PR fixing it, or I should be able to do it this weekend.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> \"Responders may fail; they need not always generate a response.\"\r\n> Is this correct? English isn't my first language. To me it seems like there something missing.\r\n> \"Responders may fail; they don't always need to generate a response.\"\r\n> This seems correct to me, but I'm not sure if some meaning is lost.\r\n\r\nThese two sentences actually have the same meaning in English! What do you think about this rewording, though:\r\n\r\n\"Responders may fail instead of generating a response, by returning `Err` with a status code. When this happens, Rocket forwards the request to the error catcher for the given status code.\"\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Shouldn't an error description be used with `expect`?\r\n\r\nI have always thought this was a style choice (if anyone knows of any specific guidelines, I would love to see them!) But the current messages actually would end up looking awkward if they were printed, something like `thread 'main' panicked at 'valid rocket instance: LaunchError { ... }`\r\n\r\nSo, perhaps we should change them. I think this one is lower priority to fix than the other issues listed, because at least for `expect` the filename and line number are still part of the message/stack trace.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/comments/650276112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3487324373,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM0ODczMjQzNzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/3487324373","actor":{"login":"jebrosen","id":7102588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI1ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7102588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen","html_url":"https://github.com/jebrosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jebrosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-06-26T16:36:59Z","label":{"name":"docs","color":"d4c5f9"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"arctic-alpaca","id":67190338,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTkwMzM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67190338?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arctic-alpaca","html_url":"https://github.com/arctic-alpaca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arctic-alpaca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arctic-alpaca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arctic-alpaca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arctic-alpaca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arctic-alpaca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arctic-alpaca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arctic-alpaca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arctic-alpaca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arctic-alpaca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-27T07:19:31Z","updated_at":"2020-06-27T07:19:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1359","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1359/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1359/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1359/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rwf2/Rocket/pull/1359","id":646628606,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDQwODc1MjU2","number":1359,"title":"Guide
