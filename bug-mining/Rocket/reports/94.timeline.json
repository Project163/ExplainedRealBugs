At least these functions in the same file probably need similar modifications: `data_expr` (`__req`, `__data`), `query_exprs` (`__trail`, `__data`). Additionally, tests like @Korvox's should be added to guarantee that all kinds of guards work from macros in this way. Any other macros such as `#[catch]` should probably be checked, too.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/core/codegen/src/attribute/route.rs b/core/codegen/src/attribute/route.rs\r\nindex 73bf86e..74213c7
