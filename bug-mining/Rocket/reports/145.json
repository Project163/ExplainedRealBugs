(Rust group @sslab-gatech) found a memory-safety/soundness issue in this crate while scanning Rust code on crates.io for potential vulnerabilities.\n\n## Issue Description\n\nhttps://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/blob/c24f15c18f02319be83af4f3c1951dc220b52c5e/core/http/src/uri/formatter.rs#L334-L357\n\n`with_prefix()` method converts `&str` to `&'static str` with the justification above.\nUnfortunately, the prefix is not popped if line 353 panics.\nIn such case, the transmuted `&'static str` persists in `prefixes` field and will lead to use-after-free if the formatter is accessed again.\n\n## Reproduction\n\nBelow is an example program that demonstrates use-after-free using safe APIs of `rocket_http`.\n\n<details><summary>Show Detail</summary>\n<p>\n\nThe program is expected to write `hello=world`.\nHowever, due to the aforementioned use-after-free, it prints `12345=world` instead.\n\n```rust\n#![forbid(unsafe_code)]\n\nuse rocket_http::uri::{Formatter, Query, UriDisplay};\n\nstruct MyDisplay;\n\nstruct MyValue;\n\nimpl UriDisplay<Query> for MyValue {\n    fn fmt(&self, _f: &mut Formatter<Query>) -> std::fmt::Result {\n        panic!()\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Wrapper<'a, 'b>(&'a mut Formatter<'b, Query>);\n\nimpl UriDisplay<Query> for MyDisplay {\n    fn fmt(&self, formatter: &mut Formatter<Query>) -> std::fmt::Result {\n        let wrapper = Wrapper(formatter);\n        let temporary_string = String::from(\"hello\");\n        wrapper.0.write_named_value(&temporary_string, MyValue)\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<'a, 'b> Drop for Wrapper<'a, 'b> {\n    fn drop(&mut self) {\n        let _overlap = String::from(\"12345\");\n        self.0.write_raw(\"world\").ok();\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"{}\", &MyDisplay as &dyn UriDisplay<Query>);\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nthread 'main' panicked at 'explicit panic', src/main.rs:28:9\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\n12345=world\nReturn code 101\n```\n\n### Tested Environment\n\n* Crate: rocket_http\n* Version: 0.4.6\n* OS: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS\n* Rustc version: rustc 1.51.0-nightly (04caa632d 2021-01-30)\n\n</p>\n</details>","closed_by":{"login":"SergioBenitez","id":1480321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1480321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez","html_url":"https://github.com/SergioBenitez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SergioBenitez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
