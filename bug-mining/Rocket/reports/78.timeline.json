In a request guard you can't access the request body. You *must* do something with the data but also *can't* do anything with the data.\r\n\r\nThe way it works currently it would seem that any guards that may be used with file uploads just can't return Outcome::Failure. This seems like a major ergonomics issue.\r\n\r\nEven with access to the request body in many cases this behavior isn't really workable. Receiving a potentially multi-GB file upload before sending back an error is an issue as you've stated but the alternative of leaving the client to blindly guess about if the server/db is down, the file is too large, the file already exists, the client's credentials don't have the needed permissions (which could vary by folder or other things), some upload quota has been reached (and when to try again), the request was malformed (e.g. multipart data), or any number of other issues isn't really a solution.\r\n\r\nYou've said you can't avoid reading the data without closing the connection but the issue isn't that the connection is being closed; it's that it's being closed *before* sending the response.\r\n\r\nThis is the most relevant part of the spec i could find (which seems to allow this behavior).\r\nSee the last bullet point for origin servers. Note that while it says \"SHOULD NOT\" that is comparing it to reading the full body and returning a response, not closing the connection without sending a response. The cited concern that the client may not receive the response is obviously a larger concern when the response is not sent at all.\r\nhttps://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec8.html#sec8.2.3\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/blob/v0.3/lib/src/data/data_stream.rs#L43\r\nChanging `Shutdown::Both` to
