Routes that do not `await` anything can remain unchanged. `#[catch]`ers can also be defined as an `async fn`.\r\n  * Methods on `Data` now return `Future`s that must be `.await`ed. As a consequence, any route that uses `Data` directly must be `async`. Routes that use data guards such as `Json` are not affected by this change.\r\n  * Routes that make their own network requests or other I/O should be `async`, as it will allow other requests to continue while waiting for the operation.\r\n* Mid and low-level APIs (`FromTransformedData` and `FromData`, `Fairing`, `Responder`)\r\n  * Several traits are now defined using `async-trait`, re-exported as `#[rocket::async_trait]`.\r\n  * Data is read asynchronously: `DataStream` implements `tokio::io::AsyncRead` instead of `Read`. Thus, `FromTransformedData::transform` and `From(Transformed)Data::from_data` are `async fn` or return `Future`s.\r\n  * Response bodies are streamed to the client asynchronously: `set_body` and related methods expect `tokio::io::AsyncRead` instead of `Read`.\r\n    * Consequently, `Fairing::on_response` and `Responder::respond_to` are now `async fn`. This allows Responders and Fairings to access and/or replace the body data.\r\n* The testing APIs have been moved to `rocket::local::asynchronous` and `rocket::local::blocking`. The `blocking` test API is simpler to use, and recommended when possible.\r\n* `#[rocket::main]`, `#[rocket::launch]`, and `#[rocket::async_test]` have been added to make `async fn` easily accessible for `main()` and `test()`.\r\n* Many long-standing bugs with keep-alive, graceful shutdown (#180), performance, and more are fixed or will be easier to fix by using actively-supported versions of libraries.\r\n* Some new functionality will be possible to implement, such as SSE and WebSockets. These will likely not make it into Rocket 0.5. At this point, Rocket should not be missing any APIs necessary to implement SSE \"by hand\". WebSockets is a bit more complicated, and tracked in #90

Rocket (`> 0.4`) is not particularly susceptible to the kinds of attacks described below. This issue tracks being able to do _better than the status quo_, not merely meeting it. There are no known bugs or deficiencies, security or otherwise, related to the topics described in this issue.**\r\n\r\nA data `limit` (#1325) is not a sufficient...limit...to prevent DoS attacks. While it helps mitigates memory-exhaustion based attacks, it does nothing to prevent slow-loris style attacks. On `async`, this translates to a bunch of idling futures, which in-turn means consuming memory, which takes us to memory-exhaustion.\r\n\r\nWhat we'd _really_ like to do is expose an API that requires limits to be set on several properties, with a hard, indelible limit provided by Rocket. In particular:\r\n  * read timeouts - how long we we're willing to wait between byte reads\r\n  * data limits - how many bytes we're willing to read in all, irrespective of time\r\n  * connection timeouts - how long we're willing to keep the connection open, irrespective of whether data is being received or not.\r\n\r\nMy take is that an adaptive bandwidth-minimum approach to the connection timeout might actually make a bit more sense, especially when we consider very purposefully long-lived connections. That is, after a chosen period of time, assuming the other timeouts/limits haven't been exceeded, require that the bandwidth over a sliding window of time exceeds some value. Otherwise, kill the connection, ideally in a graceful manner.\r\n\r\nThis approach seems fairly easy to implement in `async`. Combined with the API I proposed above, this should significantly decrease the opportunity for DoS based attacks on Rocket applications, and in the common case, make them impossible.\r\n\r\n_This was largely ported over from #990 and #1325._","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1405/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/1405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11603835665,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzqMt84ln_qLzwAAAAKzpHsR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rwf2/Rocket/issues/events/11603835665","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"549c9241c41320fc5af76b53c2ffc3bd8db88f8c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Necmttn/Rocket/commits/549c9241c41320fc5af76b53c2ffc3bd8db88f8c","created_at":"2024-01-26T01:02:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
