8259, 6 Numbers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-6) allows numbers of arbitrary range and precision specifying that a particular implementation may set some limits for numeric values. As of Gson 2.8.4 uses the following deserialization strategies:\r\n\r\n* If the result type is declared as `Object`, Gson always returns `Double`s for all encountered JSON numbers. In this case, the minimum and maximum hold number value fits the limits of `Double` which cannot hold exact `Long` values that exceed the `Double` exact precision limits (`2^53+1`).\r\n* ‎If the result type is declared as `Number` and there are no custom `Number` adapters, Gson always returns `LazilyParsedNumber`s that hold original string values parsing them to a requested type lazily allowing to use the whole range of `Long`. However, it does not allow to use numbers of arbitrary range and precision, and does not expose its hold string as a `BigDecimal`.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix these limitations and preserve backwards compatibility, some sort of \"to-number\" strategies might be accepted in `GsonBuilder` to override the default behavior of Gson. This pull-request introduces such a strategy interface to be used in the built-in `Object` and `Number` type adapters. There are also four strategies implemented in this PR (two standard to keep the backwards compatibility and two enhanced to overcome the limitations) using an enumeration:\r\n\r\n* `ToNumberPolicy.DOUBLE` that implements the default behavior of the `Object` type adapter returning `Double`s only.\r\n*  `ToNumberPolicy.LAZILY_PARSED_NUMBER` that implements the default behavior of the `Number` type adapter.\r\n* `ToNumberPolicy.LONG_OR_DOUBLE` that tries to parse a number as a `Long`, otherwise then tries to parse it as a `Double`, if the number cannot be parsed as a `Long`.\r\n* `ToNumberPolicy.BIG_DECIMAL` that can parse numbers of arbitrary range and precision.\r\n\r\nCall-site is expected to extract proper values using the methods declared in `java.lang.Number`.\r\n\r\nExamples of use:\r\n\r\n#### Default behavior, backwards-compatible with the previous versions of Gson\r\n\r\n```java\r\nGson gson = new GsonBuilder()\r\n  .setObjectToNumberStrategy(ToNumberPolicy.DOUBLE) // explicit default, may be omitted\r\n  .create();\r\nList<Object> actual = gson.fromJson(\"[null, 10, 10.0]\", new TypeToken<List<Object>>() {}.getType());\r\nList<Double> expected = Arrays.asList(null, 10.0, 10.0);\r\nassertEquals(expected, actual);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\nGson gson = new GsonBuilder()\r\n

#1661 this library moved from the old Jackson-based JSON parser to a Gson-based JSON parser. This change seems to be causing some regressions in the downstream codebases like Firebase.\r\n\r\n### 1.  JSON-parser leniency\r\n\r\nGson is a lot more lenient in the inputs it accept as valid JSON. As a result the following test case would pass in the older versions of the API client, but fails in more recent versions.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void testLenience() {\r\n    JsonParser parser = Utils.getDefaultJsonFactory().createJsonParser(\"not json\");\r\n    Map<String, Object> destination = new HashMap<>();\r\n    try {\r\n      parser.parseAndClose(destination);\r\n      fail(\"No error thrown\");\r\n    } catch (IOException ex) {\r\n      // expected\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems when using the Gson API directly, there's a way to set parser to a \"strict\" mode by turning off leniency, but this option is not exposed when parsing using the Google API client.\r\n\r\n### 2. Malformed JSON exceptions\r\n\r\nThis is more of a consequence of the above issue. Trying to parse certain malformed JSON strings into objects used to result in an `IOException`. But now it can result in other runtime exceptions like `IllegalArgumentException`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Test\r\npublic void testExceptionType()\r\n    JsonParser parser = Utils.getDefaultJsonFactory().createJsonParser(\"not json\");\r\n    try {\r\n      parser.parseAndClose(Foo.class); \r\n    } catch (IOException e) {\r\n      e.printStackTrace();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static class Foo {\r\n  @Key(\"name\")\r\n  private String name;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Broken float serialization\r\n\r\nThis seems to be due https://github.com/google/gson/issues/1127. Serializing floating point values is not working correctly.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.out.println(Utils.getDefaultJsonFactory().toString(0.2f));\r\n// Output: 0.20000000298023224\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that there is again a workaround when using Gson directly. But that's not possible when using the Google API client.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/googleapis/google-api-java-client/issues/1779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/googleapis/google-api-java-client/issues/1779/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"escardin","id":12631891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjMxODkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12631891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/escardin","html_url":"https://github.com/escardin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/escardin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/escardin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/escardin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/escardin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/escardin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/escardin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/escardin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/escardin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/escardin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-07T14:25:37Z","updated_at":"2021-07-07T14:25:37Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cashapp/misk/issues/2029","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cashapp/misk","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cashapp/misk/issues/2029/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cashapp/misk/issues/2029/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cashapp/misk/issues/2029/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cashapp/misk/pull/2029","id":938028377,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njg0NDg2MjMx","number":2029,"title":"Add
