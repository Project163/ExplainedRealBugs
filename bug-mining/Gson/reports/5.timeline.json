are currently suffering from the following projects:\n\n+ (Superseded) Eclipse lsp4j, which is itself a shit mountain (doesn't work with jpms, caused a lot of installation/jlink problems, written in Java 8) and also has shit mountain dependencies (guava, xtext, xtend, etc.)\n  + I found an alternative, see https://github.com/georgewfraser/java-language-server/issues/197\n  + Published! ![](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.aya-prover.upstream/javacs-protocol)\n+ The badass jlink plugin of Gradle -- it is not itself a shit mountain (it's a great project), but it's designed _for_ shit mountains. It aims at repackaging your fatJar into a jpms module and let jlink process it. Aya is built entirely with jpms, so if we have all upstream deps jpms-ed, we can get rid of this plugin entirely.\n  + ~~The plugin does not work with Java 19.~~\n    + There are new maintainers now, works with latest Java\n+ Gradle -- it is fine at the moment because we still want it to offer us the ability to publish to maven central, but Gradle is also designed for maven style projects. Ughh.\n+ (Superseded) ANTLR4-runtime -- doesn't support jpms is the only problem (yet). Seems not very hard to repackage with jpms support.\n  + We've decided #466 \n+ (Superseded) Commonmark -- ~~doesn't support jpms, written in Java 8 with a return-void visitor (https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java/issues/125). I think we can take some code from it, repackage, and add jpms support.~~\n  + ~~There is an outdated attempt to add jpms: https://github.com/xzel23/commonmark-java/tree/0.14.0-jigsaw~~\n  + ~~Already repackaged and redistrubuted, see https://github.com/aya-prover/commonmark-java~~ outdated\n  + The official distribution how supports jpms\n  + Now we're using repackaged JetBrains/markdown, which is even better for our own purposes\n+ (Acceptable) GSON -- it's a PROJECT FROM GOOGLE so it's gonna be a disaster to depend on it. However, it supports jpms, so I think it's fine to use it (well but people are complaining https://github.com/google/gson/issues/1315#issuecomment-733899200).\n+ (Removed) ~~JImGui -- it doesn't yet have jpms support, but I can add it in a minute since it's _my_ project, so it's a small problem.~~\n\nAlso, I propose removing the tgbot subproject since it's useless.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aya-prover/aya-dev/issues/35/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aya-prover/aya-dev/issues/35/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12598045602,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAfCA984TKtpPzwAAAALu5uui","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/events/12598045602","actor":{"login":"samyakb","id":16825207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODI1MjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16825207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samyakb","html_url":"https://github.com/samyakb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samyakb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samyakb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samyakb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samyakb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samyakb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samyakb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samyakb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samyakb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samyakb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5bbc768fa6cd3e8a3a7bebf52b0ac1e4c6e0bd12","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/samyakb/gson/commits/5bbc768fa6cd3e8a3a7bebf52b0ac1e4c6e0bd12","created_at":"2024-04-24T21:04:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
