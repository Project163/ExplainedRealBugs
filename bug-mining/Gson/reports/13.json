guys!\n\nI was thinking of the problem and have concluded, that the solution of the\nissue (see link\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/google-gson/t/677d56e9976d7761):\nJsonObjectDeserializationVisitor should check if there is custom\ndeserializer registered for specified type and not create instance by.\n\n  Something like this:\n\n  @SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n  JsonObjectDeserializationVisitor(JsonElement json, Type type,\n      ObjectNavigatorFactory factory, ObjectConstructor objectConstructor,\n      TypeAdapter typeAdapter,\nParameterizedTypeHandlerMap<JsonDeserializer<?>> deserializers,\n      JsonDeserializationContext context) {\n    super(json, factory, objectConstructor, typeAdapter, deserializers,\ncontext);\n    JsonDeserializer deserialezer;\n    if ((deserialezer = deserializers.getHandlerFor(type)) != null) {\n      this.target = deserialezer.deserialize(json, type, context);\n    } else {\n      this.target = (T) objectConstructor.construct(type);\n    }\n  }\n\n\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `tazija@gmail.com` on 27 Aug 2008 at
