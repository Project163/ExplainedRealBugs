noted in the documentation for [`JsonReader.setLenient`](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.google.code.gson/gson/latest/com.google.gson/com/google/gson/stream/JsonReader.html#setLenient(boolean)), there are a number of areas where Gson accepts JSON inputs that are not strictly conformant, even when lenient mode is off:\r\n\r\n> * JsonReader allows the literals `true`, `false` and `null` to have any capitalization, for example `fAlSe`\r\n> * JsonReader supports the escape sequence `\\'`, representing a `'`\r\n> * JsonReader supports the escape sequence `\\LF` (with `LF` being the Unicode character U+000A), resulting in a LF within the read JSON string\r\n> * JsonReader allows unescaped control characters (U+0000 through U+001F)\r\n\r\nTo which we could add that it allows a trailing comma in JSON arrays, for example `[\"foo\", \"bar\",]` as noted in #494.\r\n\r\nWe could imagine that `GsonBuilder` would acquire a method `setStrict()`, mutually exclusive with `setLenient()` and that `JsonReader` would likewise acquire `setStrict(boolean)` and `isStrict()`. We can't make strict mode the default, for fear of breaking existing users, but we could recommend it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/2295/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/2295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/comments/1455142427","html_url":"https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2334#issuecomment-1455142427","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/2334","id":1455142427,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfCA985Wu7Yb","user":{"login":"eamonnmcmanus","id":5246810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDY4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5246810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus","html_url":"https://github.com/eamonnmcmanus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-05T16:44:45Z","updated_at":"2023-03-05T16:44:45Z","body":"I agree.
