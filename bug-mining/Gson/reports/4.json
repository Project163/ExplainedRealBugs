This is due to the fact that the `visitedTypeVariables` map receives an entry for `T`, resolves it properly, and then upon subsequent attempt to resolve `T` fails, since the `visitedTypeVariables` set indicates that `T` has already been resolved.","closed_by":{"login":"eamonnmcmanus","id":5246810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDY4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5246810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus","html_url":"https://github.com/eamonnmcmanus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/1390/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/1390/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
