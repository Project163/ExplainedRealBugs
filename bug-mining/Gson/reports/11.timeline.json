posted by @eamonnmcmanus in https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2231#issuecomment-1319325202**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHi, just back from vacation. :-)\r\n\r\nMy initial reactions:\r\n\r\n1. Rather than `GsonBuilder.setNewlineStyle` which is only relevant if `GsonBuilder.setPrettyPrinting()` has been called, I think it might be better to overload `GsonBuilder.setPrettyPrinting` with a version that takes a parameter describing the pretty-printing style. We could imagine that this might later include things like indentation (currently [hardcoded](https://github.com/google/gson/blob/3f1e62d1e1b43f1d76af5106f9484e940bf74606/gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/Gson.java#L887) to two spaces).\r\n2. I'm not really convinced that the `NewlineStyle` class is justified. If we had a `FormattingStyle` class then we might imagine it looking like this initially:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class FormattingStyle {\r\n  private final String newline;\r\n\r\n  private FormattingStyle(String newline) {\r\n    this.newline = newline;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  public static final FormattingStyle DEFAULT = new FormattingStyle(\"\\n\");\r\n\r\n  public FormattingStyle withNewline(String newline) {\r\n    return new FormattingStyle(newline);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich would evolve in the expected way if we add other parameters like indent. I don't think it is really necessary to have constants for the kinds of newline style. We can certainly document the two prevailing styles, and perhaps require that the `newline` string match `[\\r\\n]+`. If people need a `CRLF` constant they can trivially define one themselves.\r\n\r\nI'll also note, playing Devil's Advocate a bit, that it's pretty easy to do `gson.toJson(...).replace(\"\\n\", \"\\r\\n\")`.\r\n\r\n

`gson.toJson(...).replace(\"\\n\", \"\\r\\n\")`.\r\n\r\nThat's true, and it is something I did for years (and it annoyed me for years :-).\r\nIt feels \"unclean\" and it renders all the `toJson` methods that take a `JsonWriter` useless, and probably doubles the memory consumption (probably not an issue).\r\nOne can also bring the same \"devil's advocate\" argument about the `toJson` + `JsonWriter`: you can easily toJson to a String and write it yourself in a writer.\r\nTo apply the workaround you have to either do it every time you invoke `toJson`, or wrap the whole gson in a custom class that does that.\r\n\r\nSo, there are workarounds, but at the core this makes the people who need Windows EOL feel like second class citizens.\r\n\r\nWhen the JSON spec (and ECMAScript spec) does not specify a certain EOL as preferred, they accept all the valid combinations.\r\n\r\nIn fact there is an effort to update the spec to also allow for `U+2028` (LINE SEPARATOR) and `U+2029` (PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR), to bring JSON closer to ECMAScript:\r\nhttps://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-superset/blob/master/README.md\r\nApparently _\"It is already implemented in Chrome 66 and Safari TP49\"_ (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1435828). And in progress (or done?) in Firefox.\r\nSo being able to specify that as EOL would be nice. If it's valid / standard, why not?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway...\r\nAbout the implementation, if you are open to accept a contribution,\r\nI would be happy to make this change follow the direction you suggest.\r\n\r\nMaybe move this discussion into an issue, so that you can review the direction before I implement something debatable?\r\n\r\nI would probably go with a more \"fluent\"

for those further details!\r\n\r\nI'm not reading the business about LINE SEPARATOR and PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR the same as you. My understanding is that JavaScript previously did not allow these characters unescaped inside string literals, while JSON always has. So \"a`U+2028`b\" was legal in JSON but not in JavaScript, even though JSON is supposed to be a subset of JavaScript. The proposal was then to change JavaScript so it _does_ allow `U+2028` and `U+2029` in string literals, and that seems to have been [incorporated](https://262.ecma-international.org/10.0/#prod-LineTerminator) into the ECMAScript 2019 spec. So any well-formed JSON is indeed well-formed JavaScript. I don't see any suggestion of allowing `U+2028` _outside_ string literals in JSON. The allowed whitespace characters remain exactly `\\t`, `\\n`, `\\r`, and `\\u0020` and it would not be legal to use `U+2028` to separate lines when pretty-printing.\r\n\r\nFor the `FormattingStyle` API, my sketch suggested this (for example): `FormattingStyle.DEFAULT.withNewline(\"\\r\\n\").withIndent(\"\\t\")`. That's basically the same as what you wrote except for the `with` prefix and the need to start with `DEFAULT`. (I'm not sure what `style` is above?) I think `withX` names may make it clearer that the calls don't modify the object they are called on but instead return a new object (if necessary). An alternative would be to have a builder, but that seems like overkill.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be averse to having `public static final String CRLF = \"\\r\\n\";` in `FormattingStyle`, since there doesn't seem to be such a constant in the standard Java API. But I don't think we really need an enum here. (And maybe some people might find it useful to use `\"\\n\\n\"` or `\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"` as a line separator.)","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/comments/1320573631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"eamonnmcmanus","id":5246810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDY4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5246810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus","html_url":"https://github.com/eamonnmcmanus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/comments/1320606063","html_url":"https://github.com/google/gson/issues/776#issuecomment-1320606063","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/776","id":1320606063,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfCA985Ottlv","user":{"login":"mihnita","id":1307726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDc3MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1307726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihnita","html_url":"https://github.com/mihnita","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihnita/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihnita/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihnita/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihnita/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihnita/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihnita/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihnita/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihnita/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mihnita/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-18T22:36:37Z","updated_at":"2022-11-18T22:36:37Z","body":"\r\nThanks, I'll go ahead with `FormattingStyle.DEFAULT` and `withX`, and I will implement `withIndent` and `withNewline` taking a `String`.\r\n\r\nIt is your call if it is handy to define some constants (CR / CRLF / LF / OS_DEFAULT / WINDOWS / MACOS / LINUX / ...)\r\nBased on experience (and an informal \"survey\") many devs don't know what the mapping is between `CR`, `\"\\r\"`, `U+000D`, or what kind of end of line is used by each OS.
