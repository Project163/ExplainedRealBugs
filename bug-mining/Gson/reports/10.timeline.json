It's still concerning that the same date string doesn't parse on all platforms, but I'm not sure how or whether we can fix that. At least making the per-platform strings explicit would be better than simply not running the test on platforms other than 11.

That means potentially every Java version can format the date in different way. \r\n\r\nHere an example:\r\nIn Java 8 (with the `CLRD` system property set) a date is formatted in this way: `Tue, 16 Jul 2019 14:35:02 AEST` \r\nIn Java 9 (`CLRD` is set by default) a date is formatted in this different way: `Tue., 16 Jul. 2019 14:35:52 AEST` \r\n\r\nBetween the two dates there are only small differences but is enough to make the test fail because if the  date pattern change also the date format should change. \r\n\r\nIn fact, to pass the test ([as i write above](https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2199#issuecomment-1349367784)) it was enough to change the date format to pass the test ( from: `1 janv. 1970%s00:00:00` to: `1 janv. 1970, 00:00:00%s`).\r\n\r\n## Practical part\r\nProbably the first thing that we can do is say \"goodbye\" to the old date-time API and use the new one: `java.time`. Maybe just the switch to the new API can solve some problems. \r\n\r\nOr we can keep use if/ternary operator to identify the java version and pass the correct date format but this is not a solution for the problem so i hope we don't go for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/comments/1351558570/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MaicolAntali","id":79454487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDU0NDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79454487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicolAntali","html_url":"https://github.com/MaicolAntali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicolAntali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicolAntali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicolAntali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicolAntali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicolAntali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicolAntali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicolAntali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicolAntali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicolAntali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/comments/1351748398","html_url":"https://github.com/google/gson/issues/2199#issuecomment-1351748398","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/2199","id":1351748398,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAfCA985Qkgsu","user":{"login":"eamonnmcmanus","id":5246810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDY4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5246810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus","html_url":"https://github.com/eamonnmcmanus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eamonnmcmanus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-14T16:41:43Z","updated_at":"2022-12-14T16:41:43Z","body":"If these long-format dates are _parsed_ differently on the different platforms then the easiest thing is probably not to try to parse them.

don't know what to make of this, whether its a bug or not - but I think its worth mentioning. If you serialize a `java.util.Date` object, this is what you get with gson 2.8.0\r\n\r\n**Java 8** `{\"creationDate\":\"Jun 10, 2020 11:13:39 AM\"}`\r\n**Java 11** `{\"creationDate\":\"Jun 10, 2020, 11:14:17 AM\"}`\r\n\r\nsee the extra `,` after the year? Java 11 serialized java.util.Date is not deserializable in Java 8.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/1719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gson/issues/1719/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
