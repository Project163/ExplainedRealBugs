One that holds all of the models for the solution, and a web app as the second project. When I put the validators into the class library project, it does not have access to the db context. When I put the validators into the web app, the models in the class library cannot see the validators. I noticed there is a similar situation recorded earlier, but, the answer was for someone using .net core. I am not, which changes where the configuration of FluentValidation is defined. Is it even possible to do this without using .net core?","closed_by":{"login":"kjocon","id":38893865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODkzODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38893865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon","html_url":"https://github.com/kjocon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/744/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/744/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
