See the code below, the expected result would be that all three Foo instances are validated to be false, however the middle one is validated to be true, even though remark is not filled. It does seem to be working when validating AllRuleSets, however we have rulesets for Create and Update seperate and do not want to validate them all. It also works when setting a validtor using SetValidator() within the RuleForEach, this solves the issue for now, but it is not the way I would like to write this specific validator.
