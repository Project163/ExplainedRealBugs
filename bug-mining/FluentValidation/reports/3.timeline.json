That being said, often this kind of separation is completely unnecessary and it's simpler to contain everything in a single project with namespaces/directories providing separation.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/comments/385893527/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JeremySkinner","id":90130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner","html_url":"https://github.com/JeremySkinner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/comments/386032526","html_url":"https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/744#issuecomment-386032526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/744","id":386032526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjAzMjUyNg==","user":{"login":"kjocon","id":38893865,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODkzODY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38893865?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon","html_url":"https://github.com/kjocon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjocon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-02T16:09:46Z","updated_at":"2018-05-02T16:19:33Z","body":"Thank you for getting back so quickly. I was following a recommended structure that allowed my Identity data and app data to be in two separate contexts, but, one database. I don't believe it is possible to move the app data context into the model class project. Either way, I understand that there isn't really anything to be done with FluentValidation. I just need to be able to reference it from wherever I use it. Thank you Jeremy!
