The fix for that issue was to ensure that the parent ruleset was copied to the child rules ([see this code](https://github.com/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/blob/56313e7a7840b57762827c4780483903bf66c0a5/src/FluentValidation/DefaultValidatorExtensions.cs#L1209)), however this only happens at the top level. Multiple nested levels of child rules isn't a use case that was considered, which is why you're running into this issue. I believe the fix is that we need to recursively find all calls to ChildRules and apply the same change there. I'll look at getting that changed, although I'm not sure what the best approach is yet.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I wouldn't recommend structuring validators like this - multiple levels of child rules like this is incredibly hard to read. Using `SetValidator` with a dedicated child validator is the recommended approach for handling complex validation logic for nested types. \r\n\r\nI don't have time to work on this properly at the moment, but I'll let you know when I have a further update. \r\n\r\nEdit: I have a prototype of a fix in #2098 but will need to take some time to work out if this is the best approach","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/comments/1494496278/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JeremySkinner","id":90130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner","html_url":"https://github.com/JeremySkinner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8914323149,"node_id":"AE_lADOAAbGOs5iOnlWzwAAAAITVcbN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/events/8914323149","actor":{"login":"JeremySkinner","id":90130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner","html_url":"https://github.com/JeremySkinner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-03T15:21:23Z","assignee":{"login":"JeremySkinner","id":90130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner","html_url":"https://github.com/JeremySkinner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"JeremySkinner","id":90130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner","html_url":"https://github.com/JeremySkinner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JeremySkinner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-03T15:34:12Z","updated_at":"2023-04-03T15:34:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/2098","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FluentValidation/FluentValidation","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FluentValidation/FluentValidation/issues/2098/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FluentValidation/Fl
