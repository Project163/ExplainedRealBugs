there! Thanks a lot for your work on Alacritty, this project been helpful for me in countless ways, so I want to contribute something back. This PR implements `--hold` flag together with the `hold` configuration option which keeps Alacritty open after its child process exits.\r\n\r\nMaybe I should clarify why I decided to put the `hold` flag in the `Term` struct instead of passing it directly to the `EventLoop` where the handling of child process exit happens. I've tried this approach first, but it turned out to be extremely hard to write a test for (at least for me, I'm a total noob in Rust). I've also tried ref-tests, but for some reason, even with just opening and closing Alacritty I get 60 megabytes of `grid.json`, and a generated ref test is always failing. I'm not sure why it happens as I'm not very familiar with how `Grid` works yet.\r\n\r\nSo I've taken the easy-to-test approach, I hope it's good enough
