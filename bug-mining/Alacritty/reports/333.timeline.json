repos are saying 0.5 but alacritty itself is reporting 0.6.0-dev. manpages are also for 0.6.0-dev\r\n\r\n@mmstick @pvonmoradi it seems like the way version was built and deployed in PPA is faulty. The way it should be done is by using the sources we provide on release page, and so the version will be actually correct. Here it seems like the version was built of source from master branch, which is not representing release in any way, since that's the only way to get `alacritty 0.6.0-dev` as version.\r\n\r\nIf you've used the sources from master, there's likely a change that they don't match the ones we have on a release page, since master is tracking the current development, and so you may miss certain fixes or include the features which shouldn't belong to 0.5.0 candidate.\r\n\r\nIf you use our sources from release page you'll see, and that's actually a 0.5.0 release.\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/downloads/alacritty-0.5.0 ➜ cargo run -- --version 2> /dev/null\r\nalacritty 0.5.0\r\n\r\n```","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/667731391/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3613716637,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzYxMzcxNjYzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3613716637","actor":{"login":"pvonmoradi","id":1058151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi","html_url":"https://github.com/pvonmoradi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-02T22:15:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3613716638,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2MTM3MTY2Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3613716638","actor":{"login":"pvonmoradi","id":1058151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi","html_url":"https://github.com/pvonmoradi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvonmoradi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-02T22:15:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
