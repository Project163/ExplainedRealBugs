While on the system76 ppa it is up to date, unfortunately the one we link to is still on 0.4.1.\r\n\r\n@mmstick are you still updating the popos one? IIRC yours came before that, right? If not, should our documentation be updated? It has been a while since I've used a ppa or Ubuntu at all, but I feel like adding the system76 ppa might create troubles since it provides a ton of other packages which will probably be picked over the official ones available from Ubuntu.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3863/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
