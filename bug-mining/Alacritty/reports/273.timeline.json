There are a couple of sequences where Alacritty's responses doesn't match what Emacs expects:\r\n\r\n* `\\e[>0c` - Emacs expects `\\e[>N1;N2;N3c`, where N1 represents the terminal type (xterm responds with 41 - vt420), N2 is the xterm version (e.g. 347), and N3 is 0. Emacs' regex requires N3==0, but the other could be more or less anything, though is does use N2 to determine which features it should enable. It also special cases responses from e.g. Gnome Terminal and screen, but otherwise expects an \"xterm-like\" response.\r\n\r\n* `\\e]11;?\\e\\\\` (report background color). Emacs expects an ST terminator in the response (`\\e\\\\`), while Alacritty terminates with BEL (btw, xterm parrots the query's terminator in its responses). This _might_ be what causes the temporary hang; Emacs is waiting for an ST terminator that never comes, but thankfully times out after a while.\r\n\r\nNote: using BEL as response terminator will
