the cell dimensions from going below 1, this bug resulted in\r\nallocation of large amounts of memory in the scrollback PR but is also\r\npresent on master.\r\n\r\nCurrently the approach is to just `panic!`, however an `eprintln!` and\r\n`exit` could be an alternative too. I don't think it's realistic to\r\ncheck this at startup and it should have no performance impact since the\r\nfailing method is only called once at startup.\r\n\r\nTo make it a bit more clear what kind of values are accepted, the\r\ndatatypes of offsets and paddings have also been changed so that these\r\ndon't accept floats anymore and padding can never be negative.\r\n\r\nThis should allow us to be a bit more strict with the config to make\r\nsure that errors are printed when invalid values are specified (like\r\nnegative padding).\r\n\r\nThis fixes #1167.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1517421243,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MTUxNzQyMTI0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1517421243","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-12T22:41:46Z","label":{"name":"Project: Scrollback","color":"7de8d9"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
