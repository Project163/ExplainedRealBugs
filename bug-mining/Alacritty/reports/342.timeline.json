Even if you try to be xterm compatible, there's always going to be cases when you aren't. Using your own terminfo allows you to more easily compensate for that. \r\n\r\nLong answer:\r\n\r\nRelying on the system's xterm terminfo entries means you don't really know what you're getting. A new ncurses release may bring in changes that are in conflict with alacritty's implementation, and you would probably not notice it.\r\n\r\nAlso, by using your own terminfo, you can more precisely describe alacritty. You could, in theory, make xterm incompatible changes and, assuming you update the terminfo data, still work. At least with well behaving applications.\r\n\r\nYou could probably connect the terminfo description to at least some of the key bindings and the escape sequences they generate. I.e. generate either one of them from the other.\r\n\r\nLooking at other projects, there appear to be different views on what's \"correct\".\r\n\r\nThe konsole maintainer has stated (https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145977) that he prefers users to set `TERM=xterm(-256color)`, because he wants konsole to be 100% xterm compatible, and if something doesn't work the same way, it's a konsole bug.\r\n\r\nBoth st and urxvt on the other hand, have their own (complete) terminfo definitions.\r\n\r\nI think the advantages of **not** relying on (unknown) system definitions outweigh any potential downsides. At least initially, I would model the definition after xterm's; split it up into the same \"features\" and combine them into the final `alacritty` definition in the same way xterm's terminfo is done.\r\n\r\nThat way, it's fairly easy to pull in \"upstream\" changes from new ncurses releases, should it be necessary (I'm thinking for example bug fixes to terminfo definitions).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/409659033/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dnkl","id":14031526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDMxNTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14031526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl","html_url":"https://github.com/dnkl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dnkl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1765828402,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc2NTgyODQwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1765828402","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-01T17:38:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1765828403,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3NjU4Mjg0MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1765828403","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-01T17:38:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/409673655","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1485#issuecomment-409673655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1485","id":409673655,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTY3MzY1NQ==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-01T18:23:01Z","updated_at":"2018-08-01T18:23:01Z","body":"I also strongly support the decision to get a completely custom terminfo that doesn't rely on any other terminfo that already exist.

When leaving neovim with custom cursors for insert/replace/normal enabled, the cursor is not automatically reset to the default cursor in xterm-256color since xterm doesn't support the escape sequence to reset the cursor shape to the default cursor.
