As far as I can tell all three described options are 'correct', though our option right now is not very practical and potentially confusing.\r\n\r\nI feel like it's also important to note that URxvt behaves the same way that Alacritty does today. While it's hardly modern and focused on being simple to use, it is one of the biggest terminal emulators out there. Kitty behaves the same way.\r\n\r\n> The proposal is to add an option to the configuration for how to handle `ClearMode::All`\r\n\r\nI don't think this is necessary. I don't recall anyone explicitly requesting XTerm's behavior and it would be simple to recreate yourself with escape sequences if you *really* wanted that. So I'd keep the config clean and just shift everything up.\r\n\r\n> It sounds like a VTE behavior, so maybe it should be the default.\r\n\r\nI don't think only because VTE behaves a certain way, it should be the default option, when evidently a lot of other terminal emulators behave differently. However, I think in this case VTE has made the best choice for the users so following that lead makes sense to me.\r\n\r\nThe only disadvantage to my proposed solution would be that it will be impossible to remove everything currently visible from the history forever without also clearing the full history.
