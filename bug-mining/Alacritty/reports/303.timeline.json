trying to use a font (Monaco) that does not have an italic / bold variant. Until now I relied upon FreeType having the ability to create these missing styles, and it works like a charm in e.g urxvt `URxvt.font: xft:Monaco:weight=200:size=10`, st `static char *font = \"Monaco:weight=200:size=10\";` and other software like vscode. I tried adding the `weight` property to the alacritty config:\r\n```yaml\r\n # Bold font face\r\n  bold:\r\n    family: Monaco\r\n    weight: 200\r\n```\r\nHowever it doesn't seem to work, and I didn't find detailed documentation on this other than the comments in the default conf. [This](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/font_configuration#Create_bold_and_italic_styles_for_incomplete_fonts) might be a solution, but the cache location `/usr/share/fonts/fonts.cache-1` looks to be outdated, I need to delve into that.\r\n\r\nI'm new to the Linux font stack (Arch, X11), please let me know if something I assumed is incorrect or I missed any clearly written documentation.
