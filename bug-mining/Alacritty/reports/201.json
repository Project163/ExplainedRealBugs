With \"angle brackets\" here I specifically mean these two Unicode codepoints:\r\n\r\n- [U+27E8](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/27e8/index.htm) (`⟨`)\r\n- [U+27E9](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/27e9/index.htm) (`⟩`)\r\n\r\nThese angle brackets are rendered in manual pages when the `.UR`+`.UE` combination of groff macros is used ([see here](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/groff_man.7.html)). Since this is the recommended way to format URLs and e-mails in man pages, it is a quite common scenario (see for example `man 1 proxy`, `man 1 groff`, `man 1 script`, `man 1 renice`).\r\n\r\nIn particular, Alacritty identifies the closing angle bracket as part of the URL, while it is not, so in something like this:\r\n\r\n    ⟨https://example.com/x/y⟩\r\n\r\nthe identified URL is:\r\n\r\n    https://example.com/x/y⟩\r\n\r\nwhile it should be:\r\n\r\n    https://example.com/x/y","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2629/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2629/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
