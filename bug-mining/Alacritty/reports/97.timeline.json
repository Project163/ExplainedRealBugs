It would probably allow easier navigation and search too, since Alacritty's scrollback buffer currently isn't searchable.\r\n\r\nI think the situation of large scrollback buffers can definitely be improved in the future, but even if the memory is dynamically allocated, if the 1 million lines are completely filled, that will not make any difference. Offloading to a file would be a potential solution for something like that, but it would introduce a lot of additional complexity and require synchronization. So that's probably far, far in the future, or potentially completely out of scope.\r\n\r\nReducing the actual storage size by trimming down on things like the cell or row size would always be an option, with a million lines even a difference like u64 vs u32 for every row can already cause a memory consumption of multiple megabytes. If this affects every cell there's definitely going to be a large impact. However Alacritty definitely isn't completely wasteful in this area, so it's not a super simple optimization to make.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day Alacritty's goal is still performance though, so when offloading more stuff into memory significantly improves performance, but makes large history buffers less feasible, Alacritty's choice would probably be the performance improvement. Hopefully there's going to be a solution that helps out everyone, but that's not always simple.\r\n\r\nIt's always appreciated if people with different workflows and experiences are available to test out changes though.

This had the effect that terminals which aren't making\r\nuse of the scrollback buffer yet, would still consume large amounts of\r\nmemory, potentially even freezing the system at startup.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this problem, the grid is now dynamically resized in chunks\r\nof `1000` rows. The initial size is just the visible area itself, then\r\nevery time lines are written to the terminal emulator, the grid storage\r\nis grown when required.\r\n\r\nWith the worst-case scenario of having 100_000 lines scrollback\r\nconfigured, this change improves startup performance at the cost of\r\nscrolling performance.\r\n\r\nOn my machine the startup changes from ~0.3 to ~0.2 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe scrolling performance with large throughput is not affected, however\r\nit is slowed down when the number of lines scrolled are close to the\r\n100_000 configured as scrollback. The most taxing benchmark I've found\r\nfor this was running `yes | dd count=500 > 500.txt` (note the relatively\r\nsmall file size). This will cause a slowdown on the first run from 0.05s\r\nto 0.15s. While this is significant, it lines up with the time saved at\r\nstartup.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #1236.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** I have not mentioned the memory difference at startup in the\r\ncommit message, so here's the comparison for 100k lines of scrollback:\r\n\r\n| Master | PR |\r\n| - | - |\r\n| 571M | 74K |","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1584/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1584/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1863883998,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg2Mzg4Mzk5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1863883998","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-24T18:40:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1863884239,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4NjM4ODQyMzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1863884239","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3d7e88e8a975f40996aaa71d951842db6f2fccbb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/commits/3d7e88e8a975f40996aaa71d951842db6f2fccbb","created_at":"2018-09-24T18:40:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/424098031","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1236#issuecomment-424098031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1236","id":424098031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDA5ODAzMQ==","user":{"login":"haarp","id":781030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTAzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/781030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haarp","html_url":"https://github.com/haarp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haarp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haarp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haarp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haarp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haarp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haarp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haarp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haarp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haarp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-24T19:35:49Z","updated_at":"2018-09-24T19:35:49Z","body":"Thank you!
