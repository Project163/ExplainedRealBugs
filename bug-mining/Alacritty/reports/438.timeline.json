At least the contrast of that green to your cursor's yellow is extremely low.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly do you want to change, just to lower the threshold? The current threshold is a contrast of `1.5`, with your yellow on green being `1.3`. The lowest possible value is `1.0`, the highest is `21`, while I think the lowest acceptable contrast for text according to the W3C is 3 with large text.\r\n\r\nSo I have very little doubt a contrast of 1.3 justifies switching out the colors. Even if we were to reduce it even more we'd have to use at most `1.2` for your example to work.

of interest, what algorithm does Alacritty use to calculate contrast, and how much does it take hue into consideration?

@chrisduerr I experimented a bit since I think I'm having the same issue (see also my comment [here](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2398#issuecomment-872059754)). It seems that whenever you set both `text` and `cursor` in `colors: cursor` then the cursor becomes invisible within search matches in vim. It doesn't matter what color you set them to. I try many different, having them different, the same etc. If you only set one of them then the cursor will be visible in some way but not the way, I want to fit the colorscheme.\r\n\r\nEdit: After trying a bit more I can only say that I have no idea what's going on, at least the gruvbox scheme from here does not work:\r\nhttps://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/wiki/Color-schemes\r\n\r\nEdit:
