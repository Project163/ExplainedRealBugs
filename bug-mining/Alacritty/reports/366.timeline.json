I have seen plenty of users that would run into problems with that and not understand why it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nWhat if I want the literal, not the expansion?\r\n\r\nGenerally shell glob expansion is exactly that, a shell thing. Same for environment variables. For script-like configuration files like i3's config this makes sense and in fact I use $HOME in my config. But for a yaml file I'm not so sure. Relative paths should work, so that could help a little bit, but that would be rather messy when starting things from the CLI.\r\n\r\n@nixpulvis Would you want this only for paths, or for all environment variables that are strings? Also are you only interested in $HOME or are there other environment variables you might want to use?\r\n\r\nI could see just replacing $HOME or ~ maybe.

solution to @nixpulvis problem would be to support relative paths for the import section. Paths would be relative to the file they are defined in. \r\n\r\nFor example, you are using the default configuration location `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty`. You have broken up your configuration into categories. You directory structure might look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.config/alacritty ➜ tree .\r\n.\r\n|-- alacritty.yml\r\n|-- config\r\n    |-- functional.yml\r\n    |-- input.yml\r\n    |-- theme.yml\r\n    `-- visual.yml\r\n````\r\n\r\nIn your entry point of your configuration your import section would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```yml\r\nimports:\r\n  - config/functional.yml\r\n  - config/input.yml\r\n  - config/theme.yml\r\n  - config/visual.yml\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs these are relative paths they are relative to the entry file that they were defined in (`~/.config/alacritity/alacritty.yml`) in this example.\r\n\r\n@nixpulvis would this help in the mean time while Path/Env expansion is figured out. @chrisduerr your thoughts as well?
