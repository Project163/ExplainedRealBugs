Here's the feedback I got in IRC about the best way to do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n13:28 <jwilm> I'd like to handle errors in Alacritty's config deserializer by substituting default values or simply omitting failed entries that are part of a sequence. Is https://serde.rs/ignored-any.html the best example of how to achieve this sort of thing?\r\n14:04 <dtolnay> rovar: the serde(skip) not doing anything is a bug but that should work eventually https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/1048\r\n14:04 <dtolnay> rovar: for now i think the impl you wrote is the best way\r\n14:04 <dtolnay> jwilm: IgnoredAny will not let you omit failing entries in a sequence\r\n14:05 <dtolnay> jwilm: you only get to deserialize each entry once, so you cannot try to deserialize it to T, see that it failed, and deserialize it instead to IgnoredAny\r\n14:05 <dtolnay> jwilm: i would suggest deserializing each sequence entry to serde_yaml::Value which always succeeds as long as the yaml is syntactically fine\r\n14:05 <dtolnay> jwilm: then try to deserialize the Value to a T\r\n```\r\n\r\nfyi @dtolnay added your comments

Assuming that all fallback values for one deserializer are the same.\r\n\r\nBut even tho it would be great to have this for every value, it seems to me like it would require a custom deserializer for every type we have.\r\n\r\nAlacritty definitely needs to start no matter what's inside the config though. As someone that doesn't have any editor except for neovim, I really don't want to switch to the tty to fix my alacritty config when all my terminals are closed.\r\n
