Though as mentioned previously I'd have to setup a Debian VM to test what the best solution would be. On Arch /lib/terminfo is symlinked to /usr/share/terminfo, so it wouldn't work, however if this is not the case on Debian and it's still loaded, that would be a great option.\r\n\r\nOn Debian and derivatives, /lib/terminfo will most likely never be a symlink to /usr/share/terminfo (unless the local admin has made one, and then they keep the pieces). \r\n\r\n> I think we can just execute `tic` in the `extra/linux/debian/positinst` script, however we'd still have to first copy it somewhere.\r\n\r\nI had thought of running tic at package build time, but that does not seem possible with cargo-deb.  So you would probably have to include alacritty.info in the .deb, say in /usr/share/alacritty, and then use maintainerscripts like these (untested):\r\n\r\npostinst:\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\nset -e\r\ntic -x -o /lib/terminfo /usr/share/alacritty/alacritty.info\r\n```\r\nprerm:\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\nset -e\r\nrm -f /lib/terminfo/alacritty /lib/terminfo/alacritty+common /lib/terminfo/alacritty-direct\r\n```","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/516971362/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zwenna","id":105270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTI3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwenna","html_url":"https://github.com/zwenna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwenna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwenna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwenna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwenna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwenna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwenna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwenna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwenna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zwenna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/517147734","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2685#issuecomment-517147734","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2685","id":517147734,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNzE0NzczNA==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-01T06:58:19Z","updated_at":"2019-08-01T06:58:19Z","body":"> I had thought of running tic at package build time, but that does not seem possible with cargo-deb.

Also `/lib` is a symlink to `/usr/lib` in case it's useful.\r\n\r\nAbout `TERM=alacritty`, it works after installing the `.deb` (assuming you mean `$ env | grep TERM`, if not, please let me know what to check exactly). And it still seems to work even after I remove the terminfo file from `/usr/share/terminfo/a/` so I suspect I might be doing something wrong.\r\n\r\n@zwenna on my system, `tic` compiles the terminfo files to `/lib/terminfo/a/alacritty*` when I run `sudo tic -x -o /lib/terminfo /usr/share/alacritty/alacritty.info` so the `prerm` script probably won't remove them properly.\r\n\r\nHope the above helps.

Also `/lib` is a symlink to `/usr/lib` in case it's useful.\r\n\r\nShould not matter if /lib is a symlink to /usr/lib or a directory.\r\n\r\n> About `TERM=alacritty`, it works after installing the `.deb` (assuming you mean `$ env | grep TERM`, if not, please let me know what to check exactly). And it still seems to work even after I remove the terminfo file from `/usr/share/terminfo/a/` so I suspect I might be doing something wrong.\r\n\r\nThe .deb installs the terminfo files under /lib/terminfo, so removing files from /usr/share/terminfo has no effect, that is to be expected.\r\n\r\n> @zwenna on my system, `tic` compiles the terminfo files to `/lib/terminfo/a/alacritty*` when I run `sudo tic -x -o /lib/terminfo /usr/share/alacritty/alacritty.info` so the `prerm` script probably won't remove them properly.\r\n\r\nThanks, fixed that and force-pushed my branch.
