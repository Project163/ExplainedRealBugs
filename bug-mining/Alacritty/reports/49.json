The same does happen with terminology terminal, but doesn't happen with xterm / urxvt / vte-based terminals.\r\n\r\nThe corruption looks like this:\r\n\r\n![2017-08-21-230625_774x445_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1618371/29566757-3208da02-874b-11e7-88db-8dd7b9b852c3.png)\r\n\r\nFew days ago I've opened issue with tmux project (tmux/tmux#1040) and tmux author has been very helpful in getting to the bottom of it. It is possible that there is an issue with alacritty's handling of \"scroll regions\" / \"change_scroll_region\" capability. Tmux author has come up with the test case that allows to reproduce the issue under alacritty, without tmux:\r\n\r\n[xtest.txt](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/files/1242071/xtest.txt)\r\n\r\nTo execute it:\r\n\r\n    clear; cat xtest.txt; sleep 100\r\n\r\nResults under xterm:\r\n\r\n![2017-08-22-150134_611x443_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1618371/29566735-23fa2e52-874b-11e7-8c39-a45f818dd7fb.png)\r\n\r\nResults under alacirtty:\r\n\r\n![2017-08-22-150131_777x533_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1618371/29566743-2814026a-874b-11e7-8ea1-ecc17fc7fe2f.png)\r\n\r\nThis may be related to #678. There is also tmux issue tmux/tmux#1040. I'll be happy to provide additional details.\r\n\r\nI'm running alacritty version 471237d2ced1d1a07de06d832b2902efbc237df9 (`alacritty --versions` says 0.1.0) with mostly default configuration (I've changed only color scheme and shell) under linux.
