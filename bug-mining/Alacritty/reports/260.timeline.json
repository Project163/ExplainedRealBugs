right, it took me a while but I managed to reproduce at least something! Here's what I've got:\r\n\r\n1. `tmux-yank` doesn't have any issue, how ever I try to select, it just works flawlessly.\r\n2. `MouseDragEnd1Pane` is the issue, when it is *not unbound*! By default, `MouseDragEnd1Pane` is bound to [copy-selection-and-cancel](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/06684c93de3e5fbc01bf6749c62defffaa07c52c/key-bindings.c#L274), and this is what copies only parts of the selection. As soon as I add `unbind -T copy-mode MouseDragEnd1Pane`, the default copy doesn't kick in anymore and I can use `y` to copy text with `tmux-yank` and it always copies the selection in full.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I reproduce the issue with the default behavior of `MouseDragEnd1Pane`. I don't reproduce in in daily usage because in my own `.tmux.conf` I also do `unbind -T copy-mode MouseDragEnd1Pane` and I always use `tmux-yank`, which seems to work flawlessly.\r\n\r\nAlternative to unbinding `MouseDragEnd1Pane` is to add `set -g set-clipboard off` to your `.tmux.conf`, this basically disables (broken) automatic copy on selection.\r\n\r\nAnd now it all makes sense, because `set-clipboard` was implemented only recently in https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/pull/970. \r\n\r\nLet's kindly invite @geertj to the thread. TL;DR: `set-clipboard` doesn't copy the entire selection.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/356120098/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"max-baz","id":1177900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzc5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1177900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz","html_url":"https://github.com/max-baz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1414602226,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQxNDYwMjIyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1414602226","actor":{"login":"geertj","id":796683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/796683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj","html_url":"https://github.com/geertj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-08T22:42:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1414602227,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0MTQ2MDIyMjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1414602227","actor":{"login":"geertj","id":796683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/796683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj","html_url":"https://github.com/geertj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-08T22:42:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/356480674","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1002#issuecomment-356480674","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1002","id":356480674,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjQ4MDY3NA==","user":{"login":"geertj","id":796683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/796683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj","html_url":"https://github.com/geertj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geertj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-10T02:27:28Z","updated_at":"2018-01-10T02:28:08Z","body":"@maximbaz, I've not used `tmux-yank` myself, but from your description I understand that it's a tmux plugin to copy a selection to the system clipboard. Do you know how it does that? Does it use the OSC 52 escape code that #970 implemented? I guess not, because that's only there since last week.\r\n\r\nSince tmux-yank and set-clipboard do essentially the same thing, I think you'd have to use one or the other. If you disable tmux-yank and enable set-clipboard, do you still see partial data on the clipboard? If so, could you add a `println!()` to the OSC 52 handler in `src/ansi.rs` to see if it may be called multiple times, and what the parameters are? \r\n\r\n \r\n
