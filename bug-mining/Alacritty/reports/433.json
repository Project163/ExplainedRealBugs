I propose that\nthis should change to allow Error and Warn level messages to come through from such crates\nwhen `alacritty` is run with the `-vvv` option.\n\nThe `-vvv` option enables Trace level log messages so additional detail from dependant crates\nwon't be completly out of place.\n\nThis additional debugging information would allow for addtional options for diagnosing errors.\nFor example, if this had been in place then it would have shown an Error level log messages from\n`smithay-client-toolkit` for #4780. The \"fail silently\" part of my comment on that issue is\nin part an `alacritty` issue, not just a `winit` issue.\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5387/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5387/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
