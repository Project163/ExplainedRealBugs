Which operating system does the issue occur on?\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n> If on linux, are you using X11 or Wayland?\r\nX11\r\n\r\nI could have sworn this was fixed in the past. But I can not find the previous issue for this, so I guess this might have been on IRC (or it was only in my dreams...)\r\n\r\nThe issue is that mocp uses a terminal command to draw/redraw the progress bar. However it seems like this command is not working as it should in alacritty.\r\n\r\nThe issue happens when playing an audio file and the progress bar is moving along the bottom:\r\n![mocp2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/312503/50513401-e03dd980-0a97-11e9-80c3-a6edf6f861a0.png)\r\n\r\nThe the progress bar hits the same position as the square bracket time stamp, the left most cell will vanish and there will be a gap in the progress bar too.\r\n\r\nIIRC, this was a problem in the early days of alacritty too. But back then it was because the terminal command code used in this operation was not implemented. So this is a regression of sorts. But I don't know when the regression happened...\r\n\r\nThis happens with `TERM` set to either alacritty or xterm","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1933/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
