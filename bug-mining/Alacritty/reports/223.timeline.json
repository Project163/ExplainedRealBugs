If we just want to live update the default font size, things get much easier.\r\n\r\nThe font size update code can just be handled in the [terminal's config update handler](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/blob/master/alacritty_terminal/src/term/mod.rs#L926-L941) and we'd just need to check if the current font size is equal to the old default font size and if that's the case we can change it to the new font size.\r\n\r\nSince these two issues are so different in complexity, it probably makes sense to split them if someone is interested in going for the font size change. So handling them in separate PRs is no problem. If someone is doing the style reloading anyways, the size change shouldn't be much more complicated
