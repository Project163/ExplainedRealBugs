in Alacritty, it is possible to select any cell in the terminal, regardless of its occupational status. This is not ideal, because it does not correctly show the user any difference between a whitespace at the end of a line and the end of line itself.\r\n\r\nIdeally what we should be doing is either stop the selection at the last cell (which is what Kitty does), or we should extend the selection to the last column as soon as an empty cell is reached (which is what Termite and URxvt seem to do).\r\n\r\nI personally think what Kitty does is probably most 'natural' to the user here, since it only selects cells that are actually occupied, but I'm sure there are good arguments for the other

too.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3145/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3145/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mckellygit","id":67548250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTQ4MjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67548250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mckellygit","html_url":"https://github.com/mckellygit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mckellygit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mckellygit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mckellygit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mckellygit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mckellygit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mckellygit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mckellygit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mckellygit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mckellygit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-02T12:11:20Z","updated_at":"2021-05-02T12:11:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5050","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5050/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5050/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5050/events","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5050","id":873926895,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4NzM5MjY4OTU=","number":5050,"title":"crash
