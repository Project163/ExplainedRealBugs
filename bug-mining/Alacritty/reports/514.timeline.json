The things that were controversial in the last attempt --- selection, what happens when the finger moves horizontally, what multiple fingers do, what a hold means --- I really don't care about.\r\n\r\nSo: @chrisduerr, how would you feel, in principle, about a very minimal patch just to get \"tap = click\" functional? Would such an attempt be welcome, or would you rather have proper touchscreen support in one go? If you're okay with a small change that leaves the hard work undone and the hard decisions unmade, I'll try for it.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/897975605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bytbox","id":160033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bytbox","html_url":"https://github.com/bytbox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bytbox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bytbox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bytbox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bytbox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bytbox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bytbox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bytbox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bytbox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bytbox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5152251125,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTE1MjI1MTEyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/5152251125","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-12T21:19:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5152251131,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUxNTIyNTExMzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/5152251131","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-12T21:19:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/897988215","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3671#issuecomment-897988215","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3671","id":897988215,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxkop841hjZ3","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-12T21:44:31Z","updated_at":"2021-08-

is a baby step towards touch support: tapping will click, but no other touch functionality is available. It does most of what *I* want, but of course I can't vouch for anyone else...\r\n\r\nBecause of the simplicity of this change, there are a few strange behaviors. None of them seem to be \"biting\" or potentially harmful, but here's the ones I know of:\r\n\r\n- The message bar is not handled correctly. If you tap on the message bar, that gets interpreted as a click behind the message bar.\r\n- Dragging is not detected. That doesn't just mean you can't scroll; it also means that if you drag, it interprets it as a click at the last place your finger was.\r\n- Multitouch is totally ignored. If you put one finger down, then another, then lift the first, it interprets that as a \"click\". When you lift the second, that's another \"click\".\r\n\r\nNote (as mentioned in the commits) that this code essentially contains a workaround for winit issue 1996. The main part of that workaround is that it necessitates keeping track of a `TouchState` object --- that'll be necessary eventually anyway, so I don't feel guilty.\r\n\r\nI have added no tests, expecting that touch behavior will change substantially in the future, and those tests would need to be immediately re-written. Tests have been modified only to keep them compiling (necessary cuz of the additional variable tracking TouchState).\r\n\r\nFinally, a question: to detect the difference between a drag (to be ignored, for now) and a tap, it's necessary to have some sort of threshold, probably in distance moved. Is this worthy of adding a configuration option to alacritty.yml? I think the only real alternative is a hidden constant somewhere.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nScott","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/903724567","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3671#issuecomment-903724567","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3671","id":903724567,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxkop8413b4X","user":{"login":"Rasie1","id":7131341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzEzNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7131341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasie1","html_url":"https://github.com/Rasie1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasie1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasie1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasie1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasie1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasie1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasie1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasie1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasie1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rasie1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-23T12:35:50Z","updated_at":"2021-08-23T12:35:50Z","body":"On i3wm, sadly, alacritty doesn't react to touchscreen at all.
