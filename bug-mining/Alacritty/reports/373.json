This is what Firefox does by default and it's generally a good idea if you want to just repeat the last search.\r\n\r\nFirefox automatically selects the whole search text, this makes it possible to immediately type over the existing text. We have Ctrl+U to remove the entire line and start typing from nothing, but it would also be possible to clear the search text once the user starts typing. But I think the latter would be very confusing and thus pretty bad UX.\r\n\r\nWhile I think for viless search this would be a great option, I'm not sure if it should be done for vi search. It might be useful to somehow access the last search pattern, but autofilling it would seem  counterintuitive  to me as a vi user.\r\n\r\nOne problem with this is that it might immediately move the viewport when starting search, potentially confusing the user. A potential solution would be to just enter the text, without jumping to any search match. So the user would have to press <kbd>Enter</kbd> once to start search.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4095/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4095/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
