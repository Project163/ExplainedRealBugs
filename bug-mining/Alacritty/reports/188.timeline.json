adds a rough implementation of block selection with the goal of\r\ndoing a minimal number of modifications to the existing code.\r\n\r\nThis is super WIP and more a proposal of keeping track of block\r\nselection rather than an actual solution, it should provide all the\r\nfunctionality necessary, however the code quality is lacking.\r\n\r\nCurrently whenever selections are passed around in `term/mod` it just\r\nwaps it in either `BLOCK` or `SPAN` so consumers can check what kind of\r\nselection is present and decide based on it.\r\n\r\nThe alternative solutions that immediately come to mind would be\r\neither passing a boolean like `is_block_selection` whenever a method is\r\ncalled, wrap it in a struct with a boolean instead of using an enum for\r\nmatching, or the most drastic alternative would probably be to change\r\nthe selection model from something linear to an alternative which allows\r\nto display both linear and block selections.\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure myself what the preferred way of moving forward would\r\nbe here and it's very likely that there are also other (potentially much\r\nbetter?) solutions for this problem.\r\n\r\nThis fixes
