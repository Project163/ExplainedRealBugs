windows if I add the following keybind:\r\n\r\n      - { key: T,        mods: Control|Shift, command: {program: \"cmd\", args: []} }\r\n\r\nThen when I hit Ctrl+Shift+T, the following happens:\r\n\r\n- If the `Alacritty` instance running was launched from the desktop or taskbar, the `cmd` window immediately crashes.\r\n- If the `Alacritty` instance was launched from another terminal, then that terminal is taken over by the new `cmd` process (wat!)\r\n\r\nThe fault all seems to lie in the `spawn_daemon` function. I think to fix we would need to use windows APIs directly rather than `std::process::Command`, which is a bit sad.\r\n\r\nI will write up a PR, but I wanted to survey opinion first on what \"correct\" behaviour of this keybind should be. I propose the following:\r\n\r\nKeybind | Result\r\n------------ | -------------\r\n`{program: \"cmd\", args: []}` | New command window opens\r\n`{program: \"cmd\", args: [\"echo\", \"hello\"]}`| New command window opens, prints hello, immediately closes.\r\n`{program: \"foo\", args: []}`| Program \"foo\" opens in new window\r\n\r\nIn particular, in Linux daemons as I understand are background processes. So should there be any situations where I can spawn a process with a hidden console window?\r\n\r\nI discovered this while digging around with solving #1979.

OS escape code is used by libvte (on unix) and Terminal.app on macOS to inform the terminal emulator about the working directory.\r\n\r\nBy adding an OSC 7 message to the prompt (i.e. as libvte and Terminal.app do) Alacritty can be updated about the working directory of a child process, even on Windows. This technique also works for subshells, e.g. \r\n\r\n    Alacritty -> bash -> bash\r\n\r\nChecking `/proc` can only get the cwd of the \"root\" bash instance which Alacritty itself spawned, but this OSC 7 message can work for any depth of subshell as long as that subshell is sending the message (normally as part of its prompt).\r\n\r\nRelevant iterm2 issue where they added support: https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/3939\r\nThe Windows Terminal guys are also considering handling this: https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/3158\r\n\r\nSo in theory, this has the potential to fix #1979 for all platforms without `/proc`, but requires the user to customise their prompt a little.

For `cmd.exe`/`powershell.exe` that would be limited to WinAPI functions. So the actual code solution would be:\r\n- Have a DLL on Windows that can be loaded into `cmd.exe` process that, when [initialising](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-entry-point-function) runs `GetCurrentDirectory` and sends a message back to Alacritty process\r\n- Allacritty, after `cmd.exe` has started, runs `CreateRemoteThread` with a handler that would run [`LoadLibrary`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya) with that DLL path\r\n\r\nOverall the entire process sounds very iffy and error prone and can potentially trigger some AV scanners.\r\n\r\nThere is also an [alternative hack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14018280/how-to-get-a-process-working-dir-on-windows) where by reading a specific section of process memory it is possible to get its cwd. There is a C# version somewhere that works for both 32b and 64b systems but both use [`NtQueryInformationProcess`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/nf-winternl-ntqueryinformationprocess?redirectedfrom=MSDN) that is considered a private WinAPI method.\r\n\r\nThere might be something specific to `conhost.exe` that could potentially be used, but so far I haven't found a nice way of doing that, so while also not ideal, @davidhewitt solution

@cfiet.

So I'm really not fond of the DLL approach.\r\n\r\nYou might be interested in #2937 which would create a simple cross-platform solution that's already implemented in some other terminal emulators.
