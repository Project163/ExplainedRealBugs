However, there is a terminal escape sequence dedicated to set and unset this option.\r\n\r\nAccording to the XTerm documentation `CSI ? 1007 h` should enable sending arrow keys in the alternate screen mode and `CSI ? 1007 l` should disable it.\r\n\r\nXTerm by default has this option set to be disabled, so the first `CSI ? 1007 h` is required to enable it. With Termite it is enabled by default and `CSI ? 1007 l` has to be used to disable it by default. URxvt does not seem to support this.\r\n\r\nAlacritty should respect this option and enable/disable what we call faux scrolling using it. Additionally it might make sense to get rid of our configuration option, however that would remove the ability to have separate scroll modifiers for normal and faux scrolling.\r\n\r\nThe default of Alacritty should be to enable it, since this follows the example of what Termite does and is consistent with what Alacritty has been doing by itself so far.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2727/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2727/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
