If I want to scroll strictly vertically, I should move my fingers on touchpad strictly vertically too. I expected scroll to work like this: alacritty gets coordinates or direction, for example, {x = 20, y = 100} or 20 degrees to the right from vertical direction (it's not a accurate calculation), so alacritty desides, that the current scroll is vertical, because new point is closer to vertical direction. Something like this or disabling horizontal scroll in config can fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Linux/BSD/macOS/Windows\r\nmacOS\r\nVersion: `alacritty --version` output\r\n<img width=\"396\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26388769/219848562-9cf8f0be-9f12-419e-9dd6-701ca85b1b22.png\">\r\nLinux/BSD: X11/Wayland, DE or Compositor and WM\r\nNot applicable.\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\nCrashes: STDERR, STDOUT\r\nFont/Terminal size: `alacritty -vv`\r\nKeyboard and bindings: `alacritty --print-events`\r\nI don't think there is a need in logs.","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
