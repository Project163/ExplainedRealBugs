Implementing them isn't optional. In System 7 thru Mac OS 9, the OS populated the application menu automatically when the application initialized the menu bar. I'm not sure why Apple changed it in Mac OS X to require the application to be involved in the process, but they did, so that's what applications have to do now. If you create a new application in Xcode, all of this is handled automatically, but if Alacritty wasn't made using the Xcode application template then Alacritty gets to reimplement that functionality. #3245 already exists to cover the fact that Alacritty should implement the standard applications menu so I didn't think a separate ticket was needed for this sub-task of that issue, but if the developers want to track it separately that's up to them.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/629320571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ryandesign","id":429209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTIwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/429209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryandesign","html_url":"https://github.com/ryandesign","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryandesign/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryandesign/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryandesign/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryandesign/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryandesign/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryandesign/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryandesign/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryandesign/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryandesign/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/629328131","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3697#issuecomment-629328131","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3697","id":629328131,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyOTMyODEzMQ==","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-15T15:46:38Z","updated_at":"2020-05-15T15:46:38Z","body":"Ah that makes it clearer, thank you.
