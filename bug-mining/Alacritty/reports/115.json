I was unable to find the arguments in the error message (`[['1','0',],['?',],]`) in any other issue, so I opened a new one.\r\n\r\nThanks to the error log notification feature merged recently, I was made aware that every time I start vim an error occurs:\r\n```\r\n[2018-11-18 12:45] [WARN] [unhandled osc_dispatch]: [['1','0',],['?',],] at line 754\r\n[2018-11-18 12:45] [WARN] [unhandled osc_dispatch]: [['1','1',],['?',],] at line 754\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've reproduced the error with the default alacritty config and an empty vim config. It depends on the value of `$TERM`, setting it to `xterm-256colors` produces the error, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTERM=xterm-256color vim -u NONE -U NONE -N\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen setting `TERM=alacritty`, the error does not occur:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTERM=alacritty vim -u NONE -U NONE -N\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut then setting `termguicolors` make vim's output render in black and white (so no nice colors).\r\n\r\nOther random things I noticed:\r\n * It does not happen with neovim (with both values for `TERM`, version 0.3.1-1)\r\n * It does not happen with vim 8.0 (tested only via SSH to a system running Debian stable)\r\n\r\nAny idea what's going on here? Is there anything I can do to help?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your work on alacritty, I love it!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1809/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
