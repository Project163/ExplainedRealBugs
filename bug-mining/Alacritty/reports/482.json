So I assume that somehow the CLI value is ignored (probably because it sets the `instance` name and not `general`, see below).\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nThis is probably related to https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/commit/23915cfc5343859329731c50114f701997c29b1f, and in turn https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/commit/7d708d53f7ecb4c64db10ae44e7f4fca47c29a85 that caused the initial regression.\r\n\r\nI'm not very familiar with Rust or the Alacritty codebase. However I see that `winit` changed the API to use `with_name()` instead of `with_app_id()/with_class()` (https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/2250/commits/a78e801f13231f773e5d19818097f76f53a8b6d0) and this triggered the above changes. There I see that on Wayland the class `general` name is used as `app_id` and `instance` name is ignored.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be that `--class` sets the instance name instead (the previous invocation of `with_app_id()` used the `instance` name too) but the new `with_name()` ignores the instance name on Wayland.\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Linux\r\nVersion: alacritty 0.11.0-dev (23915cfc)\r\nLinux: Wayland, sway\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6279/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6279/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
