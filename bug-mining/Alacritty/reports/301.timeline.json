Fundamentally the problem is just that the deb we build will never work on more than a hand full of systems. So it's pointless and a waste of effort on our end. Alacritty's responsible for the code, not its distribution. That should be left up to distros and their maintainers.\r\n\r\nSo at that point the question is mostly what benefit we gain by providing a deb build for people that compile Alacritty from source. Unless you have a good argument while we should provide prebuilt debs.\r\n\r\nProviding the ability to build a deb is a bit annoying, since it requires a lot of integration from Alacritty. At the same time all the changes done by the deb can also be done by the user themselves. I'd assume the main reason behind a deb would be to make it easier to remove it?

That's almost 1/4th of the entire file for a distro specific thing. We support at least 4 platforms (BSD/Linux/macOS/Windows), of which some have multiple different distributions. If we would put this kind of workaround for every single one of them (which they equally deserve, there's nothing making Ubuntu special here), our `Cargo.toml` would probably be 90% stuff that shouldn't be in it in the first place.\r\n\r\nThis also adds two scripts to our repo, though those are rather irrelevant.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we now have a dependency on the `cargo-deb` tool. That means that we need to make sure that tool works with Alacritty and there's no security issues present. Thankfully I consider the maintainer trustworthy, but there are still maintenance problems. The latest version only works with Rust 1.42+ for example, while we guarantee support for 1.39+ (effectively breaking our version guarantee, but there's no good way for us to change that).\r\n\r\n> As for why do I like debs?

Installing a package from source and updating/removing it is simply more messy than using a package that integrates with the package manager. After all that's what package managers are for.
