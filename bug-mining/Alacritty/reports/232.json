Ubuntu 18.04\r\nIf on linux, are you using X11 or Wayland? X11\r\n\r\nI will often clear my terminal screen just so I can start issuing commands with a fully empty page. I like however to maintain the full screen history just the same. gnome-terminal reacts to Ctrl-L by actually adding empty lines in the scrollback. alacritty will remove the lines cleared from the screen from the scrollback. Apparently both are valid behaviors:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/268#issuecomment-355764257\r\n\r\nIdeally I'd like a third behavior where just the position in the buffer changes and Ctrl-L is just like a scroll down past the current point so the rest of the terminal below the current position is still empty.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2199/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
