I'm 100% in favor of merging the macos/linux/windows configuration files together, that will actually save us a lot of work in the long run.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's necessary to provide different files for that though, things like default fonts could be handled by making the value optional for example and then substituting it in the code at runtime when it is not present in the config. That allows specifying default system values at compile-time.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/436295909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1949276429,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTk0OTI3NjQyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1949276429","actor":{"login":"nixpulvis","id":715947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTk0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/715947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis","html_url":"https://github.com/nixpulvis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-06T15:35:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1949276433,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE5NDkyNzY0MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1949276433","actor":{"login":"nixpulvis","id":715947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTk0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/715947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis","html_url":"https://github.com/nixpulvis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-06T15:35:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/436313620","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/779#issuecomment-436313620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/779","id":436313620,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjMxMzYyMA==","user":{"login":"nixpulvis","id":715947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTk0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/715947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis","html_url":"https://github.com/nixpulvis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-06T16
