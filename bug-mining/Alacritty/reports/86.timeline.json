the cell side of a selection with the mouse outside of the\r\ngrid has been calculated by setting the `Side` to `Right` whenever the\r\n`X` of the mouse is bigger or equal to `window_width - padding_x`.\r\nHowever since the grid doesn't perfectly fit the window in most cases,\r\nthere was an additional few pixels where the `Side` would be `Left`,\r\nresulting in the selection jumping around.\r\n\r\nTo fix this the additional padding due to not perfectly fitting window\r\nsize has been included in the calculation. The `X` position is now\r\nchecked to be bigger or equal to `width - padding_x - extra_padding_x`.\r\n\r\nAn important note is that this will need changing when the grid is\r\ncentered inside the window, so extra padding is split up evenly. Once\r\nthat change is merged the calculation required will be\r\n`width - padding_x - extra_padding_x / 2.`.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #1412.\r\n\r\nI've created this PR separate from the block selection one because\r\nthis is a fix for an already existing bug. This way it will be easier\r\nto merge this PR without having to first get a finished version of\r\n#1398 up and running.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1720409834,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3MjA0MDk4MzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1720409834","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cde1d8d1edb0c8001a28a2a674c46b5a581439db","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/commits/cde1d8d1edb0c8001a28a2a674c46b5a581439db","created_at":"2018-07-06T14:30:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1720415860,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTcyMDQxNTg2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1720415860","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-06T14:33:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
