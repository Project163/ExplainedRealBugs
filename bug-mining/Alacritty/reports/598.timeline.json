Also, it's worth noting that having your `shell.program` set to something without the `login` call also results in a terminal without a registered session, which I suspect many people have. I don't honestly know what the consequences of not being a registered session are, but all my alacritty instances don't show up when I call `who`.\r\n\r\nHope this helps a
