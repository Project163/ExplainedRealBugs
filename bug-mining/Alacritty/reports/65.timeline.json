After extensive debugging, I find that alacritty is inconsistent with xterm, gnome-terminal, and others.\r\n\r\nHere is the test:\r\n```\r\necho -e '\\e[?1000h\\e[?1006h'; showkey -a\r\n```\r\n\r\nClicking and releasing the left button on the top-left of the terminal window in xterm produces (eliding the hex values)\r\n```\r\n^[[<0;1;1M\r\n^[[<0;1;1m\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in alacritty the result is\r\n```\r\n^[[<0;1;1M\r\n^[[<3;1;1m\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at input.rs, I see that the same `button` value is sent to both `normal_mouse_report` and to `sgr_mouse_report`.  But normal mouse reporting encodes the down/up state in the button value, while SGR uses the capital/lowercase `m` suffix for down/up.  So emacs is misinterpreting the mouseup as button 4, which it assumes is a mouse wheel (though from my experiments, xterm and alacritty both send button 64 and 65 for mouse wheels.  Alacritty doesn't send middle and right clicks at all, so it's hard to test those, but xterm sends 1, 2, and 3 for the other three buttons on my mouse, though, so it looks like it's just sending the index rather than a bitset).  Additionally, it seems that other terminals add various bitmasks for modifier keys.  It's difficult to get a consistent picture, because modified clicks on different terminals tend to bring up various menus, and I couldn't find any actual documentation anywhere.  But roughly, I gather the following:\r\n\r\n* left: button = 0\r\n* middle: button = 1\r\n* right: button = 2\r\n* any other button: button = 3\r\n* wheel down: button = 64\r\n* wheel up: button = 65\r\n* shift: button |= 4\r\n* alt: button |= 8\r\n* ctrl: button |= 16\r\n* motion: button |= 32\r\n\r\nNOTE: I use \"natural\" scrolling via xinput, so my up/down scroll wheel might be backwards.\r\n\r\nThis is completely different from the lowest two bits of \"normal mouse mode\", which I gather is\r\n\r\n* left: button = 0\r\n* middle: button = 1\r\n* right: button = 2\r\n* release: button = 3\r\n\r\nAlacritty misses the boat on a lot of the SGR codes.  Specifically\r\n\r\n* as mentioned above, it incorrectly sends button=3 for release\r\n* it does not include any modifiers, either in presses, releases, motion, or wheels\r\n* it does not include the button in motion (though, again, since it doesn't send anything other than button 0, this could be argued as by design)\r\n\r\nFor now I'm patching my local version to just send button=0 instead of 3.  That fixes my immediate problem, but is not a good long-term solution.  I don't have the time at the moment to learn enough rust to do it correctly.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/360646797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shicks","id":143899,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Mzg5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143899?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shicks","html_url":"https://github.com/shicks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shicks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shicks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shicks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shicks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shicks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shicks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shicks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shicks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shicks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/360711600","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/714#issuecomment-360711600","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/714","id":360711600,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDcxMTYwMA==","user":{"login":"Celti","id":4999146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTkxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4999146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celti","html_url":"https://github.com/Celti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Celti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-26T08:09:13Z","updated_at":"2018-01-26T15:37:07Z","body":"I've got an initial fix at [Celti/alacritty](https://github.com/Celti/alacritty) — it reports the middle and right buttons properly, and reports releases properly in both SGR and normal mode. Since SGR mode condenses all other buttons down to a single code, and normal mode has no provision for them at all, I'm simply ignoring them at this time.\r\n\r\nI don't pass modifiers in yet, ~~nor handle buttons in motion yet~~.\r\n\r\nMotion is now handled — incidentally, Alacritty previously lumped \"button-event\" and \"any-event\" motion modes into the same mode (always acting like the former).

expect Ctrl as a mouse modifier key, because xterm mandates that to access its menus; they don't expect Alt because that's the de-facto modifier key used to move and resize windows; and they don't

We *can't* report Shift, as that is the de-facto standard modifier for ignoring application mouse handling (and Alacritty already treats it as such). The vast majority of CLI applications out there don't *expect* Ctrl to be reported, because xterm mandates Ctrl-Click to access its menus.

was an issue with mouse clicks not working inside of htop which\r\nwas caused by incorrect SGR mouse reporting.\r\n\r\nWith normal mouse reporting the button codes 0/1/2 are used to indicate\r\nwhich button has been pressed and button code 3 is used to indicate that\r\nany button was released.\r\n\r\nHowever in SGR mode the button codes are always 0/1/2 even when the\r\nmouse is released (this is instead indicated through m/M at the end).\r\n\r\nAlacritty was sending button code 3 whenever the mouse has been released\r\neven in SGR mode, which is incorrect.\r\nThis has been fixed by only overwriting the button code on release\r\ninside the normal mouse handling and always passing the exact button\r\ncode for mouse handling in general.\r\n\r\nThere were also a few inconsistencies with xterm.\r\nIn xterm before any mouse interaction is allowed, the normal mouse flag\r\nalways has to be set.
