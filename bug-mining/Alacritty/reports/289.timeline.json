`old habits die hard` can be rephrased as unexpected/abnormal/incorrect behavior. every terminal I've personally used right click has never cleared the selection. lets try to not be pedantic.\r\n\r\n- terminator, right click shows a context menu. closing without selecting an option maintains selection.\r\n- urxvt, right click adjusts the selection to the click location. but otherwise selection is maintained.\r\n- termite, right click literally does nothing. selection is maintained.\r\n\r\n@kchibisov - I don't care about the context menu, i'm fine with right click being essential a noop.\r\nproblem is most terminals have trained people that right click doesn't change the selection in a meaningful way. so worst case is I have to move from the mouse to the keyboard after selection to copy/paste.\r\n\r\nwith alacritty a right click causes the entire selection to be deselected, meaning muscle memory causes me to lose the work I just did. so unless the current behavior can be
