fully share @chrisduerr's reluctancy to *fully* implement Kitty's protocol. Implementing and maintaining such a protocol is quite a burden going on, which seems not trivially justifiable (at least without getting deeper in what benefits it brings). Also, I'm not sure about if such a protocol is a product of a small group and how much peer-review has undergone. From a cursory research, I've seen it had problems in the past (as stated in the first words of kovidgoyal/kitty#3248). Also, Kitty has [gone its own path for graphics instead of using libsixel](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28758979). By no means I'm an expert on the subject and I can't judge myself which path is superior, but on the surface, it looks like Kitty prefers a more bold approach to implementing features, but some stability and agreement would be a requirement for fully embracing any protocol, IMO. Again, not advocating for either path, since I'm not an expert, just pointing out.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, as a safe middle ground, I would be in favour of implementing `CSI u`, as it looks like some (more or less common) terminal standard extension and would not prevent future Kitty protocol implementation, as it's already in it (correct me if I'm wrong). It's also a supported solution for widely used software such as [NeoVIM](https://alpha2phi.medium.com/neovim-101-terminal-and-shell-5be83b9f2b88), [Emacs](https://gist.github.com/gnachman/b4fb1e643e7e82a546bc9f86f30360e4) and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Modifier-Keys#extended-keys).\r\n*Disclaimer*: I'm just looking for Super (ie. Win) key to reach my Emacs to be able to use as another modifier.\r\n\r\nSo here it is my +1/2 on the feature request. If it'll help managing issues to @chrisduerr, I will open a separate issue to focus on `CSI u` (or whatever approach he feels best) as it would solve some of the use cases requested, even with filed issues: #1861, #4451, #4938. Even a PR existed in the past: #5358.\r\n(Note: I've also found #3101, but I can't figure out how it fits in the picture).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1407713718/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pataquets","id":1286254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODYyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1286254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pataquets","html_url":"https://github.com/pataquets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pataquets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pataquets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pataquets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pataquets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pataquets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pataquets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pataquets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pataquets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pataquets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8382201911,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAxkop85TT5PnzwAAAAHznkA3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/8382201911","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-29T16:49:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8382201914,"node_id":"SE_lADOAxkop85TT5PnzwAAAAHznkA6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/8382201914","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-29T16:49:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"soanvig","id":7525286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MjUyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7525286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soanvig","html_url":"https://github.com/soanvig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soanvig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soanvig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soanvig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soanvig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soanvig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soanvig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soanvig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soanvig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soanvig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-31T19:38:06Z","updated_at":"2023-01-31T19:38:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/crossterm-rs/crossterm/issues/747","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/crossterm-rs/crossterm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/crossterm-rs/crossterm/issues/747/labels{/name}","comments_url"

The Kitty protocol [page](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol) mentions quite a few terminals/editors/libraries which now support the Kitty protocol. I found one inaccuracy though, NeoVim only has partial support as of now: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14400. Both `vim` & `helix` claim full support. In addition, all the applications which support the Kitty protocol, also support `CSI u`.\r\n2. Alright I'll wait for your PR. Don't expect anything soon from me as I'm a complete terminal internals noob, but I'm handy with
