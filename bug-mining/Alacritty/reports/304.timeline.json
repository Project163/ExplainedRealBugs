someone who has used Alacritty for a while now, and been involved in [various discussions](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues?q=commenter%3Asshock), and even made an important [contribution](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/pull/2239) to fix a [bug](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5876), please hear me out.\r\n\r\nLet me start by saying that I recognize there is no \"right\" or \"wrong\" when it comes to a default color scheme.  Indeed there are many [different defaults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors) that have been used over time.  So of course Alacritty is free to choose whatever scheme and that doesn't make it \"wrong\".\r\n\r\nBut it also doesn't mean that the choice that has been made is the best choice, or even a good choice.\r\n\r\nI would like to give a concrete reason for why the \"Tomorrow Night\" scheme is not a good choice for a default.  And it's not because the [green is yellowish](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1561) or because red and bright red seem backwards to me.\r\n\r\nIt's because the colors are too close and that breaks usability.\r\n\r\nThe problem is several colors are not distinct enough to make them distinguishable, especially the bright vs non-bright of a color.  They are too similar, and that makes some apps unusable due to the text being unreadable.\r\n\r\nHere are Alacritty's default colors:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"335\" alt=\"alacritty 256\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/179561271-22d95e6d-81a1-4ce4-988e-b22351670d1e.png\">\r\n\r\nIn contrast, here is my current color scheme, which I consider to be more sane:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"356\" alt=\"good 256\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/179561327-a0ff784d-e1b7-432f-abd9-2cd15ce6e0c3.png\">\r\n\r\nIt may not be readily apparent what is the big problem.  After all, Alacritty's colors do look pretty smooth and nice.  And the color scheme I am using is positively garish.\r\n\r\nHopefully the next picture with every color on top of every color will help illustrate the problem:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"735\" alt=\"alacritty 16\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/179563316-cf6a0b5f-7bf2-419f-b937-6c35a191daf8.png\">\r\n\r\nAnd here is the color scheme I am using for comparison:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"738\" alt=\"good 16\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/179563358-5cf513a8-4d08-4f88-b7da-2d5d0c196dfd.png\">\r\n\r\nMaybe the problem still isn't apparent, but let's take a look at some specific spots, starting with green on green:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"92\" alt=\"green1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/179564349-eb32eeb7-c415-4b2c-8321-1d82cea37080.png\">\r\n\r\nIgnore the top-left and bottom-right.  Those of course will be impossible to read because it is literally the exact same color.  But the bottom-left and top-right are bright-green on green and green on bright-green.  As you can see above, it is a bit washed out and somewhat hard to read.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, this text is easy to read:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"90\" alt=\"green2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/179564631-a83b0610-9401-4cc2-b87a-b76eadbac10e.png\">\r\n\r\nNow for yellow and blue:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"90\" alt=\"yellow1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/179564698-0383d45f-ed74-44b3-b3c2-585dd24c193e.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"87\" alt=\"blue1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/179564853-3da928f0-7472-42ed-803f-5722c79fc2b5.png\">\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the text above is very difficult to read.\r\n\r\nIn contrast:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"89\" alt=\"yellow2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/179564970-c1cbf1b3-aa55-4a13-a049-21d5871ffd6e.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"87\" alt=\"blue2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/179564979-8809de7e-6c23-4d50-b8f4-9e6c494fd868.png\">\r\n\r\nLast but not least, cyan on bright cyan (and vice-versa):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"92\" alt=\"cyan1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/179565179-d5d4b301-a8be-47b0-b0ad-3d3e1e3cc282.png\">\r\n\r\nIt's almost impossible to read.  You literally have to sit 3 inches away from your monitor and strain your eyes to read it.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, this is quite easy to read:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"87\" alt=\"cyan2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/179565351-959f626d-9071-49a5-8e48-7f5555e20feb.png\">\r\n\r\nWhen I first started using alacritty, the colors really threw me off.  I can't remember if I was just using vim or what, but I do remember being really confused and being unable to read the text in some places.  I didn't immediately realize it was due to Alacritty's default color scheme.  It took me a little while to realize that and then took more time to change it.\r\n\r\nIt is true that what colors look nice to someone is subjective.  But what colors are readable on top of each other is not.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the goal of a default color scheme should not be to be \"nice-looking\" or \"fancy\" or \"aesthetic\" or \"pastel\".  Those things are fine, but not at the expense of readability, which is way more important because unreadable == unusable.\r\n\r\nI will admit it was fun learning that the colors are configurable and having fun trying out different schemes.  But I arrived there out of necessity rather than by choice.\r\n\r\nIt is awesome that everyone can change the defaults, and I think everyone should, but which of these scenarios is better?\r\n\r\nScenario 1: \"How come the text is unreadable?  Hmm...  (2 hours later)...  Oh, it's because of Alacritty's default colors; alright, well luckily this is configurable; let's see, how to change colors here .... (2 hours later) ...; ok, now I can finally read the text in my app here\".\r\n\r\nScenario 2: \"I've noticed the alacritty default colors are so plain and dumb, but it's configurable, yay!  I'm going to jazz it up now and switch to a really cool color scheme!\"\r\n\r\nI would like to argue that scenario 2 is better.  That having sane defaults, even if uglier, is better.  That having readable text is more important than having a cool / smooth / pastel color scheme.\r\n\r\nThe \"tomorrow night\" scheme only works if some colors are never used together.  The basic scheme I am using works with all color combinations.\r\n\r\nShould Alacritty switch to the ugly scheme I am using?  Not necessarily.  I bet there are other good color schemes that are usable without being as plain and garish.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6213/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6213/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7646832053,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAxkop84iMMVszwAAAAHHyWW1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/7646832053","actor":{"login":"sshock","id":1693761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTM3NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1693761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock","html_url":"https://github.com/sshock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"22be8179cdbee62a482c75679c9c46275d40c9d7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sshock/alacritty/commits/22be8179cdbee62a482c75679c9c46275d40c9d7","created_at":"2022-10-22T19:10:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sshock","id":1693761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTM3NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1693761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock","html_url":"https://github.com/sshock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-22T19:54:41Z","updated_at":"2022-10-22T19:54:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6438","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6438/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6438/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6438/events","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/6438","id":1419480290,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAxkop85BWH9I","number":6438,"title":"Change

the bright colors to the normal colors (\"Tomorrow Night\") multiplied by a brightness factor of 1.34 (capped at 100%).\r\n\r\nThis follows the proposed approach given in the [original issue](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3404) from Mar 2020 to rework the default bright colors.\r\n\r\nMore precisely, take each normal color, convert RGB to HSV, then multiply the V by 1.34, and finally convert back to RGB.\r\n\r\nThere are just two minor deviations:\r\n1. The normal yellow already has a brightness of 94.1%, so changing the brightness to 100% doesn't result in a big enough difference; so for bright yellow the saturation was also changed, from 51.7 to 40, which gives it a noticeable difference.\r\n2. For bright black the brightness was just changed from 12.9% to 40%; 40% is exactly the same brightness level we are currently using; the formula just doesn't work to go from black to bright black because multiplying black brightness by 1.34 doesn't really change it much.\r\n\r\nThe new color scheme has all of the following advantages:\r\n* Bright colors are now easily distinguishable from their normal counterparts.\r\n* Bright red is now brighter than normal red instead of darker.\r\n* Bright cyan is now brighter than normal cyan instead of being almost identical and actually slightly darker.\r\n* Overall contrast is greatly improved across the board (see bar chart below).\r\n\r\nLuminance calculations (using formula `0.2126*R + 0.7152*G + 0.0722*B`) for Red and Cyan:\r\n* **Red BEFORE:**\r\n  * Normal = 0.23299420863212106\r\n  * Bright = 0.20219445780928133\r\n* **Red AFTER:**\r\n  * Normal = 0.23299420863212106\r\n  * Bright = 0.3825685577896843\r\n* **Cyan BEFORE:**\r\n  * Normal = 0.4564908235539082\r\n  * Bright = 0.4431834311169868\r\n* **Cyan AFTER:**\r\n  * Normal = 0.4564908235539082\r\n  * Bright = 0.8842685999154053\r\n\r\nHere is a visual comparison of the current (old) colorscheme versus the new one with this PR.  The screenshots show all color combinations:\r\n\r\n**OLD**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1455\" alt=\"old\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/197359669-d76aead8-33f9-48aa-b6dd-cb4ef97bfc3b.png\">\r\n\r\n**NEW**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1454\" alt=\"new\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/197359671-63415e9b-e53c-40a9-8483-7d9d7da9c605.png\">\r\n\r\nFinally, here is a bar chart showing the contrast delta (X axis has a point for each color combination; Y axis shows the new contrast minus the old contrast):\r\n\r\n![contrast_delta](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1693761/197359736-b0bbfdb6-e117-44ec-9678-3cec09898ab6.png)\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6213 for more details.\r\n\r\nSome history:\r\n\r\nThe original issue was \"solved\" by incorporating the 8 colors from \"Tomorrow Night Bright\" as the bright colors, but there was no logical reason for doing that as that color scheme is just another nice 8-color scheme and has no correlation to \"Tomorrow Night\" other than having a similar name.  Any other random color scheme could have been chose for the bright colors and would have resulted in the same problem.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the original issue was only partially solved as many bright colors remained hard to distinguish from their normal counterpart, since both the hue and brightness remained very close (and yes it makes sense for normal and bright to have the same hue, but not the same brightness).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6438/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7669003442,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAxkop84iMMVszwAAAAHJG7Sy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/7669003442","actor":{"login":"sshock","id":1693761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTM3NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1693761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock","html_url":"https://github.com/sshock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sshock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3f57a43387b787c555751772b244944639017d86","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sshock/alacritty/commits/3f57a43387b787c555751772b244944639017d86","created_at":"2022-10-26T03:54:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12633766392,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAxkop84iMMVszwAAAALxB_n4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/12633766392","actor":{"login":"boxofrox","id":636691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjY5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/636691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox","html_url":"https://github.com/boxofrox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9a0eac0a14e631485c9e33e7499d84549ba510fc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/boxofrox/alacritty/commits/9a0eac0a14e631485c9e33e7499d84549ba510fc","created_at":"2024-04-28T04:43:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
