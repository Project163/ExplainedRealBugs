Supporting unicode is hard, and it might be a good idea to use a library that knows how to do it well. Maybe look into using [harfbuzz](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz/) as well as freetype for font rendering. [Unicode-width](http://unicode-rs.github.io/unicode-width/unicode_width/index.html) is good but doesn't do everything.\r\n\r\nThe problem of translating sequences of unicode codepoints to actual you-can-draw-this-on-screen glyphs, supporting things like character width (https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/265), ligatures (https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/50), bidirectional text (like in arabic), and text reordering (!), is called [complex text layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_text_layout). It is, appropriately, complex, and most terminals don't actually do it very well.\r\n\r\nWindows and Mac both have systems that perform layout, integrated with their font rasterizers:\r\n- On windows, there's several different supported libraries, from various periods of windows history: DirectWrite, GDI, and Uniscribe on windows.\r\n- On OS X, there's Core Text.\r\n- On linux, there's a stack: freetype for rasterizing, [harfbuzz](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz/) for \"text shaping\", and [pango](http://www.pango.org/) for full layout. All of these libraries are actually cross-platform, though. See [this article](http://mces.blogspot.in/2009/11/pango-vs-harfbuzz.html) for more on the difference between pango and harfbuzz.\r\n\r\nThere's also [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/), which is cross-platform and supported by IBM (I think?)\r\n\r\nOf the available options:\r\n- OS X Terminal / Iterm2 use Core Text\r\n- Terminator (and everything else that uses GTK) uses Pango\r\n- Windows CMD and Powershell use black magic and baby tears\r\n- Chrome uses harfbuzz\r\n- Firefox uses pango\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nIt seems to me like harfbuzz is the best option in terms of cross-platform support and level of control. You basically hand it a line of text and it tells you all the glyphs to draw in that line. Keep in mind I'm not actually a font rendering person, though, and it's possible I'm missing important details here.\r\n\r\nThis would probably have a performance cost, but I'm not sure how *much* of a performance cost. With a clever implementation it might not be too bad, and would be a huge boon to international users.\r\n\r\nOther relevant links:\r\n- [Iterm2 discussing ligature support](https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/3568)\r\n- [Chromium discussing a switch to harfbuzz](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=286450)\r\n- Terminals that support
