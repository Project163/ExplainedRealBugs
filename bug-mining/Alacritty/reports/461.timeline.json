Note, plain undercurls require `set -as terminal-overrides ',*:Smulx=\\E[4::%p1%dm'` in `tmux.conf` and coloured underlines & undercurls also require `set -as terminal-overrides ',*:Setulc=\\E[58::2::%p1%{65536}%/%d::%p1%{256}%/%{255}%&%d::%p1%{255}%&%d%;m'`.\r\n\r\n- [mintty](https://github.com/mintty/mintty) it appears also supports coloured undercurls which they note in their [text attributes and rendering](https://github.com/mintty/mintty/wiki/Tips#text-attributes-and-rendering) documentation; [this discussion](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/226#issuecomment-381665023) may also be of interest.\r\n\r\n- Lastly, iTerm2 is currently working on undercurls and coloured undercurls. Not released yet, and only non-coloured undercurls are working in the beta-release as noted in their issue [#6382](https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/-/issues/6382). As noted in that issue, the terminfos provided on Mac are not as up-to-date as on Linux, so users on Mac likely need to fiddle terminfo databases.\r\n\r\nIs it worth the effort?\r\n\r\nYes, I believe so. I would not classify this as urgent (it isn't). But it sure would be nice to have. Alacritty has already implemented a first very important step, that being to render underlines itself. The next logical steps, once time and man-power permits, is to extend that to undercurls and then coloured underlines & undercurls.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of coloured undercurls running in GNOME Terminal + tmux + Neovim doing spell check highlighting via undercurls:\r\n\r\n![undercurl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11382509/88470712-33f9f880-cf43-11ea-9bc8-553ccd446614.png)\r\n\r\nBest
