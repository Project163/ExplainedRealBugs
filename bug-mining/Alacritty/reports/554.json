been using `alacritty msg create-window` to manage multiple terminals at once, which works great.\r\nHowever, it does not support configuration flags, such as `-o=...` or `--config-file ...`.\r\n\r\nI would imagine this could be due to technical reasons, as settings like `ipc_socket` or `debug.*` only make sense from an instance, rather than an individual window.\r\n\r\nI request that window-specific configuration is implemented in a way that overrides the instance configuration, using the same flags as currently exposed on the main executable.\r\n\r\nIf an instance-specific configuration flag such as `ipc_socket` or `debug.*` is set to a mismatching value, either on the command line or in a file, when it doesn't make sense to override, alacritty could throw an error.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that configuration would need to be refactored for this change to be implemented, because it's probably not structured per-window at this time, so I don't expect it to be easy to implement.\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Arch Linux\r\nVersion: `alacritty 0.10.1`\r\nLinux: Wayland, Sway\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ alacritty msg create-window
