Conpty,

I can create a binding for \"Alt-j\", but not \"Alt-J\", but \"Alt-X\" works fine 😕.\r\n\r\nHere is a config snippet that adds the 2 missing bindings I found and enables a couple alt keys to test -

Summary\r\nConfiguration option `alt_send_esc` does not have any affect in Windows and the default behavior is that no Alt key-chords work.\r\n\r\nSomewhat related, `ctrl+space` should be `^@` and `ctrl+\\` should be `\\x1c` but they are not mapped.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is seen for both ConPTY and WinPTY backends.\r\n\r\n### How the issue was verified\r\n\r\nUse a minimal `alacritty.yml`:\r\n```\r\nenable_experimental_conpty_backend: true\r\nalt_send_esc: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse `showkey -a` to see the result of the following key-chords:\r\n- `alt+p`\r\n- `alt+2`\r\n- `alt+]`\r\n- `alt-ctrl-f`\r\n- `ctrl+space`\r\n- `ctrl+\\`\r\n- `ctrl+b`\r\n- `ctrl+d`\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n```\r\ncmd> wsl.exe -e showkey -a\r\n\r\nPress any keys - Ctrl-D will terminate this program\r\n\r\n         32 0040 0x20\r\n^\\       28 0034 0x1c\r\n^B        2 0002 0x02\r\n^D        4 0004 0x04\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith every other terminal emulator I tested, including the default for cmd.exe, I see the expected result:\r\n```\r\ncmd> wsl.exe -e showkey -a\r\n\r\nPress any keys - Ctrl-D will terminate this program\r\n\r\n^[p      27 0033 0x1b\r\n        112 0160 0x70\r\n^[2      27

affect.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23530447/69000550-14c8a880-0897-11ea-8339-e8cc05c7c7ab.png)\r\n\r\nToggling `enable_experimental_conpty_backend` between true and false (WinPTY and ConPTY) has no affect. Proof both were tested:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23530447/69000879-83a80080-089b-11ea-8aaf-6eacbc0aa03d.png)\r\n\r\n**Which operating system does the issue occur on?**\r\nWindows 10 Pro version 1909\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere seem to be several open and closed issues that mention this problem, but none of them are specifically addressing why `alt_send_esc` has no affect and a few control sequence mappings are missing in Windows

I just want to verify first that normal keys result in a `ReceivedCharacter` event, but when holding `alt` there is none.\r\nIf `alt` is a member of any key-chord nothing prints that matches the pattern `ReceivedCharacter`. Other key-chords do print. \r\n\r\n@chrisduerr, here is an example of the following sequence:\r\n1. `b`\r\n2. `ctrl+b`\r\n3. `alt+b`\r\n4. `alt+ctrl+b`\r\n5. `ctrl+d`\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nalacritty.exe --print-events 2>&1 | grep \"ReceivedCharacter\"\r\n[2019-11-16 18:35] [INFO] glutin event: WindowEvent { window_id: WindowId(WindowId(0xb01de)), event: ReceivedCharacter('b') }\r\n[2019-11-16 18:35]

WindowId(WindowId(0xb01de)), event: ReceivedCharacter('\\u{4}') }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the two missing events between `\\u{2}` and `\\u{4}`.\r\n\r\nNothing prints matching that pattern if the `Alt` key is held. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf I define a keybinding:\r\n```yaml\r\nkey_bindings:\r\n  - { key: B, mods: Alt, chars: \"\\x1bb\"  }\r\n  - { key: B, mods: Alt|Control, chars: \"\\x1b\\x02\" }\r\n```\r\nAnd repeat the same sequence above, I can see `^[b` and `^[^B` prints in `showkey -a` but I get the same result from the `RecievedCharacter` pattern match as before, nothing prints when `Alt` is held.\r\n\r\nI tried this in both WinPTY and ConPTY with the same result as well as with `alt_send_esc` true and
