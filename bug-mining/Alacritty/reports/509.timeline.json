I have this issue of bottom gap when i run alacritty in monocle mode in dwm, which automatically resizes it to maximized, but it doesn't appear on tiling mode, when it is resized to be slightly smaller, i have read #1816 which seems to be my problem, went further reading #1780 and #388, tried setting dynamic_window to true but still doesn't fix it, instead gaps are added at all sides which makes it even worse\r\nHow can i solve this issue?
