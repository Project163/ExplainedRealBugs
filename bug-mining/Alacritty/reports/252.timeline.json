bug reports, the following information can help speed up the process. Please describe the bug that you have found and what you would expect to happen instead.\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Linux\r\nVersion: alacritty 0.4.0\r\nLinux/BSD: Wayland, Gnome\r\n\r\n/!\\ In `alacritty.yml`, `startup_mode` is set to `Maximized`. The option works perfectly well under KDE/Plasma with X11 or Gnome & X11 for example, but might lead to the following bug.\r\n\r\nOn Gnome/Wayland, when opening Alacritty, the window gets the correct available size (ie. the size of the screen, less the height of the Gnome-shell bar on the top taken off), but get *positioned* from pixel 0,0 on top left. The result is that the title-bar is not visible and there is an unused space that have top bar's height unused on the bottom. User doesn't have access to the title bar either.\r\n\r\nSee the first joined screenshot:\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-01-04 11-40-17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709500/71764423-033f6c80-2ee8-11ea-9917-3774734e9a67.png)\r\n\r\nAnother maybe related curious point: title-bar is visible when using the expose feature, but is kinda \"eaten up\" on the border, see this screenshot:\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-01-04
