In your alacritty_macos.yml, add a new `key_bindings` like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkey_bindings:\r\n  - { key: N,        mods: Command, command: { program: \"open\", args: [\"-n\", \"/Applications/Alacritty.app\"] } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, pressing Command + N will open a new window. It works how you'd expect, except that Command + Q will only kill one window (since each window is run as a separate desktop application).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/329083060/reactions","total_count":69,"+1":57,"-1":2,"laugh":0,"hooray":7,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brycefisher","id":220106,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDEwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/220106?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycefisher","html_url":"https://github.com/brycefisher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycefisher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycefisher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycefisher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycefisher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycefisher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycefisher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycefisher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycefisher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycefisher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1246679480,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTI0NjY3OTQ4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1246679480","actor":{"login":"OJFord","id":3946014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDYwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3946014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord","html_url":"https://github.com/OJFord","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-13T07:28:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1246679481,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEyNDY2Nzk0ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1246679481","actor":{"login":"OJFord","id":3946014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDYwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3946014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord","html_url":"https://github.com/OJFord","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OJFord/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-13T07:28:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"SevereOverfl0w","id":6136282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzYyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6136282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SevereOverfl0w","html_url":"https://github.com/SevereOverfl0w","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SevereOverfl0w/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SevereOverfl0w/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SevereOverfl0w/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SevereOverfl0w/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SevereOverfl0w/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SevereOverfl0w/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SevereOverfl0w/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SevereOverfl0w/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SevereOverfl0w/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-03T14:34:15Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T14:34:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/808","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/808/labels
