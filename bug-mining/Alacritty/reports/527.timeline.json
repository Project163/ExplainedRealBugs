It also fixes long\r\nstanding issues with the virtual key code bindings and make bindings in\r\ngeneral more predictable. It also makes our default Vi key bindings\r\nfully working.\r\n\r\nGiven that alacritty was using `VirtualKey` directly in the bindings\r\nfrom the winit, and winit simply removed the enum, we've added internal\r\nconversions to minimize the fallout, but new way to specify the bindings\r\nshould be more intuitive.\r\n\r\nOther part of this update fixes some forward compatibility bugs with the\r\nWayland backend, given that wayland-rs 0.30 is fully forward compatible.\r\nThe update also fixes weird Maximized startup issues on GNOME Wayland,\r\nhowever they were present on any sane
