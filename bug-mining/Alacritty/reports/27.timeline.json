sent. I think `translate_key_event` should still be called in this case, but is should just not attempt to run `Xutf8LookupString`. I've pushed [a patch]( https://github.com/jwilm/glutin/commit/cc64178d39a1fa06b2c5403117e5e0ef24deeac4) to my glutin fork which implements this. Would you mind checking that dead keys are still only printed once?\r\n\r\nIncidentally, this doesn't actually fix the bug where the shell exiting doesn't immediately close Alacritty. The bug is worked around by receiving a KeyRelease event. In any case, I think this implementation might be more correct for glutin/winit.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/280828066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":967921315,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTY3OTIxMzE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/967921315","actor":{"login":"michelboaventura","id":111037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTAzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura","html_url":"https://github.com/michelboaventura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-18T07:19:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":967921316,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDk2NzkyMTMxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/967921316","actor":{"login":"michelboaventura","id":111037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTAzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura","html_url":"https://github.com/michelboaventura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-18T07:19:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/280843381","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/422#issuecomment-280843381","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/422","id":280843381,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDg0MzM4MQ==","user":{"login":"michelboaventura","id":111037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTAzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura","html_url":"https://github.com/michelboaventura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/ev
