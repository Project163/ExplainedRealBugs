The biggest drawback to the centered view (other than possible preference) is how it looks when it's being zoomed. Whereas before text would grow from the top-left somewhat uniformly, now the text jumps around a lot more. This will probably be enough for me to turn the centering off. The same kind of visual jumping was the cause of this issue while resizing a window.\r\n\r\nTo both fix the window resize (tiling WM movement) issue, and partially fix the zooming issue the option to only center the X axis could be added.
