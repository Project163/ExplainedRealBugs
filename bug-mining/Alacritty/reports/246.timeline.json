The modulo operation made it impossible for that miscalculation to hit `self.zero`, but the new `wrap_index` function isn't so lucky. I'm working on figuring out the cause, because it seems to me to predate #3060, with modulo masking an earlier miscalculation.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/565118646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sterlingjensen","id":5555776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTU3NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5555776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen","html_url":"https://github.com/sterlingjensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/565119247","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3088#issuecomment-565119247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3088","id":565119247,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTExOTI0Nw==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-12T18:06:36Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T18:06:36Z","body":"This was not an off by one error...\r\n\r\nAnd it doesn't predate #3060 either.

The only difference being the modulo just prior to assignment.\r\nMy point being: that sum can't function as an index or a length (unless modified further up the chain). The closest you can get within the `wrap_index` function involves breaking the first ge comparison up to handle gt and eq on different match arms - but it couldn't pass 2 of the ref tests without changes that would defeat its purpose.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/565264196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sterlingjensen","id":5555776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTU3NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5555776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen","html_url":"https://github.com/sterlingjensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/565266310","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3088#issuecomment-565266310","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3088","id":565266310,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NTI2NjMxMA==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-13T01:52:04Z","updated_at":"2019-12-13T01:54:48Z","body":"I'm not really sure what your point is. I don't see why it wouldn't work, since it has been working just fine for years.\r\n\r\nThis bug was just a minor oversight due to exceeding the 2 * inner.len() limit for the wrap_index function, but that is completely unrelated to the way this indexes the ringbuffer in general.\r\n\r\nI should also note that the size is only coincidentally bigger by just a single number in your example. It can far exceed that and get up to `(self.inner.len() * 3) - 1`.

That isn't a value judgement, lots of tradeoffs are needed for a performant scrollback implementation - complexity being one such trade. I am curious about the interaction of those variables in relation to `self.zero` though, I don't think I'll find satisfaction until I run them through an SMT solver - but that is a personal problem :no_mouth:\r\nI did spend some time in the debugger though, and found some pathological cases that would likely require more than three branches (gt, lt, eq) to fully cover. At least two of those branches require an additional guard, without which you get either an overflow or an off by one (seriously, two more happen whichever method you try). So performance would suffer. I doubt recursion would improve performance over the modulo, but it would work.\r\nI guess my point is that without some modification to those input variables, I don't believe that you can outperform the existing solution. Not that I'm wishing failure on such an endeavor. Actually... did you considered a function signature that breaks those summed variables up? `const fn` grows by the day :grin:","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/565293775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sterlingjensen","id":5555776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTU3NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5555776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen","html_url":"https://github.com/sterlingjensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterlingjensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3249249131,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMyNDkyNDkxMzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3249249131","actor":{"login":"roychoo","id":1853311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTMzMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo","html_url":"https://github.com/roychoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0176dba03219557af1f31b822cbd9597dadb200b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roychoo/alacritty/commits/0176dba03219557af1f31b822cbd9597dadb200b","created_at":"2020-04-19T16:47:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
