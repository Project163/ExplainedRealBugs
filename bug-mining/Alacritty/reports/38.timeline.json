I dug into this one a little more today, and admittedly, the problem seems to have mostly been my misunderstanding of how ANSI colors work in terminals (although it's not exactly intuitive).\r\n\r\nSome [canonical references refer to ANSI color codes](http://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting) this way:\r\n\r\n* Code 37 as \"light gray\"\r\n* Code 90 as \"dark gray\"\r\n* Code 91 through 96 as \"light\" colors\r\n* Code 97 as white\r\n\r\nAlacritty uses a more traditional approach which I think derives from [an old standard called \"aixterm\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors) (but I'm not sure; more reading required here):\r\n\r\n* Code 37 is white\r\n* Codes 90 through 97 are \"bright\" colors\r\n    * Code 90 is \"bright black\".\r\n    * Code 97 is \"bright white\"\r\n\r\nI'm not sure where the light versus bright conflation comes from, but these seem to be treated as roughly the same thing, and it probably doesn't matter which adjective you use as long as they're different from the normal color set.\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting is that even terminals that are using the same nomenclature as Alacritty tend to be informally respecting the first system when it comes to the light gray/dark gray/white/black; maybe because the concepts of \"bright black\" and \"bright white\" are nonsense. iTerm2's color palette does a good job of demonstrating this:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"176\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-04-30 at 11 17 01 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/96890/25566973/b4ca5982-2d98-11e7-8b6f-dd465df0c3e3.png\">\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the screenshot:\r\n\r\n* Normal black = black.\r\n* Bright black = dark gray.\r\n* Normal white = light gray.\r\n* Bright white = white.\r\n\r\n@jwilm Would you be open to trying a similar scheme by modifying Alacritty's default color scheme? From what I gather, it seems to be expected at least informally in places, and seems to make UIs that use grays more readable.\r\n\r\nHere's what my proposed patch would be:\r\n\r\n``` patch\r\ndiff

two colors might be an adequate fix in itself.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/298250370/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brandur","id":96890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2ODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur","html_url":"https://github.com/brandur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1063511680,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTA2MzUxMTY4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1063511680","actor":{"login":"brandur","id":96890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2ODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur","html_url":"https://github.com/brandur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-04-30T19:04:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1063511681,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEwNjM1MTE2ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1063511681","actor":{"login":"brandur","id":96890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2ODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur","html_url":"https://github.com/brandur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-04-30T19:04:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/298251787","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/503#issuecomment-298251787","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/503","id":298251787,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODI1MTc4Nw==","user":{"login":"boxofrox","id":636691,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNjY5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/636691?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox","html_url":"https://github.com/boxofrox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boxofrox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-30T19:31:41Z","updated_at":"2017-04-30T19:35:58Z","body":"Swapping
