This of course affects everyone, colored underline or not.\r\n\r\nI don't think that should necessarily stop us from implementing it, but it would be nice to try and reduce the cell size first before implementing it. That is the main reason it isn't implemented yet. So we should try to free up some space and then it should be a simple choice to use some of that freed up space to store this additional information. The best place for that would likely be the zerowidth character storage.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/675380306/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3665529036,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM2NjU1MjkwMzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3665529036","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-18T09:49:25Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/682318799","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4142#issuecomment-682318799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4142","id":682318799,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MjMxODc5OQ==","user":{"login":"bluz71","id":11382509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzgyNTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11382509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71","html_url":"https://github.com/bluz71","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-28T04:32:06Z","updated_at":"2020-08-28T04:32:06Z","body":"The recent commit [b904207b1979bb] added support for double underline whilst also doing this:\r\n\r\n> Alacritty will now also always fallback to the normal underline in case\r\nany of the other underlines like the undercurl are specified.\r\n\r\nA very nice enhancement towards the goal of colored undercurls as noted in this [undercurl feature request](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1628).\r\n\r\nA pathway as outlined by @chrisduerr seems to be:\r\n\r\n- First reduce cell size\r\n\r\n- Second use the freed up space, say in zerowidth character storage, to store color underline details separate from the character they sit beneath.\r\n\r\nFolks like myself who want colored undercurls would instead get colored underline which are almost as good.
