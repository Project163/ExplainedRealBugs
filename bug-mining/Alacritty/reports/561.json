That can be done through the use of [`PushKeyboardEnhancementFlags`](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/event/struct.PushKeyboardEnhancementFlags.html), whereupon my program will receive [`Release`](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/event/enum.KeyEventKind.html#variant.Release) and [`Repeat`](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/event/enum.KeyEventKind.html#variant.Repeat) events in addition to just [`Press`](https://docs.rs/crossterm/latest/crossterm/event/enum.KeyEventKind.html#variant.Press). However, it seems like that functionality is dependent on the terminal implementing the [kitty keyboard protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/), which alacritty doesn't.\r\n\r\nAre there any plans for implementing such a feature, or is there a better way to achieve the same goal (arbitrary keys as modifiers) in alacritty?","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6378/reactions","total_count":28,"+1":16,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":7},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6378/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
