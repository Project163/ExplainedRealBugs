An undandled OSC/CSI/ESC event doesn't actually necessarily mean that there's any error at all. It just means that a program is sending an escape sequence which isn't supported by Alacritty yet.\r\n\r\nThese messages are mainly there for debugging and I've set both CSI and ESC to the `debug!` level in my PR. But it looks like I've forgot about the OSC escapes.\r\n\r\nUnless there's something that doesn't work, it should be fine to ignore
