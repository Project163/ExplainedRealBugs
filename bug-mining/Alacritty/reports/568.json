Using `xsettingsd` and my [handy DPI script](https://gist.github.com/frebib/0703227f47358e867e09f02c872425ff/raw) for adjusting X11 DPI on the fly, I can get on just fine. Many (GTK-based) applications, including other vte based terminal emulators, implement the xsettings protocol and change their DPI when asked to.\r\n\r\nI can't seem to work out how to get Alacritty to change the scale/dpi without restarting each terminal instance. I'd like to be able to replicate the same \"change dpi at will\" functionality as I can with most other windows.","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2886/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2886/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
