 what it is worth, on Linux, you can install `wmctrl` which allows you to control windows from the terminal. In my .zshrc, I have an alias: `alias wq='wmctrl -r 'Alacritty' -b toggle,fullscreen'` which allows you to toggle fullscreen with the command `wq`. If you use tmux, you can bind this command to F11 by putting the following into your `.tmux.conf`:\r\n\r\n`bind -n F11 run-shell 'wmctrl -r 'Alacritty' -b toggle,fullscreen'`\r\n\r\nNotice that this works because 'Alacritty' is the title of the window. So, if your tmux config changes the title, you have to be aware of this and adjust either the new title or the key-binding/alias to match.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have found trying to invoke an alias with a tmux key-binding does not work, so just type in the entire command it references instead.\r\n\r\n`wmctrl` is pretty legit. Type in `wmctrl  -l` to get a listing of all your windows to see what to target with it. You may be able to hit Alacritty in other ways besides with the window title. I don't know what the OS X equivalent it, but if we are preserving the 'purity' of Alacritty by farming out scrollback to tmux, we might consider trying to use wmctrl for as much functionality as we can.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on binding shell commands to the keys in the Alacritty config? Can you do that with other terminal emulators?\r\n\r\nI really witsh we could change the font size without restarting Alacritty. Maybe we could think of giving the `alacritty` command some functionality the way the `tmux` command can be used within tmux to detach sessions, split panes etc. I like the 'the best UI is no UI' approach. We should remain very opposed to cluttering the UI.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/352630720/reactions","total_count":16,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"qtleeq","id":2774135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzQxMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2774135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtleeq","html_url":"https://github.com/qtleeq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtleeq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtleeq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtleeq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtleeq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtleeq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtleeq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtleeq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtleeq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/qtleeq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/353676478","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/34#issuecomment-353676478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/34","id":353676478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzY3NjQ3OA==","user":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-22T21:21:25Z","updated_at":"2017-12-22T21:21:25Z","body":"@TaylorDennisLee font resizing is available on latest master.
