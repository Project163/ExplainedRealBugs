Architecture\n\nx86-64\n\n### Other Software\n\nhyprland 0.32.0\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\neither set the wm_class via `profiles.<profilename>. wm_class` or pass it via `contour class`\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`hyprctl clients` should display the new class\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nNothing changes, although the result is slightly different on the old/stable and the version obtained from github actions. In the former case class is set to `contour`; on the git version it is simply goes blank if specified via an argument, and doesn't change when specified in the configuration.\n\n### Additional notes\n\nRegarding the versions, the oldest one was obtained from nixpkgs (built from source), the newer versions were \"repackaged\" from .debs for ubuntu 22.04 (obtained from releases and github actions' artifacts).
