This does feel like something alacritty _could_ choose to do if it wanted: if the kitty keyboard protocol is enabled, then send events for these types of keys, and if it's not enabled, then do not. That feels like what `rio` is doing.\r\n\r\nI certainly don't know what the \"right\" behavior should be here. I personally would prefer for things to behave like `rio` (again, happy to explain why, but the thing I'm trying to do is so me-specific, I don't think you'd find it to be a particularly useful data point). IIUC, since this is about the terminal emulator's behavior when the kitty keyboard protocol is *not* active then [the specification](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/) does not apply?, perhaps it's just up to the terminal emulator to decide what should happen here (or perhaps there's some other specification that applies
