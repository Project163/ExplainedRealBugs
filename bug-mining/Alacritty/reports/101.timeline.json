guys. I'm attempting to implement a working windows build in my spare time. I'm a Rust n00b, so excuse the roughness...\r\nhttps://github.com/rayman22201/alacritty/commit/dab775a9feddffcf61cb817f5a0bd72643826d73\r\n\r\nUsing the links @rigtorp posted, and a bit of digging, I _think_ that I have font rendering working for windows. (A very rough pass of something that I think might work if I'm lucky... The module compiles at least)\r\nBut I have other problems that prevent me from testing it:\r\n\r\nYou seem to be pegged to a particular commit of @jwilm's fork of Glutin. This fork does not compile on windows. the Glutin Windows implementation does not implement the clear_current function of the glContext trait. (A function that doesn't even exist in later commits, btw)\r\n\r\nWhy are you pegged to an old commit of your Glutin fork @jwilm ?\r\n\r\nBumping up to the latest commit of the Glutin fork successfully compiles on windows, but then the config.rs goes looking for a glutin::{mods, Mods} and fails to find them.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the Glutin event system has totally changed in later commits.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on getting Glutin to work on the windows build?\r\nIs the correct action to implement clear_window for this pegged commit?\r\nOr is the correct action to bump up to the latest Glutin and fix the issues with the event handling?\r\n\r\nThere is also a whole bunch of unix specific stuff that the code goes looking for, which obviously fail to compile, but that seems more straightforward to fix, or at least I consider that to be a battle for another day lol.\r\n\r\nHere is a Gist with the Rust Compiler Outputs for reference:\r\n(Shows the output for both the old and the new revisions of Glutin)\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/rayman22201/6672e595277c8077472d2ac66a065099","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/273406150/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rayman22201","id":665285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTI4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/665285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman22201","html_url":"https://github.com/rayman22201","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman22201/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman22201/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman22201/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman22201/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman22201/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman22201/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman22201/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman22201/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rayman22201/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":927037372,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTI3MDM3Mzcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/927037372","actor":{"login":"rigtorp","id":178027,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODAyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp","html_url":"https://github.com/rigtorp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-18T07:47:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":927037373,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDkyNzAzNzM3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/927037373","actor":{"login":"rigtorp","id":178027,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODAyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/178027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp","html_url":"https://github.com/rigtorp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rigtorp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-18T07:47:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":927037374,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTI3MDM3Mzc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/927037374","actor":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-18T07:47:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":927037375,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDkyNzAzNzM3NQ==","url":"https://api.gith
