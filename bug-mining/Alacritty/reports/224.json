This is mainly caused by a lack of clear distinction between moving inside the window, outside the window and inside the padding.\r\n\r\nOne of the issues that is present in the latest master is that when moving from the message bar's close button to the padding, the mouse cursor will not be reset.\r\n\r\nHowever this also creates problems with https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/pull/2896, since the column/line is always set even in the padding, URLs are highlighted when moving from URL directly to the padding.\r\n\r\nLeaving the viewport currently also isn't tracked correctly. While the mouse is outside the window, the stored mouse positions still present it as within the window boundaries.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2898/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
