This can be extremely annoying when the goal is to just get some bold text with non-bright colors and it's not necessary to use this if you actually do want to use bright colors. To make each escape do one thing and do that well, the option `draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors` is currently available to change this behavior.\r\n\r\nGenerally, I think it makes more sense to have this option disabled by default, however a choice was made against that for compatibility with other terminal emulators and keeping up with user expectations.\r\n\r\nKitty has never had any way to get this mixed bold escape and it has come to my knowledge in #2776 that gnome has recently disconnected the bold and bright escapes by default too. With other terminal emulators changing this and offering the chance to make right what has been done wrong in the past, I think it would be a good choice to follow suit here.\r\n\r\nHowever, we're talking about a default option here, so what really matters is how most people feel about this, so I'd like to take this opportunity to get some comments on this possible change. Maybe @kchibisov and @nixpulvis can chime in, however I'm really curious about all kinds of opinions (both for and against this).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2779/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":5,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2779/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
