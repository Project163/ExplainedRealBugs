[here](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1554#issuecomment-648043457).\r\n\r\nOn a Mac what will be combination to expand a selection, noting that Macbooks only have a trackpad and Mac desktop mice only have one button.\r\n\r\nDouble tap?\r\nCtrl + click?\r\nSomething else? Or both?\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\nP.S. Selection expansion is a very important feature, so I very much look forward to it's arrival.

Alacritty support,\r\n\r\nOne of the major features of the 0.5 release will be selection expansion via the right-mouse-button.\r\n\r\nI have toyed with the release candidate and selection enhancement is a very nice addition, many thanks.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is currently limited to character expansion only. Say for instance one double clicks a word, then expands the selection, the starting and end points will be character sliced depending on where the start and end clicks took place, which is a little jarring since the double click word boundary will suddenly disappear.\r\n\r\niTerm2 (via control-click) and GNOME Terminal (via shift-click) does character expansion if the original selection was a simply mouse drag, but they will do whole of word expansion if the original selection was a double click word selection. This proves useful in expanding a selection word-by-word-by-word, for example selecting a complete sentence.\r\n\r\nHopefully in future the same mechanism Alacritty already uses for double-click word selection can filter through to selection expansion allowing users word-by-word expansion in addition to the current character-by-character expansion.\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4014/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/2751606639","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1554#issuecomment-2751606639","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1554","id":2751606639,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxkop86kAi9v","user":{"login":"farhankaz","id":38009491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MDA5NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38009491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhankaz","html_url":"https://github.com/farhankaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhankaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhankaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhankaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhankaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhankaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhankaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhankaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhankaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/farhankaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-25T15:12:51Z","updated_at":"2025-03-25T15:12:51Z","body":"Would be good to document this more prominently.
