And it seems to report that it indeed is a valid URL. Looking at stuff like `about:config`, I'd assume that this is not a bug in the URL crate, but that this is indeed a valid URL.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned in a different issue, but maybe we should be more restrictive? My initial idea was to make as much valid stuff clickable as possible, but that could be reevaluated. Maybe a fixed set of protocols should be selected? That certainly would introduce the danger of breaking some usecases though.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/434416540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1935926845,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5MzU5MjY4NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1935926845","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-30T18:26:05Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1935926850,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5MzU5MjY4NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1935926850","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-30T18:26:05Z","label":{"name":"S -

I'm sure we could try going without, otherwise we'd probably have to either prepend `http(s)://` when the potential URL starts with `www.` or just ignore `www.alacritty.io` as a valid URL.\r\n\r\nThe more I think about this, the more I like the idea of just accepting a limited amount of protocols. I think we've already got a fairly big collection in this issue, so I doubt people would run into a lot of problems. And we could always expand that when users run into problems. I'd recommend against making these a configuration option

Dropping the dependency on `url` to do something like `if buf.starts_with('http://') || buf.starts_with('https://') || buf.starts_with('mailto://')...` or something similar would work too, but once we start parsing parts / adding a regex I'd err on re-using the work done on url.

#1727 would help with alacritty incorrectly picking up URLs where there are none, in all cases the URL detection is too liberal. In `::` namespaced code (e.g. rust), the following line is considered to contain a URL, beginning at `iMessage::`\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n    ┆   let attachment = imessage::get_attachment(&self.db, request.guid)?; \r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe URLs should, at minimum, be required to match `\\b(?<scheme>[a-zA-Z]+:\\/\\/`. \r\n\r\n(Special leniency may be given for matching local `file:///` paths if that is desired (e.g. additionally matching `C:\\foo.txt` or `/var/db/foo`) as special \"local URIs\", probably gated behind an option given their prevalence in terminal output.)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is probably dependent on the definition of \"URI\" as some RFCs (for example, RFC2806) decided to go with `scheme:address` as a URI, but I think valid cases for handling that (esp. since alacritty does not offer a per-scheme handler for URIs but rather just one catch-all handler to configure) are few and far
