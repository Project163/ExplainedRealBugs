U+259F) Terminal graphic characters\r\n\r\nCurrently, they simply use the font's glygh for rendering, which cannot accurately fill a whole cell (or some borders) and instead leave a thin 0.5-1px border.\r\nThe following code *should* print a 2x2 full block, but currently it doesn't. There's a thin gap between adjacent cell (both between columns and rows)\r\n`printf '██\\n██\\n'`\r\n\r\n![blocks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14816024/132945334-34e6f28e-40b7-47ea-9037-29119dbf7663.png)\r\n\r\nI tried all installed FreeType fonts including `Noto Sans Mono`, `Free Mono` and `Sarasa Mono` but none of them work. So I think it's not an issue of individual fonts, but some limitations of FreeType itself.\r\n\r\n### Proposal \r\n\r\nSpecially handle these block-like characters to make them *accurately fully* fill cell (or borders). There are also many terminals did so, including:\r\n- GNOME vte: https://github.com/GNOME/vte/commit/154abade902850afb44115cccf8fcac51fc082f0\r\n- Kitty: https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/commit/e95c789d4bf6e52587b39ff10f419dd4442e92dd\r\n- Konsole: Enabled special treatment by default. Can be disabled by a setting `Use line characters contained in font` in `Appearance` (then it behaves the same as current `alacritty`).\r\n\r\n### Affected programs\r\n\r\nPrograms using these characters to print ASCII art, graphics, or indicators. Some users also use them in shell prompts.\r\n\r\n`neofetch`:\r\n![nixos](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14816024/132945876-b2c9a706-1b21-4144-9531-1d60762d6eb5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Linux\r\nVersion: Current master cf35a2019162c6055e4a4c152976a424ba10869d\r\nLinux: X11, KDE\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5485/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5485/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
