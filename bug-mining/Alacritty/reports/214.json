Moreover some users are running Alacritty without any additional configuration, so they don't need it anyway. In addition, our config file is a big YAML file and lots of it sections are optional, so advertising default config is bad for migration.\r\n\r\nI'm proposing to remove automatic config generation entirely. This approach has a drawback of forcing users to obtain *right* config from external resources (e.g. github.com), however we can add command line option to generate default configuration file and put it in specified path (user have to put generated file to a proper location themself).\r\n\r\n(1) This is an example for macOS/Linux systems, the same thing applies to Windows.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2818/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2818/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
