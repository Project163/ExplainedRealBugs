Summary\r\n\r\nThis fixes #8509.\r\n\r\nWhen Kitty's keyboard protocol is used and [Report all keys as escape codes flag (8)](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/#report-all-keys-as-escape-codes) is enabled, modifier key escape codes trigger the usual \"write something to the terminal\" code path, which clears the selection / scrolls down etc.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is mostly unexpected, and makes some actions more painful to perform (for instance copying text becomes harder: hitting CTRL to begin the CTRL+SHIFT+C sequence clears the selection).\r\n\r\nThis patch clears the selection only if the key event is **not** a modifier key, which aligns with Alacritty's usual behavior.\r\n\r\n# Notes\r\n\r\n- I have not included any tests because as far as I can see there's no way to have a proper test: from my attempts ref tests can't handle such niche behavior, but I might be wrong.\r\n- Reviewers should keep in mind that I'm not fluent in Rust, if there's a more elegant / canonical way to write this, please let me
