commit adds the concept of a \"title stack\" to the terminal. Some programs (e.g. vim) send control sequences `CSI 22 ; 0` (push title) and `CSI 23 ; 0` (pop title). Clues on how to handles these were taken from a couple of other terminal emulators ([Gnome Terminal](https://github.com/GNOME/vte/commit/23c44f1f18b7985d9fba3205500d8873ecde51aa), [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/commit/3067103b188c55d594918d1525d397cb523f8fea)).\r\n\r\nThe title stack is mainly just a history of previous titles. Applications can push the current title onto the stack, and pop it back off (setting the window title in the process).\r\n\r\nTo implement this, the Alacritty `Term` must have two new pieces of state: `title` (the mirror of what is set in the Glutin window) and `title_stack` (the history of titles if pushed onto). When control sequence 22 is received, then a title is pushed, and 23 pops and sets the Glutin window title.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #2840","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2857/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2857/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2711303881,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjcxMTMwMzg4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/2711303881","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-14T17:51:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2711303965,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI3MTEzMDM5NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/2711303965","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"401c2aab964b60e8c3b072e5098ba8e366d04944","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/commits/401c2aab964b60e8c3b072e5098ba8e366d04944","created_at":"2019-10-14T17:51:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3249249064,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMyNDkyNDkwNjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3249249064","actor":{"login":"roychoo","id":1853311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTMzMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo","html_url":"https://github.com/roychoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roychoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d10ff90bc27440286681cd568f8cc9cfdbd9aba2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/roychoo/alacritty/commits/d10ff90bc27440286681cd568f8cc9cfdbd9aba2","created_at":"2020-04-19T16:47:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
