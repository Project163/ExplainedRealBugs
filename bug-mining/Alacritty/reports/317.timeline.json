#1771 **Load colors from Xresources.**\r\n\r\n## Proposed Changes\r\n  - **alacritty.yml**: Adds a new config option on colors: `use_xrdb: bool`\r\n  - **alacritty_terminal/Cargo.toml**: Adds the external (and very new) crate [xrdb](https://crates.io/crates/xrdb) \r\n  - **alacritty_terminal/src/config/colors.rs**: Adds new field for deserialize `use_xrdb`\r\n  - **alacritty_terminal/src/term/color.rs**: Adds a new private function\r\n    `xrdb_colors -> bool` that will check for the `use_xrdb` option and try to\r\n    load colors using the xrdb lib. If any of the previous is false or fails, it\r\n    returns false, which leads to previus normal flow on fill_named. Otherwise\r\n    it adds the expected xrdb to NamedColor.\r\n\r\n## New dependencies?\r\nYes, [xrdb](https://crates.io/crates/xrdb).\r\n\r\n### Warning:\r\n- I am still starting to learn Rust\r\n- This is my first serious PR ever ;)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3553/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/609059939","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3440#issuecomment-609059939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3440","id":609059939,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTA1OTkzOQ==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-04T17:11:55Z","updated_at":"2020-04-04T17:11:55Z","body":"I've decided to move it to a separate page, since the escape sequence reference is mostly unrelated to Alacritty's support for them.

If someone is interested in outlining their ideas, a tracking issue should be created for the escape with their reasoning about it.
