This is something I usually like to set for my terminals.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't immediately obvious to me how to set the default values for this. I dug into the code to find it was set from the cli. Setting the `-d` option does work. As far as I can tell, this requires updating `Alacritty.desktop` to set.\r\n\r\nI think this is a common option and it would be nice to have the default values set in `alacritty.yml`, but still allow the cli args to supersede. I imagine this should be easy, I can take a pass at this if needed.\r\n\r\nThank you and great work!!\r\n\r\nShane","closed_by":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/370/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/370/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
