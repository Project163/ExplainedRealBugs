It seems that when I try to launch it, it automatically tries to use the configured `lines` and `columns` for the window size. Then resizes itself to fit the whole tiled window (which is often obviously larger than the configured `lines` and `column` sizes).\r\n\r\nThis creates the issue that when you launch the program, you first see it sized in its configured `lines` and `columns`, then you see it resize itself momentarily. In previous versions this wasn't the case. It sorta just used whatever the window manager tells it to. And pops right into existence with the correct window dimensions (despite having configured `lines` and `columns`).\r\n\r\nIn previous versions, the `lines` and `columns` seems to be used only when the window manager tells it that its floating. But now in 0.4.0, it seems like it insists on using those two settings on startup even when tiled (but then just resizes itself moments later to adhere to the window manager calls).\r\n\r\nHere's a video recording of the issue for reference: [https://imgur.com/a/VSzK69z](https://imgur.com/a/VSzK69z)\r\n\r\nYou can ignore the tearing on the video as that seems to be part of the recording. What you should notice is how in the previous version, the terminal sorta just pops right in the screen. Whereas now in 0.4.0, it's now a small little window first (or whatever size you give it), then it resizes itself.\r\n\r\nThat's not really an issue when you just open one or two terminals, then use it for the whole day. But when you have to open like 50 terminals throughout the day for the stuff you do, it becomes really annoying.\r\n\r\nI'm running my X server with xf86-video-intel, and testing against the modesetting driver, the issues seems to persist. Telling the xf86-video-intel driver to use DRI2 (instead of DRI3) seems to make the issue go away. Though I was hoping that I wouldn't have switch to DRI2 for my X server, because it breaks a bunch of my mpv settings. This is all running on a ThinkPad X220 with Intel HD 3000 graphics.\r\n\r\n# System\r\n\r\n| | |\r\n|------------------------|---------|\r\n| Operating System | Linux |\r\n| Alacritty Version | alacritty 0.4.0 |\r\n| Display Server | X11 |\r\n| Window Manager | bspwm |\r\n| Compositor | picom |\r\n\r\n# Logs\r\n\r\nSome probably relevant startup logs:\r\n\r\n| Command | Link |\r\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\r\n| `alacritty -vv` (0.3.3) | [https://pastebin.com/yTwV8wSy](https://pastebin.com/yTwV8wSy) |\r\n| `alacritty -vv` (0.4.0) | [https://pastebin.com/uHHPCKxu](https://pastebin.com/uHHPCKxu) |\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3061/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3061/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
