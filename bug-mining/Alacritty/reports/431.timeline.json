At that point it's not really about *remapping* something, but more about disabling a built-in feature. And while I can see that some people might not want to use certain features like selection expansion, I'm not sure how much sense it makes to let them disable it and bind it to something else.\r\n\r\nThe density of bindings on the mouse is relatively high, so I think the main benefit of custom mouse bindings is for auxiliary buttons and maybe binding to some things that do nothing. I'm not so sure about overriding built-in options.\r\n\r\nThat said, alt + right/left is currently not bound to anything, but cannot be used since we just ignore the modifier. So I don't see a good reason why we wouldn't exclude that from our bindings explicitly so the user can make use of that. But I don't see a lot of users binding things to alt + RMB/LMB anyways.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/674455023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/674469306","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4132#issuecomment-674469306","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4132","id":674469306,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3NDQ2OTMwNg==","user":{"login":"tribou","id":1641390,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDEzOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641390?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tribou","html_url":"https://github.com/tribou","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tribou/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tribou/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tribou/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tribou/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tribou/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tribou/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tribou/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tribou/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tribou/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-16T02:28:48Z","updated_at":"2020-08-16T02:28:48Z","body":"Thanks again for considering.
