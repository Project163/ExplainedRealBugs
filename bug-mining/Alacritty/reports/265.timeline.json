I'd hope applications would be able to adapt, generally. Though, we'd just be changing the default value of `draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors` so there'd be an easy solution for our users.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I googled \"ANSI Bold\" and the first link I got was this one: http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildyourownCommandLinewithANSIescapecodes.html, which makes it seem like \"Bold\" and \"Bright\" are the same thing, so it's pretty clear this is a confused topic in the wild.\r\n\r\nI've had (most) of my bright colors set to the same color as the non-bright version, which I'm thinking was probably a result of me not knowing about this bright/bold option.

option has some \"historical\" background, for example it could break\r\nncurses applications like alsamixer, however the default to `true`\r\nseems strange nowadays, because it makes impossible to draw bold text in\r\na \"normal\" color. Some other terminals (e.g. vte, kitty) also started default to\r\n`false` here.\r\n\r\nWe're not removing the option, but just flipping a bit, and knowing that users\r\ntend to copy paste our config in a past, will likely continue to have it\r\ndefaulted to `true` in their configuration files. The only problem is the users\r\nwho don't have this option in a config file now or new users, however the change\r\nin color is noticeable and it also stated very clear in our configuration
