use alacritty on multiple platforms such that the dotfiles between them is kept in sync (using softlinks and Dropbox, though that is not important).\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to have slightly tweaked configuration on each system (e.g. larger font sizes on one system, `use_thin_strokes` on one system, light/dark color themes, etc.).\r\n\r\nRight now, the config is read only from one single file:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/blob/8990aa4568ea8a7481f827512b7487be4d39332a/src/main.rs#L65-L75\r\n\r\nWould there be interest in converting `config_path` to an array and such that all the configs files are read in the said order:\r\n\r\n    /// 1. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty/alacritty.yml\r\n    /// 2. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/alacritty.yml\r\n    /// 3.

would allow me to keep, say, `$HOME/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml` synced between the systems while keeping local configuration in `$HOME/.alacritty.yml`.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we can add a file to the list, i.e. `$HOME/.alacritty.local.yml`, which will be exclusively used to override the preferences read from other files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/779/reactions","total_count":17,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":4,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/779/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/436435859","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1258#issuecomment-436435859","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1258","id":436435859,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNjQzNTg1OQ==","user":{"login":"NickeZ","id":492753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Mjc1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/492753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickeZ","html_url":"https://github.com/NickeZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickeZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickeZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickeZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickeZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickeZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickeZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickeZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickeZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NickeZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-06T22:41:07Z","updated_at":"2018-11-06T22:41:07Z","body":"I

when using any given terminal with a tiling window manager, it is crucial to to know which window is focused. With many terminals open, things can get confusing fast. One way to tell the focused and the no focused windows apart, is to slightly change the background. As the background is a big area, even a small change is recognized by the human eye.\r\n\r\n#### Proposal:\r\n\r\n1. Add a subgroup `not-focused` to the `colors` group in the config. This subgroup contains all the keys of the ordinary `color` group, and each value defaults to the depending value of the ordinary `colors` group.\r\nIf the an alacritty instance is focused, use the values from the ordinary `colors` group, else use the `not-focused` group.\r\n2. Move the `background_opacity` key to the `colors` group. I would consider the opacity as part of the visual appearance. So for a given colorscheme, the opacity should be with the colors, not somewhere else.\r\n3. Consider renaming the `colors` group to `visual` or something with a similar meaning. Once again, I think it's desirable to have all the visual aspects in one place.\r\n\r\n#### Benefits\r\n\r\n+ Further integration of common principals regarding human perception\r\n+ Having another feature which is not broadly available to other terminals\r\n+ Possible eye candy\r\n     + Think of a terminal which is colorful when focused, but all black, white and grey tones when not focused\r\n     + Or almost no opacity on focus, but higher opacity when not focused\r\n     + ...\r\n+ Better structured config\r\n\r\n#### Demonstration\r\n\r\nSee how one can easily determine which of the given terminals is focused, despite having no borders, no big fonts or other unique indicators of focus (the orange title indicates focus, but as the background and other elements are colored orange too).\r\n\r\n**With focus dependant background:**\r\n![screenshot_20190107_123717](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20400405/50766336-1427b480-1279-11e9-93b0-2cc67f3a33ad.png)\r\n**Without:**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20400405/50766704-82b94200-127a-11e9-8475-8f445c60f211.png)\r\n\r\nOf course this is one thing you can do with it, but there is many other possibilities to use this.\r\n\r\nWhat are you thoughts on this? I'm happy for feedback, whether this might be a desirable feature or whether it is in contradiction to `alacritty`s principals.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1982/reactions","total_count":37,"+1":37,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1982/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3681289989,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM2ODEyODk5ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3681289989","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2056ffb88fa9a128e342ad303961658ee571cd41","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisduerr/alacritty/commits/2056ffb88fa9a128e342ad303961658ee571cd41","created_at":"2020-08-21T22:06:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-21T22:06:34Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T22:06:34Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4159","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4159/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4159/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4159/events","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/4159","id":683851291,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDcxODc0NTQ3","number":4159,"title":"Add
