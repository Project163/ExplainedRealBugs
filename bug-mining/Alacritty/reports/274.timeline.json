am using the Courier Prime font.  Alacritty renders it noticeably thicker than other apps.  When Alacritty displays it in bold, it's thicker still, which is correct behavior but it becomes so bold that it is difficult to read.  I've found some similar issues, namely #3257, but that issue was seemingly resolved well over a year ago.\r\n\r\nI was using an out-of-date version of Alacritty (0.5.0), but updated to the most recent one (0.9.0) hoping it would fix the issue, but it persists.  I'm using the prebuilt MacOS binaries.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot of Sublime Text (top) and Alacritty (bottom) rendering the same text in this font at size 18.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-10-28 at 11 00 09 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/435744/139293035-cacb7fda-f7e2-47b3-81fc-82b040438e81.png)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5568/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
