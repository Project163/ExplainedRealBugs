Same for `Shift+{PageUp,PageDown}`, which I bound to tmux `previous-page` and `next-page`.\r\n\r\nThen I'm unsure what to do at this point:\r\n\r\n* Is this a bug?\r\n* If not, is it missing configuration? I see in my `alacritty.yml` that the *working* key combinations are listed in `key_bindings` (e.g. `{ key: Left, mods: Shift, chars: \"\\x1b[1;2D\"}`) and indeed my *non-working* Ctrl+PgUp/Dn are not bound.\r\n    * So I'd like to create two such bindings for Ctrl+PgUp/Down, but I have no idea what `chars` I should bind (Shift+Left was `\\x1b[1;2D`, what is Ctrl+PgUp? My googling attempts were unsuccessful as I don't know how to *name* this thing I'm looking for: what is this string? A \"tty character\"? a \"tty sequence\"?\r\n    * To prevent questions like mine, it would be awesome to guide users to finding `chars`. What do you think of either linking to a reference table, or suggesting some interactive unix tool capturing keystrokes and returning the equivalent tty keycode? That could be part of README.md or, better, a comment in the default YAML.\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
