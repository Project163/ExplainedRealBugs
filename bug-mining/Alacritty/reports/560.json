I have converted it using `alacritty migrate` from my yml config from before, but it creates a separate heading for every single key bind and this is not practical. \r\n\r\nIn reviewing the docs, \r\n\r\n```\r\nExample: [keyboard]++ bindings = [++ { key = \"N\", mods = \"Control|Shift\", action = \"CreateNewWindow\" },++ { key = \"L\", mods = \"Control|Shift\", chars = \"l\" },++ ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nSee _keyboard.bindings_ for full documentation on _mods_, _mode_, _action_,\r\nand _chars_.\r\n\r\nWhen an application running within Alacritty captures the mouse, the `Shift`\r\nmodifier can be used to suppress mouse reporting. If no action is found for\r\nthe event, actions for the event without the `Shift` modifier are triggered\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\n*mouse* = _\"Middle\"_ | _\"Left\"_ | _\"Right\"_ | _\"Back\"_ | _\"Forward\"_ | _<integer>_\r\n\r\n\tMouse button which needs to be pressed to trigger this binding.\r\n\r\n*action* = *<keyboard.bindings.action>* | _\"ExpandSelection\"_\r\n\r\n\t*ExpandSelection*\r\n\t\tExpand the selection to the current mouse cursor location.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\t*[mouse]*++\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wish I had something more helpful or specific to say but honestly none of this documentation really makes any sense. All the components we're used to seeing before are here but it's shocking to find lacking here a concrete example, only abstract symbolic examples. In particular it is not understood what `++` means. \r\n\r\nMy simple attempt to bind mouse buttons results in failure: \r\n\r\n```\r\n[mouse]\r\nhide_when_typing = true\r\nbindings = [ { mouse = \"Middle\", action = \"PasteSelection\" }, { mouse = \"Back\", chars = \"abc\" } ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom logfile:\r\n```\r\n[13.304506648s] [ERROR] [alacritty_config_derive] Config error: duplicate field `mouse`\r\n                                                  ; ignoring binding\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"unphased","id":1542910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI5MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1542910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/unphased","html_url":"https://github.com/unphased","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unphased/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unphased/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unphased/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unphased/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unphased/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unphased/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unphased/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unphased/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/unphased/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7413/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7413/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
