So I think the primary question now would be how to implement it. So which color should be used.\r\n\r\nURxvt acts like same color fg and bg is the default text background on default text foreground when inversed. So the foreground is the default bg and the bg is the default foreground.\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to just reset one of the colors back to the default, however in those cases there would still always be a scenario where the text would be invisible. I think using the default bg as fg and the default fg as bg is the only way to reliably make same-color text and background visible.\r\n\r\nURxvt applies this behavior both when selected **and** when the inversion escape is used (so `echo -e \"\\e[7;31;41mTEST\"` will result to be the same as selecting same-color fg and bg). And if this is inverted again using the selection the visible colors are not inverted but it's inverted back to the same bg on same fg colors. So Reverse and Selection do the same thing and are XORed together to check whether they should be applied. I think this makes sense and is what would be expected.\r\n\r\nURxvt does not seem to implement the hidden escape sequence (`echo -e \"\\e[8mHIDDEN\"`), so I'm not sure what we should do here. There's two choices, either we act like it's same fg on same bg and make it visible during selection, or we say that when things are hidden they'll stay hidden no matter what. XTerm does not show same bg/fg during selection and Termite (VTE) and Kitty both seem to have fixed selection fg/bg colors without supporting inversion (the reverse escape escape does not have special handling) and Kitty also does not support the hidden escape. According to some helpful people on IRC Konsole does not support inverting during selection either when bg/fg is the same.\r\n\r\nSo as far as I can tell, we'd be the first to make a decision about this and I'm unsure which decision would be \"correct\" here. In a way, it might be better to keep text which is intended to be hidden, hidden. So a stray inverting escape sequence can't accidentally expose passwords etc. On the other hand it would probably be more consistent to always show hidden text during selection, no matter what caused that text to be hidden.\r\n\r\nSince this issue seems to suggest that same bg/fg is mainly used for spoilers and not the hidden escape sequence, which means I'm not aware of any advantage to show the hidden text, I'd be for keeping hidden text hidden. However I'd be very curious what other people think about it. If the sequence is used to hide passwords, the selection could be used as a \"show password text\" kinda thing similar to what is sometimes available with password fields in GUIs too.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/483715476/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/483717156","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2315#issuecomment-483717156","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2315","id":483717156,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MzcxNzE1Ng==","user":{"login":"ddevault","id":1310872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTA4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1310872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevault","html_url":"https://github.com/ddevault","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevault/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevault/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevault/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevault/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevault/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevault/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevault/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevault/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ddevault/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-16T15:42:52Z","updated_at":"2019-04-16T15:42:52Z","body":"Hiding passwords with the same fg/bg is a very stupid idea and should not be supported.
