But there's an easy way to figure out if it's buffering the event until focus, or if the window is just not redrawn. If you put a `println!(\"aaontehu\")` in the event handling section (https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/commit/57281363503ddd1ebb373ed5de2b84c79d5aa3aa#diff-3d7686001860aa382f8b9c18554cc138R343), you should see when the event is actually first received. So if it shows the event is received but doesn't show up in the terminal, I might need to set the `dirty` flag. @jedahan
