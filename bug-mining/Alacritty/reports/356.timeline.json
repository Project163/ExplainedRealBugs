one important note, is that this config option should be in a special section proposed [there](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3386), so you'll likely implement infrastructure for this issue as well in your PR, however you don't have to add any additional OSCs(DEC) into it, besides the one for setting

by a user, it's just an escape sequence that could be received from any program and should be supported, allowing to define if the Urgent event should be send or not .\r\n\r\nYeah, but if you disable this escape(restrictions I'm talking in #3386) it should prevent urgent setting, and so we can don't set urgent if that setting was disabled by the user at all, leaving it enabled by default, and acting like it was enabled. Also, those escapes are pretty strange and unlikely are used.\r\n\r\n>And the user can choose to never allow the bell to be urgent using the new config options you suggest in #3386 . Is that correct ?\r\n\r\nKind of, you can blacklist DEC 1042 in this options. However user could actually want to disable it and set resource to some value by default. So I feel like we should have a way to set default behavior for those escapes, what do you think @chrisduerr ? I feel like we need special syntax to describe each osc in a kind of unique way. Something like:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nescapes:\r\n- { resource: UrgentOnBell, resource: enabled/disabled, toggle_with_escape: true/false }\r\n```\r\nI'm not sure where it should be an array, since you can't work with them generically, I also don't really like suggested naming, but it's just some idea, maybe we can have something like:\r\n```yaml\r\n- UrgentOnBell\r\n  resource: enabled.\r\n  toggle_with_escape: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm really not sure what syntax should we use and how it should work together.\r\n\r\nHowever you can at least implement DEC 1042 without those special option and any other config related option, since internal infrastructure to add this escape should be the same, regardless of new config options (e.g. toggling urgency, when we're getting this escape sequence).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/609524745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3203329833,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzIwMzMyOTgzMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3203329833","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-06T01:40:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3203329835,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMyMDMzMjk4MzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3203329835","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-06T01:40:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/609812827","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2950#issuecomment-609812827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2950","id":609812827,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwOTgxMjgyNw==","user":{"login":"nixpulvis","id":715947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTk0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/715947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis","html_url":"https://github.com/nixpulvis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_a
