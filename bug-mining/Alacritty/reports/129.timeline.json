is not an issue but rather a question to better understand the default behaviour of the config file.\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to have all the keybindings configured in the config file (as they are stated in the default config files), or can I remove them and only keep the ones that I have changed?\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is that, does Alacritty have default hardcoded keybindings for different platforms like Linux and macOS which work in the same way as other configuration options.\r\nFor example the boolean configuration options need to be only specified in the config file, if the user needs to set them to `true`, the default value of `false` is implied and in that case the option can be removed from the config file. I am assuming this is the default behavior?\r\n\r\nAnother example would be the `selection.semantic_escape_chars`, can it be removed from the config file if the user has not changed

am making a module for configuring alacritty using Nix.\r\nIt is pretty tedious to make an option for each and every configuration option available in alacritty, especially the ones that most users may never touch.\r\nWould it be possible to make all options optional, such that they fallback to the default values provided in https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/blob/master/alacritty.yml ?\r\nThis makes it possible for the user to make a minimal configuration, thus it is easy to see what you have actually changed, and what is still default.\r\nThis is the module I am speaking of:
