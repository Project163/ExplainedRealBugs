Copy the selection to clipboard\r\n    - Paste the selection to the prompt directly without copying it to clipboard\r\n- Fuzzy-search + smart text blocks extraction (via `extrakto` plugin):\r\n    - Open URL in browser\r\n    - Open file path in the text editor\r\n    - Copy to clipboard\r\n    - and many more.\r\n\r\nAnd after I saw this list, I realized that this is too much for alacritty, so I'll always be using tmux.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/357012076/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"max-baz","id":1177900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzc5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1177900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz","html_url":"https://github.com/max-baz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/max-baz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/357013647","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1017#issuecomment-357013647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1017","id":357013647,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NzAxMzY0Nw==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-11T18:12:55Z","updated_at":"2018-01-11T18:15:03Z","body":"I'm not saying something like a vim-mode might solve all of those.

is a potential compromise for fixing #1017.  Currently being unable to search the scrollback buffer severely limits its usefulness but at the same it's questionable whether this should be implemented directly in alacritty itself.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an action to spawn a new instance of alacritty with a user specified pager and then dump the contents of the scrollback buffer into the stdin of the new instance.  This neatly sidesteps the issue of having to implement search functionality in alacritty itself while giving users the freedom to use whichever pager best suits their needs.  The default is `less` but there's nothing stopping someone from using an editor like `vim` as their pager instead.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the scrollback buffer are first converted into a string (by iterating over every occupied cell) before being written out, which means we end up with a copy of the buffer in memory.  However since this is something that is only done in response to explicit user action, it shouldn't end up getting out of hand.\r\n\r\nThis is probably not fit for merging in its current state but I wanted to ask if this is something that would be accepted upstream before spending time cleaning it up.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2568/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/504651415","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1017#issuecomment-504651415","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1017","id":504651415,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDY1MTQxNQ==","user":{"login":"WloHu","id":22800245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODAwMjQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22800245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WloHu","html_url":"https://github.com/WloHu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WloHu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WloHu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WloHu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WloHu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WloHu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WloHu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WloHu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WloHu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WloHu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-22T10:05:16Z","updated_at":"2019-06-22T10:05:16Z","body":"I believe that \"selection mode\" was mentioned here: https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/262 and this would for sure solve that issue.

adds initial support for regex scrollback buffer search. While\r\nsearching should already be fully functional, the match is currently\r\nonly logged to stdout and not displayed in Alacritty.\r\n\r\nHowever the searching should already behave as intended.\r\n\r\nFixes #3672.\r\nFixes #1017.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of edgecases with this PR that need to be tested, I went through all of them but I doubt I've tested all permutations. So here's a list with things that would be useful to test:\r\n - Search from vi mode starting in last line\r\n - Search from vi mode above last line\r\n - Search without vi mode\r\n - Forward search\r\n - Backwards search\r\n - Goto match next start/end, previous start/end\r\n - Resize during search\r\n - Message bar\r\n - Start search while scrolled up\r\n - Search without history\r\n - Search with history and normal cursor at bottom\r\n - Search with history and normal cursor not at bottom (ctrl+l)\r\n - Immediate search while typing with match < 1000 lines away\r\n - Delayed search while typing with match > 1000 lines away\r\n\r\nThere are a few features I've intentionally left out that we should likely add in the future. I'll create issues for them as soon as this PR is merged:\r\n - Moving the cursor inside the search bar\r\n - Anchored searches using ^ and $","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3507/reactions","total_count":37,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":22,"rocket":15,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3507/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3157688604,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMxNTc2ODg2MDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3157688604","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"098e2a6c37818a7900ff34443c1ebde4fb9d4f28","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisduerr/alacritty/commits/098e2a6c37818a7900ff34443c1ebde4fb9d4f28","created_at":"2020-03-24T01:09:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
