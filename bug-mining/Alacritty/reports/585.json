Now, on Alacritty 0.13+, pressing the Pause key (and Scroll Lock, and presumably other keys I have not discovered yet) causes some weird spew to get emitted:\r\n\r\nOn v0.12.3:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ target/debug/alacritty --version\r\nalacritty 0.12.3 (5efb0690)\r\n$ xdotool key Pause\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd on v0.13.1 (note the `^[[57362u` spew to the terminal and some keys (`362u`) getting typed without me actually typing them):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ target/debug/alacritty --version\r\nalacritty 0.13.1 (fe2a3c56)\r\n$ xdotool key Pause; echo \"done\"\r\n^[[57362udone\r\n$ 362u\r\n```\r\n\r\nI performed a git bisect, and this behavior was introduced in https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/commit/cb03806e2ab85674c45e87e1bb24dfe2fd1a918c. I tried reading through that diff, but it's beyond me. cc-ing the author (@kchibisov), and hoping he knows what's up.\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n\r\nI was (sort of*) able to work around this by adding a `keyboard.binding` to my alacritty conf file to ignore these keys:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[keyboard]\r\nbindings = [\r\n    { key = \"Pause\", action = \"None\" },\r\n    { key = \"Pause\", mods = \"Shift\", action = \"None\" },\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n*I checked, and this causes these keypresses to be ignored by the kitty keyboard protocol implementation, which I don't want. Hopefully it doesn't matter, but if it's relevant, I can explain why I sometimes press keys such as Pause that I expect to have no visual output, yet I still want them to show up in the keyboard kitty protocol implementation.","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7623/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
