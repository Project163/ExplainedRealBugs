now the resizing implementation with scrollback has been really\r\ninefficient because it made use of APIs like `Vec::insert`. This has\r\nbeen rewored with this commit.\r\n\r\nA `len` property has been added to the `Storage` struct which keeps\r\ntrack of the actual length of the raw buffer. This has changed both\r\nshrinking and growing implementations.\r\n\r\nWith shrinking, no more lines are removed, only the `len` property is\r\nupdated to set all lines shrunk to an \"invisible\" state which cannot be\r\naccessed from the outside, this effectively changes it to a O(1)\r\noperation. The only issue with this would be memory consumption, but\r\nsince the maximum shrinkage is the number of lines on one screen, it\r\nshould be a rather small impacte (probabl <100 lines usually). If\r\ndesired it would be possible to change this to shrink the raw inner\r\nbuffer whenever there are more than X lines hidden.\r\n\r\nGrowing now works in a similar way to shrinking, if the \"invisible\"\r\nlines are enough, no new lines are inserted but rather the invisible\r\nbuffer is made visible again. Otherwise the amount of lines that still\r\nneeds to be inserted is added to the raw buffer, but instead of the\r\ninefficient `Vec::insert`, the `Vec::push` API is used now.\r\n\r\nThis is probably not an ideal implementation, but it should get us\r\nstarted on making this work properly in the scrollback PR.\r\nAny comments appreciated @jwilm.\r\n\r\nThis fixes
