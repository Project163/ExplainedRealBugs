However, up to my knowledge, [there is currently no way for applications to detect that](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/220).\r\n\r\nA lot of other terminals (terminator, iTerm2, konsole, hyper, ...) set the `COLORTERM` environment variable to `truecolor` to indicate that the terminal supports it (see https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728 for more details).\r\n\r\nIt is not a really great solution (it can fail if you start a terminal from another terminal, for example), but apparently there is currently no other standard.\r\n\r\nI would therefore propose that alacritty sets `COLORTERM=truecolor` in order for application developers to detect whether or not the terminal supports it.\r\n\r\n(I wanted to add a special case for alacritty, but I don't even know how to detect it. There doesn't seem to be any environment variable that clearly identifies alacritty?)","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1526/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
