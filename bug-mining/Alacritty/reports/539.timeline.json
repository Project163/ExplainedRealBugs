The second argument here is a timestamp of the events with milliseconds granularity, so by doing a `diff` between the ones adjustment ones we'll get the time between you've clicked. I'd say before that we don't rely on such a thing internally and we just use the current timestamp when we've seen event during event processing. But let's just compute the differences in time between those events.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[1135579.263] wl_pointer@20.button(2744, 907047, 272, 1)\r\n[1144375.881] wl_pointer@20.button(2761, 915854, 272, 1) // 8 seconds \r\n[1145720.100] wl_pointer@20.button(2768, 917182, 272, 1) // 1328ms \r\n[1146965.425] wl_pointer@20.button(2775, 918427, 272, 1) // 1245ms\r\n[1148190.285] wl_pointer@20.button(2782, 919637, 272, 1) // 1210 ms\r\n[1148588.580] wl_pointer@20.button(2787, 920014, 272, 1) // 377ms double click\r\n[1149762.438] wl_pointer@20.button(2794, 921217, 272, 1) // 1203ms\r\n[1150146.699] wl_pointer@20.button(2799, 921580, 272, 1) // 363ms double click\r\n[1151278.781] wl_pointer@20.button(2806, 922725, 272, 1) // 1145\r\n[1151641.759] wl_pointer@20.button(2811, 923102, 272, 1) // 377 ms , double click\r\n[1154566.434] wl_pointer@20.button(2828, 926028, 272, 1) // 3s\r\n[1154746.642]  -> xdg_toplevel@35.set_maximized()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you see on the wayland logs, the time between the clicks when you did double clicks were very close to 400ms. On libinput logs the time between the clicks were 150ms-200ms, this is for example what I have in wayland logs on sway and it matches libinput results on my end.\r\n\r\nFor now though, I'll try to rewrite and use the timestamps directly from the events, since they might provide better results. I'll come back to you with that eventually.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1633536576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1633869533","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7011#issuecomment-1633869533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7011","id":1633869533,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxkop85hYt7d","user":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-13T09:15:18Z","updated_at":"2023-07-13T09:15:18Z","body":"@darkblaze69 do you have any GNOME extensions installed?
