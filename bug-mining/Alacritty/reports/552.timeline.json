There are ways to get some part of the screen buffer, and blur that. Similar as to how a magnifier application or a screenshot tool work. IIRC URxvt supports blur through that as well. It is quite ugly though, because the blur is not updated when the URxvt window moves. My hope would be that this can be improved a lot if the blur is done on the GPU.

better.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/713685522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wucke13","id":20400405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDAwNDA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20400405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wucke13","html_url":"https://github.com/wucke13","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wucke13/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wucke13/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wucke13/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wucke13/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wucke13/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wucke13/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wucke13/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wucke13/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wucke13/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3904745418,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzkwNDc0NTQxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3904745418","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-21T16:06:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3904745421,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5MDQ3NDU0MjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3904745421","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-21T16:06:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/713688350","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/972#issuecomment-713688350","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/972","id":713688350,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMzY4ODM1MA==","user":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-21T16:10:55Z","updated_at":"2020-10
