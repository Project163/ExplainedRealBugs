Which operating system does the issue occur on?\r\n\r\nOpenBSD 6.5-current\r\n\r\n> Problem\r\n\r\n`nix:0.12.0` does not compile on OpenBSD. `nix:0.13.0` should, I believe.

For projects that are completely on sourcehut that might not be a problem but just for testing out the CI process might not be worth it especially since I'm not sure how well Rust would be supported.\r\n\r\nI'm surprised to see that there's github integration though.

So if we should decide to go with sourcehut for the future of at least BSD builds, I'd like to pay for the services we use rather than taking advantage of having reasonable popularity (which would be unfair to other, smaller projects imo).

So I think this is definitely the way forward for automatic BSD builds, especially since I'm not aware of any reasonable alternative. I'll have a play around with it this weekend to see how things pan out.\r\n\r\nThanks for the support

#2248.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is a draft for adding *BSD support to our CI, utilizing the [https://builds.sr.ht](https://builds.sr.ht) and [https://dispatch.sr.ht](https://dispatch.sr.ht) services.\r\n\r\nAs it is, there are a few problems with this (or rather, differences from Travis):\r\n- [ ] sequential execution of tasks (all subsequent tasks are blocked until completion)\r\n- [ ] lack of ability to restart a single, failed task\r\n- [ ] no way to specify allowed-failures (like we do with all nightly builds under Travis)\r\n  - I currently `|| true` all tests that would be an allowed-failure, which works but isn't as graceful, nor notifies when it fails\r\n- [ ] dispatch.sr.ht requires full access (r/w) to all repos in order to set up the webhook (see also: https://todo.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/dispatch.sr.ht/22)\r\n  - could maybe be worked around if dispatch.sr.ht were to provide a way to manually create a webhook?\r\n\r\nIn regards to points 1 and 2, we could just split every single task into its own file. I haven't tested if having subfolders in `.builds` would succeed, which could allow us to keep the folder from getting too hectic if we decide to move our other targets to sr.ht as well. This would also allow us to restart single tasks as well as have them all run in parallel.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n(the following are notes and not necessarily blockers)\r\n\r\n### FreeBSD\r\nMy current implementation uses `rustup` to install v1.36.0, stable, and nightly Rust toolchains. We could potentially drop 1.36.0 in favor of using Rust stable straight from FreeBSD's ports. This would also cull nightly, because neither package installs `rustup` for managing versions.\r\n\r\nExample build for the curious: https://builds.sr.ht/~cole_h/job/114951\r\n\r\n### OpenBSD\r\nOpenBSD is a Tier 3 target for Rust, which results in no `rustup` being built for it (available from rustup.rs, at least). This means we can only CI the available version, which at the time of writing is 1.38.0.\r\n\r\nExample build for the curious:
