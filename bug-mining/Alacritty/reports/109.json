If they are looking for a config setting and it's not in `cursor`, it probabl doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nA different solution than my proposal could be adding a `color` block inside the `cursor` block, so really everything related to `cursor` is inside of `cursor`. However then not everything related to `color` is in `color` and it might make the colorschemes in the wiki harder.\r\n\r\n### Transition Period\r\nIf we would just switch to this new format, or any other format, the current config file would break. I don't think it's a good idea to completely break the config without giving users a timeframe where they can fix existing issues.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation would be to support both variants in an initial transition period and warn the user when using the \"old\" way of doing things. Then after a certain while we could remove support for the old way to use these settings.\r\n\r\nAlternatively we could rewrite the config ourselves when detecting the old values for a certain amount of time and then remove this auto-converter once the transition period is over.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1080/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1080/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
