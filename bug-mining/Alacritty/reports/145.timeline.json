issue comes from event loop which needs to be notified when child process exits. Currently the `sigchld` function in `tty.rs` handles this event and just sets `SHOULD_EXIT` flag, while the event loop is waiting for new events from window system. One __hack__ can be manually faking an event to the terminal window using unsafe C code. The better solution is to create a new stream to `poll` and trigger it on `sigchld`. I don't have enough knowledge about the internal design and control flow, but am interested in fixing this.\r\n\r\nReproduction can be done by running a command that takes a while to finish automatically (such as `sync`) through `-e` as argument, under gdb to watch the traceback. Then killing it using `SIGSTOP` and looking `where` it is hanging (goes down to `poll`). Sending signal can be automatically done this way to avoid triggering unwanted key events (assuming one instance is running):\r\n```bash\r\n$ sleep 3 && pgrep alacritty | xargs kill

is a crack at handing `SIGCHLD` (and conceivably others) safely and correctly, taking a different approach to #1367 by using the well-known \"self-pipe trick\". This should allay concerns about non- _async-signal-safe_ functions in signal handlers.\r\n\r\nThe signal handler writes received `SIG*` numbers into a pipe, which wakes up the existing I/O event loop. The loop then delegates handling back to the `Pty`, which reads the pipe, and reacts appropriately.\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% certain on the finer points of this design, though, so I'd appreciate some feedback.\r\n\r\n- Fixes #915\r\n- Fixes #1276\r\n- Fixes
