However, spawning a new window through `alacritty msg create-window` doesn't thread through the token, so the new window cannot activate itself.\r\n\r\nMy use-case is a compositor bind to spawn a terminal which looks like: `alacritty msg create-window || alacritty`. This way, if an alacritty process already exists, it is re-used for (slightly) faster startup and less resource use. However, this currently doesn't work with xdg-activation because the token isn't passed through `msg create-window`.\r\n\r\nI imagine it can become more of a problem as compositors start to adopt stricter new window autofocus policies, or it can break the various \"show spinning cursor until the app opens\" things.\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Linux\r\nVersion: alacritty 0.14.0\r\nLinux/BSD: Wayland, niri\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/8337/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/8337/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
