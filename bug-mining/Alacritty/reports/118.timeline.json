support is added behind a config flag `enable_experimental_conpty_backend`, defaulted to `false`. When set to `true` then before the WinPty initialisation alacritty will try to spawn a Pseudoconsole process, and use that instead.\r\n\r\nI can confirm #1662 is fixed by this (and possibly others, I haven't searched too extensively). However there's a couple of pain points which is why I wanted to mark this experimental:\r\n\r\n- The ConPTY API only support synchronous pipes (rather than the asynchronous `Evented \"NamedPipe\"` from `mio_named_pipes`). So `windows.rs` has to change to dispatch over the two possible pipe types, and I added a local crate `mio_anonymous_pipes` to make these things `Evented` (using worker thread + intermediate buffer). Performance on those can likely be improved, tbh I'm hoping the problem goes away and we can move everything to `NamedPipe` if Microsoft lands https://github.com/Microsoft/console/issues/262 soon.\r\n\r\n- Sometimes the last column has characters from other lines \"ghosting\" after scrolls or other writes to the buffer. I haven't used Alacritty in WinPty mode much so I'm not sure if the problem is also present there. I suspect it's an issue where the ConPTY api is treating the cursor position as having moved to the next line already when alacritty thinks it's in the last column, but I want to investigate this further after we have some other user experience.\r\n\r\nFixes #1661.\r\nFixes
