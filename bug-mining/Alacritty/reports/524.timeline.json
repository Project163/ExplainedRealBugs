help users configure Alacritty more reliably, we should either warn, or throw errors when an unused YAML key is provided. I've been bit by this a number of times. There are a few ways I see silent unused keys causing issues.\r\n\r\n1. I forget what mapping a key should belong to, for example\r\n```yaml\r\nwindow:\r\n  title: Foo\r\n  dynamic_title: false\r\n```\r\n2. I misspell a key name (I'm a horrible speller)\r\n```yaml\r\nwindow:\r\n  decerations: none\r\n```\r\n3. I mess up indentation, since YAML wants to make things as hard for people as possible (taken from #3462)\r\n```yaml\r\ncolors:\r\n  primary:\r\n    background: '0x272822'\r\n    foreground: '0xF8F8F2'\r\n  normal:\r\n   black:   '0x272822'\r\n   # ...\r\n   white:   '0xF8F8F2'\r\n  bright:\r\n   black:   '0x75715E'\r\n   # ...  \r\n   white:   '0xF9F8F5'\r\n  background_opacity: 0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect each of these examples to be alerted to the user when they attempt them. Since they are all clearly errors. I'm sure I could hunt down issues for each of these cases, and there would be a number of them, however I'm also sure we are all aware of this issue, and it shouldn't need further motivation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps https://github.com/dtolnay/serde-ignored can save us for too much headache implementing this. The main concern is with allowing YAML templates (or whatever they are called) for more complex user configurations. Ideally only **used** templates would not cause a warning.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3467/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3467/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1368224779","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6592#issuecomment-1368224779","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6592","id":1368224779,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAxkop85RjXQL","user":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-31T14:45:26Z","updated_at":"2022-12-31T14:45:26Z","body":">@kchibisov You proposed this a while ago on IRC, do you think this is a bad idea?\r\n\r\nI do like toml more. In general what we can do is to have support for both at the same time with a warning to do a conversion with some alacritty flag. But having both at the same time doesn't sound like fun to maintain.\r\n\r\nI do wonder how stuff like multiple bindings will end up working.\r\n\r\n>Since as far as I know all previous issues with TOML have been fixed and escape sequences can be easily specified in TOML strings now, I think it would make sense to switch to TOML as our default format.\r\n\r\nIs that supported by serde at least?
