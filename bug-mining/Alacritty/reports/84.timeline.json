thanks to the help of @matthiaskrgr, we were able to track down the cause of this issue, or at least a way to reproduce it. In the process of doing so we've also noticed another related crash.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick guide to reproduce these issues:\r\n\r\nSemantic Crash:\r\n - Run `yes`\r\n - Start semantic selection with a doubleclick\r\n - Crash\r\n\r\nScrolling Crash:\r\n - Run `yes`\r\n - Try scrolling while `yes` is running\r\n\r\nThese issues both are related to the way the scrollback buffer works, with the semantic selection it will attempt to start a selection from the start point, however this is long out of range already, since `yes` pushed the starting point out of bounds.\r\n\r\nThe scrolling is probably a related issue, I haven't investigated this yet but I'd assume that since we're scrolling up the buffer now has an offset. When we run `yes`, the buffer doesn't automatically scroll down, but instead stays at the position where it initially was when scrolling. Then when the visible area is pushed out of bounds, a crash occurs.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/401548901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1709989781,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTcwOTk4OTc4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1709989781","actor":{"login":"matthiaskrgr","id":476013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjAxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/476013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiaskrgr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-30T15:47:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1709989782,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3MDk5ODk3ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1709989782","actor":{"login":"matthiaskrgr","id":476013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NjAxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/476013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr","html_url":"https://github.com/matthiaskrgr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthiaskrgr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-30T15:47:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1710006166,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3MTAwMDYxNjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1710006166","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f93e24167c570f9b65868b46fbbf946579bd7f36","commit_url":"https://api.

Now semantic\r\nselection, line selection and normal selection should all work without\r\ncrashing when new lines are shoving the selection out of bounds.\r\n\r\nThe other error was with the viewport being outside of the scrollback\r\nhistory. Since the default is to keep the scrollback buffer at its\r\ncurrent position when new lines are added, it is possible that the\r\nposition the scrollback buffer is at is suddenly shoved out of the\r\nvisible area. To fix this the `display_offset` is now limited to always\r\nbe an allowed value.\r\nIf a single line of the viewport is moved out of the history now, the\r\nviewport should move down a single line now, so only valid content is\r\ndisplayed, with multiple lines this process is repeated.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #1400 and also fixes #1406.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1402/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1712647659,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3MTI2NDc2NTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1712647659","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"07aaf05f7463a971e56de87e3b6b24e4153e5a98","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/commits/07aaf05f7463a971e56de87e3b6b24e4153e5a98","created_at":"2018-07-02T22:03:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/401952291","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1400#issuecomment-401952291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1400","id":401952291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTk1MjI5MQ==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-02T22:05:59Z","updated_at":"2018-07-02T22:05:59Z","body":"Fixed
