Also reproducible under sway with wlroots.\r\n\r\n**Description:** When pasting from any GTK app running with a Wayland backend (firefox, gedit, gnome-terminal) into Vim inside Alacritty, newlines are added after each line that is pasted.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce:**\r\n\r\n1. Open Alacritty inside Sway\r\n1. Start Vim with no configuration (vim defaults) `vim -u NONE`\r\n1. Disable legacy compatibility `:set nocompatible`\r\n1. Paste a block of code from any other GTK Wayland app (firefox, gedit, gnome-terminal) into Vim\r\n\r\n**What happens:** There are blank lines after each pasted line in Vim.\r\n\r\n**What I expected to happen:** Lines would be pasted as they were copied.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2844/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
