If you use a normal selection, you will select the content of the other vertical panes:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4927883/143588260-c46d8d0c-60d4-44bb-881b-d75b62e181dc.png)\r\n\r\nInstead, by using a rectangular select, we can select the content from a single pane:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4927883/143588413-67e12225-70a3-4345-8b55-d8f902ee2a3f.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, doing this in Alacritty doesn't remove trailing whitespaces, so the output will be a rectangle filled with whitespaces at the end of each line. Here is the output, in my editor which shows trailing whitespaces:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4927883/143588542-e6d8aebd-362e-4e3e-b4f3-fae7335144e8.png)\r\n\r\nUrxvt strips all trailing whitespaces from rectangular select. I think this would be a good idea to implement in Alacritty. The UI also indicates this by having a different selection display for the trailing whitespaces that will be stripped:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4927883/143588809-925ff28e-b1cc-4af1-9901-8ebdc777fb78.png)","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5638/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5638/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
