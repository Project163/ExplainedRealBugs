I saw [this issue](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7961) and thought it'd be an easy way to hopefully start contributing to one of my fav projects!  I added the 3 new commands and updated the scdoc files accordingly.  I briefly describe the behavior with these new changes below...\r\n\r\nUpon pressing `*` in visual mode, search for the highlighted text in the region, and in normal mode, grab the first semantic word at/after the cursor point in the same line, searching for that.  `#` similarly searches backwards.\r\n\r\nThis matches any word containing the search pattern, unlike vim which matches the exact pattern.  I tried getting the search to behave exactly like vim, but wrapping the region in \"\\\\<\\\\>\" didn't work, nor did using the negative lookahead/lookbehind operators (`(?!)`,`(?<!)`), but i figured this was prolly good enough.\r\n\r\nAlso added the visual `o` keybinding, which will move the cursor to the other side of a visual region.  Works as expected for all visual modes.  Contemplated adding the `O` key for switching the column of a visual block, but i doubt anyone even knows about this key, let alone has use for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/8099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/8099/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17505057627,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAxkop86IOIBszwAAAAQTYftb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/17505057627","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1b73dd45428a8639f0f7ec6e065283aeee563c89","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisduerr/alacritty/commits/1b73dd45428a8639f0f7ec6e065283aeee563c89","created_at":"2025-05-02T21:31:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-02T21:31:59Z","updated_at":"2025-05-02T21:31:59Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/8563","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/8563/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/8563/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/8563/events","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/8563","id":3036866935,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAxkop86UzFKF","number":8563,"title":"Add
