https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7778 by adding another field to `alacritty_terminal::tty::Options` and using those in `unix.rs` during the shell command building.\r\n\r\nSome questions came up along the way:\r\n\r\n* Are `tty::setup_env` vars supposed to be process-specific too in the unix case?\r\nhttps://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/8218c203032e6f42a20f31112c5e72abf6c3af83/alacritty_terminal/src/tty/mod.rs#L92 \r\n\r\nSeems like not, but wanted to double check.\r\n\r\n* There are no explicit *.md doc files related to alacritty_terminal, but should I mention this breaking change into root CHANGELOG.md? Something else?\r\n\r\n* re: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/7778#issuecomment-1966045017 change\r\nWas the idea to check that new `env` for the id?
