While YAML is an awful format even for experienced users, clearly it's completely impossible for inexperienced ones to grasp its concept. And the documentation of our configuration file with everything commented out by default probably doesn't help.\r\n\r\nSince as far as I know all previous issues with TOML have been fixed and escape sequences can be easily specified in TOML strings now, I think it would make sense to switch to TOML as our default format.\r\n\r\nIn a transitory period we could probably get away with just loading existing YAML files and writing them out as TOML, to allow for backward compatibility. This will probably produce somewhat messy TOML files, but I can't imagine an auto-generated TOML file would be much worse than a YAML file.\r\n\r\nThe only major drawbacks I see is that this is a rather big change that will no doubt annoy a bunch of people and some more advanced features of YAML (like anchors) are not supported in TOML. But nobody *really* needs anchors and I kinda like annoying people.\r\n\r\n@kchibisov You proposed this a while ago on IRC, do you think this is a bad idea?\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1217 for prior discussions.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6592/reactions","total_count":68,"+1":25,"-1":35,"laugh":7,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6592/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
