That's because Alacritty does not specify the input is for a terminal. In wayland, this can be done by [set_content_type](https://docs.rs/wayland-protocols/latest/wayland_protocols/wp/text_input/zv3/client/zwp_text_input_v3/struct.ZwpTextInputV3.html#method.set_content_type) to [ContentPurpose::Terminal](https://docs.rs/wayland-protocols/latest/wayland_protocols/wp/text_input/zv3/client/zwp_text_input_v3/enum.ContentPurpose.html#variant.Terminal).\r\n\r\nThe difficulty here is that ZwpTextInputV3 is handled by winit (in https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/blob/master/src/platform_impl/linux/wayland/seat/text_input/mod.rs), so winit needs to add an IME purpose too (not specific to Wayland). I think this would be reasonable (although support in the other platform impls would be limited, macos at least [supports some](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nstextcontenttype)). Alternatively, Alacritty would have to do IME handling manually on Wayland.","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6644/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6644/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
