was previously mentioned in https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/113#issuecomment-298948392 by a now-deleted user but seems to have been lost in the noise, so I thought I'd write it up properly.)\r\n\r\nThere is a patch for st called [externalpipe](https://st.suckless.org/patches/externalpipe/). It allows you to bind shortcut keys for piping the text from the terminal's screen to arbitrary external programs. I would very much like to have this functionality available in Alacritty.\r\n\r\nThe example there uses it as a workaround for URL recognition (#113) by piping to an external URL recognizer and calling `dmenu` to select among the options. I find this quite convenient, using the `urifind` tool from http://metacpan.org/pod/URI::Find. One could also use other tools to implement different kinds of pattern matching, thereby solving the use cases mentioned by @casey in https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/113#issuecomment-298079977 and https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/113#issuecomment-298081114. The main difference being that this would be a keyboard-driven instead of a mouse-driven interface.\r\n\r\nIn the end I would expect a configuration interface like the following in `key_bindings` (approximating what @casey's examples might look like using `dmenu` to pick among the matches visible on-screen):\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nkey_bindings:\r\n  - { key: F, mods: Control, externalpipe: { program: \"sh\", args: [\"-c\", \"rg -o 'https://[^\\\\s]+' | dmenu | xargs firefox\"] } }\r\n  - { key: I, mods: Control, externalpipe: { program: \"sh\", args: [\"-c\", \"rg -o '[-_0-9a-zA-Z/]+:[0-9]+' | dmenu | parallel -d: 'some-ide {1} --line {2}'\"] } }\r\n  - { key: G, mods: Control, externalpipe: { program: \"sh\", args: [\"-c\", \"rg -o '#[0-9]+' | dmenu | xargs -i firefox https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/{}\"] } }\r\n  - { key: G, mods: Control|Shift, externalpipe: { program: \"sh\", args: [\"-c\", \"rg -o '[a-f0-9]{40}' | dmenu | xargs -i firefox https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/commit/{}\"] } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems like a simpler way of approaching URL recognition and similar issues, since with this approach Alacritty doesn't have to concern itself with performing the pattern matching, only providing a straightforward data dump. It may be a relatively quick way of having a solution that is good enough for a lot of people.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1615/reactions","total_count":39,"+1":35,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1615/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-02T17:33:40Z","updated_at":"2020-03-02T17:33:40Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3408","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3408/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3408/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3408/events","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3408","id":574124716,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NzQxMjQ3MTY=","number":3408,"title":"Configurable

Each line looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2575f3d4 ch12345 Git comment starts here\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to click on `ch12345` to open it within a URL like: `https://app.clubhouse.io/story/12345`\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nRe implement the URL detection feature to accept one or more regex patterns.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n#### Attempt 1\r\n\r\nMake my script detect the `[cC][hH]([0-9]+)` pattern and emit OSC 8 hyperlinks within each line.\r\n\r\nThough this works just fine with kitty alone, when the script pipes git output to `fzf --ansi`, the latter eats up all hyperlinks as the give option does not go beyond processing ansi escapes.\r\n\r\n> Someone opened a similar bug on `fzf` more than 6 months ago; however, this issue has not been resolved to date.\r\n\r\n#### Attempt 2\r\nMy next attempt was to add the following line to `kitty.conf`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmap kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program kitty-open-helper.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\nif [[ \"$1\" =~ [cC][hH]([0-9]+) ]]; then\r\n  xdg-open https://app.clubhouse.io/story/${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\r\nelse\r\n  exec \"$@\"\r\nfi\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the UX is a bit awkward: rather than simply reaching for the text and clicking it, I have to first double-click to select it and then CTRL+SHIFT+O to open it.  (One more keyboard shortcut to remember.)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if I could simply reach out and click the `ch12345` text without having to select it first.\r\n\r\n#### Attempt 3\r\n\r\nImplement the approach as described within the [Hints](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/hints.html) section.\r\n\r\nThis would work, but is different than the mouse based solution I am trying to come up with.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/3821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/3821/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
