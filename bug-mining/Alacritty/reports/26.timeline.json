the definition of the somewhat unusual phrase \"dead key\", see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_key\r\n\r\nI didn't know until looking it up a few minutes ago, but a dead key is one which does not produce a character itself, but combines with the next character pressed. In macOS `option-e` is a dead key that combines with vowels to give them an acute accent: `option-e + o = ó`\r\n\r\nAnyways, long story short, alacritty hangs on macOS when any dead key is pressed. It doesn't crash, since the process doesn't exit, but the window freezes and ignores input. I tried option + `e`, `u`, `i`, `n`, and backtick, and they all crashed.\r\n\r\nI ran it under lldb, `ctrl-c`-ed after doing it to get to the debugger prompt, and captured this backtrace:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/casey/7eb6c2d967da370f106a8d8c5d9761d6\r\n\r\nIt appears to be waiting for an event which never comes. Kind of sad, really :'–(\r\n\r\n(Mach ports and messages are the low-level kernel provided mechanism through which much IPC happens on macOS.)\r\n\r\nAlso of note is that this happens when you press `command-control-space`, which opens the emoji keyboard on macOS. I captured a stack trace for this, and it appears to be identical.\r\n\r\nObviously, emoji keyboard functionality is of near paramount importance, since without it it is very difficult to include cute emoji in my git commit messages.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/280528463","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/211#issuecomment-280528463","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/211","id":280528463,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDUyODQ2Mw==","user":{"login":"michelboaventura","id":111037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTAzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura","html_url":"https://github.com/michelboaventura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michelboaventura/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-17T02:10:28Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T02:10:28Z","body":"@jwilm, I think I found the problem.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://github.com/jwilm/glutin/blob/master/src/api/x11/input.rs#L134) glutin is calling ``XFilterEvent`` but is ignoring its result. Xlib [doc](https://www.x.org/archive/current/doc/man/man3/XFilterEvent.3.xhtml) says:\r\n\r\n> If XFilterEvent returns True, then some input method has filtered the event, and the client should discard the event. If XFilterEvent returns False, then the client should continue processing the event.\r\n\r\nSo I moved the call to outside the ``if`` and did:\r\n```Rust\r\nlet raw_ev: *mut ffi::XKeyEvent = event;\r\nlet filter = unsafe { (self.display.xlib.XFilterEvent)(mem::transmute(raw_ev), self.window) };\r\n\r\nif filter == 1 {\r\n    return translated_events;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this fixed the issue for me \\o/\r\n\r\nI also found another issue which apparently is not causing any issue right now. If you look [here](https://github.com/jwilm/glutin/blob/master/src/api/x11/window.rs#L232) you will see that the code calls ``translate_key_event`` (which calls  ``Xutf8LookupString``) with both ``KeyPress`` and ``KeyRelease``, but according to [doc](https://www.x.org/archive//current/doc/man/man3/XmbLookupString.3.xhtml): \r\n\r\n> To ensure proper input processing, it is essential that the client pass only KeyPress events to XmbLookupString, XwcLookupString and Xutf8LookupString. Their behavior when a client passes a KeyRelease event is undefined.\r\n\r\nSo I remove the ``KeyRelease`` and things still work. And since ``translate_key_event`` is only being called with ``KeyPress`` its code can be simplified a bit.\r\n\r\nI didn't send you a PR because this changes are on Glutin and we are using a specific commit from
