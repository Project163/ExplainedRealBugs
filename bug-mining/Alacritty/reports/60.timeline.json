were two bugs fixed in this commit:\r\n\r\n1. `sgr_mouse_report` was not always called when `SGR_MOUSE` bit was set\r\n   due to calling `normal_mouse_report` instead of `mouse_report` in the\r\n   scrolling method.\r\n2. SGR reporting was always going off the left mouse button state rather\r\n   than what was appropriate. This affected SGR scroll reporting since\r\n   it only behaves correctly for pressed events (final character 'M').\r\n\r\nResolves
