title is hopefully descriptive enough. \r\n\r\nAn [identical feature request](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1526) for `alacritty` was implemented sometime ago: \r\n\r\n>A lot of other terminals (terminator, iTerm2, konsole, hyper, ...) set the COLORTERM environment variable to truecolor to indicate that the terminal supports it (see https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728 for more details).\r\n>\r\n>It is not a really great solution (it can fail if you start a terminal from another terminal, for example), but apparently there is currently no other standard.\r\n>\r\n>I would therefore propose that alacritty sets COLORTERM=truecolor in order for application developers to detect whether or not the terminal supports it.\r\n\r\nSee this [commit](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/commit/35ea0cded20aac5fa40859a22b95979d15018c51) which implements this for `alacritty`. Another example for qterminal is [here](https://github.com/lxqt/qterminal/issues/595).\r\n\r\nWezterm users have to currently hardcode this environment variable & value string in their `config.lua` file. See [this example config](https://github.com/wez/wezterm/issues/292) in an issues filed in this repo. This shouldn't be necessary at all since Wezterm is capable of 24-bit colors, it should proudly advertise it (and leave it up to various programs to use or discard it).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wezterm/wezterm/issues/875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wezterm/wezterm/issues/875/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"burneystarke","id":16246729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjQ2NzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16246729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/burneystarke","html_url":"https://github.com/burneystarke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burneystarke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burneystarke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burneystarke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burneystarke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burneystarke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burneystarke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burneystarke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burneystarke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/burneystarke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-02T17:59:53Z","updated_at":"2025-04-02T17:59:53Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/2090","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wavetermdev/waveterm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/2090/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/2090/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/2090/events","html_url":"https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/issues/2090","id":2967156911,"node_id":"I_kwDOHd1Zkc6w2ziv","number":2090,"title":"[Feature]:
