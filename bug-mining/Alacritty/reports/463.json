I'm currently using a couple of laptops from 2007-2008: a ThinkPad T43 and a ThinkPad T60. Unfortunately the Rust nightly you're currently using is broken on i686 (#126) so I can't test Alacritty on the T43, but it reported the error in the title on my T60 (which has a slightly better GPU, FWIW).\r\n\r\nT43 specs:\r\n```\r\nOpenGL vendor string: X.Org R300 Project\r\nOpenGL renderer string: Gallium 0.4 on ATI RV370\r\nOpenGL version string: 2.1 Mesa 11.0.2\r\nOpenGL shading language version string: 1.20\r\n\r\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: AMD/ATI [Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.] RV370/M22 [Mobility Radeon X300]\r\n```\r\n\r\nT60 specs:\r\n```\r\nExtended renderer info (GLX_MESA_query_renderer):\r\n    Vendor: X.Org R300 Project (0x1002)\r\n    Device: ATI RV515 (0x7145)\r\n    Version: 11.2.2\r\n    Accelerated: yes\r\n    Video memory: 128MB\r\n\r\n01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
