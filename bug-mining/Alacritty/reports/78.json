This leads to incorrect behavior not causing a test failure.\r\n\r\nTo make sure it's possible to write tests that also check the state of the scrollback history, not only the content of the current viewport, this should be reworked.\r\n\r\nTo keep backwards-compatibility with old ref-tests there probably needs to be a way to check what the specific history size for a ref-test should be, this can be solved by adding a `history_size` field to the grid which is already done in #1245","closed_by":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
