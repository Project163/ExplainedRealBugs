bug reports, the following information can help speed up the process. Please\r\ndescribe the bug that you have found and what you would expect to happen\r\ninstead.\r\n\r\nI have set up a hook in hyprland to enable/disable the internal monitor of my laptop on lid open/close if there\r\nis an external monitor connected. This essentially removes the monitor from layout and will\r\nmove workspaces to other monitors. Alacritty crashes every time I close the lid.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the Alacritty window is not on the monitor to be disabled, it is on the external\r\nmonitor instead. I have also verified that Kitty would not crash in such cases.\r\n\r\nThe following log is obtained:\r\n```\r\nthread 'main' panicked at /build/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/smithay-client-toolkit-0.18.1/src/output.rs:425:14:\r\nReceived event for dead output\r\nstack backtrace:\r\n   0:     0x631f3175e70b - <unknown>\r\n   1:     0x631f3162bdd0 - <unknown>\r\n   2:     0x631f3175a782 - <unknown>\r\n   3:     0x631f3175e4a4 - <unknown>\r\n   4:     0x631f3175fe30 - <unknown>\r\n   5:     0x631f3175fb4f - <unknown>\r\n   6:     0x631f3176034e - <unknown>\r\n   7:     0x631f31760252 - <unknown>\r\n   8:     0x631f3175ec06 - <unknown>\r\n   9:     0x631f3175ffb4 - <unknown>\r\n  10:     0x631f31371855 - <unknown>\r\n  11:     0x631f31371813 - <unknown>\r\n  12:     0x631f318b781a - <unknown>\r\n  13:     0x631f3184b6f9 - <unknown>\r\n  14:     0x631f31432cce - <unknown>\r\n  15:     0x631f31552481 - <unknown>\r\n  16:     0x631f314fed19 - <unknown>\r\n  17:     0x631f3144fcf0 - <unknown>\r\n  18:     0x631f31511b86 - <unknown>\r\n  19:     0x631f31515a2b - <unknown>\r\n  20:     0x631f31580edd - <unknown>\r\n  21:     0x631f313b42f3 - <unknown>\r\n  22:     0x631f314f2589 - <unknown>\r\n  23:     0x631f31752e45 - <unknown>\r\n  24:     0x631f3158275c - <unknown>\r\n  25:     0x74a54ed1cc88 - <unknown>\r\n  26:     0x74a54ed1cd4c - __libc_start_main\r\n  27:     0x631f3138ac05 - <unknown>\r\n  28:                0x0 - <unknown>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System\r\n\r\nOS: Arch Linux\r\nVersion: alacritty 0.13.2 (bb8ea18e)\r\nLinux/BSD: Wayland, hyprland\r\n\r\n### Logs\r\n\r\nCrashes: STDERR, STDOUT\r\nFont/Terminal size: `alacritty -vv`\r\nKeyboard and bindings: `alacritty --print-events`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/8049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/8049/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
