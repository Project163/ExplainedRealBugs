One would have to test iTerm first to see if we could adapt that to work in Alacritty though. But even then, the Rust STD API does not allow for this hackery since it's in no way how things are intended to work, so one would likely have to rely on some lower level unsafe platform APIs and the output of `who` just doesn't matter enough to me to look into that.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is interested in trying to fix this, a PR would obviously be very welcome and the original PR should basically tell you everything you need to know. But I don't see myself fixing this anytime soon.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/595876388/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3106228363,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMxMDYyMjgzNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3106228363","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-06T17:30:15Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3106228365,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMxMDYyMjgzNjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3106228365","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-06T17:30:15Z","label":{"name":"help

`-` is not sufficient to be\r\nregistered as a login session for things like `w` and `logname`.\r\nHowever, using the `login` command changes the directory to `$HOME`\r\nbefore running the program by default, which is not desired. The `-l`\r\nflag disables this behavior, but also skips prepending `-` to the\r\nexecuted program, so shells will not run as login shells. Instead we\r\njust do this part ourselves with `exec -a`. The result is login shells\r\nthat run in the intended directory and are registered as tty sessions.\r\n\r\nUpdate `alacritty.yml` to reflect that Alacritty will use `$SHELL` or\r\nthe user's login shell on Linux, BSD, and macOS.\r\n\r\nFixes
