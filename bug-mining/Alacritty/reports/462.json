Well done.\r\n\r\nI followed #5837 and about 10 days [I commented, in the PR,](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/5837#issuecomment-1025443843)  how happy I was with the actual rendered undercurls on my system as seen in this image (look great to my eye):\r\n\r\n![undercurl1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11382509/153320903-28dc6928-fb17-4774-9dd2-cfe0e5ec3bb9.png)\r\n\r\nI just built master and undercurls are now much thicker (and too strong imo), compare above with this:\r\n\r\n![undercurl2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11382509/153320993-ad6fdf85-ab89-4c0d-8f97-359df9172d60.png)\r\n\r\nTo compare again, here is what underlines look like:\r\n\r\n![Underline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11382509/153321028-255180bf-cefd-497c-80f6-fff1c2892dc1.png)\r\n\r\nThere was a definite rendering change to undercurls between image 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nAlso notice that image 1 has downward curling ends whilst image 2 (master) was upward angling curls at the ends. Eye of the beholder, I can go either way.\r\n\r\nBut is there anything that can be done about the thickness? Thinning it out a bit?\r\n\r\nBest regards.","closed_by":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5873/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
