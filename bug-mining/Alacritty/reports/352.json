The line number is set to be 1 via either the `window/dimensions/lines` option in the config file or the `--dimensions` command line option.\r\n2. The position is set to be a non-default value via either the `window/position` options or the `--position` command line option.\r\n3. More than one lines have been printed to the terminal.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to reproduce this by doing the following:\r\n```\r\nalacritty --dimensions 20 1 --position 1 0 -e ./a.sh\r\n```\r\n`./a.sh`:\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\nprintf \"123\\n456\\n789\"\r\nsleep 10\r\n```\r\nOne would expect `789` to be shown in the terminal window, but what's actually shown is `456`.\r\n\r\nOS: Arch Linux\r\nVersion: 0.5.0 (and 0.4.3 does not have this issue)\r\nLinux/BSD: X11, bspwm\r\n\r\nI think this is probably caused by this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/1bf40a8cc77d9082dfb76e028e0f66af88d79958/alacritty_terminal/src/term/mod.rs#L44\r\n\r\nFor some reasons, the minimal column/line number of the internal representation of the terminal (`Term`) is set to be 2.\r\n\r\nThis minimum size is not considered when a `Term` is constructed, but only used when it's resized. Actually except for `Term<_>::resize` I don't think this limit is used anywhere. I think the reason why this problem only occurs when a non-default position is set is probably because of this: I assume setting the position will trigger an \"update\", and the \"update\" will cause the `Term` to resize, even to its original size.\r\n\r\nI think this can be fixed simply by stop using the minimum size. I can create a PR myself for that. Is there a reason why we want the minimum terminal size to be 2?","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4207/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/4207/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
