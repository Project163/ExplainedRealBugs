a new \"Quit\" action and binds it to Cmd-W and Cmd-Q on Mac OS in an\r\nattempt to make Alacritty feel more like a \"normal\" citizen of the\r\noperating system. Alternatives like Ctrl-D are okay, but I usually want\r\nto leave my shells nested within Tmux open even if I exit my terminal.\r\nIt's also largely selfish: I've built up muscle memory over the years\r\nthat takes my fingers to Cmd-Q first (and I suspect I'm not the only\r\none).\r\n\r\nThe implementation for an exit is copied from `event.rs` which notably\r\nis already tagged with a FIXME. It seems that `tty.rs` contains a\r\n`process_should_exit` system to help handle a `SIGCHLD`, and it's\r\npossible that these two exit implementations should be merged together.\r\nI could probably tackle that as my next project.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in #218, Alacritty can't really spawn other windows right\r\nnow, so I've tied in Cmd-W as simply another synonym for quitting until\r\nthat's implemented.\r\n\r\nOne other thought: I'm not super convinced on the approach of having all\r\nkey bindings configured directly from a Yaml file and without any\r\ndefaults. You can see that even here it will be a bit of a problem\r\nbecause there may be hundreds of Mac users out there who won't get this\r\nkey binding until they port it in manually or bootstrap from a fresh\r\nversion of the repository's default configuration file.\r\n\r\nFixes #218.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/393/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/277574977","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/218#issuecomment-277574977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/218","id":277574977,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzU3NDk3Nw==","user":{"login":"brandur","id":96890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2ODkw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur","html_url":"https://github.com/brandur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brandur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-06T02:46:17Z","updated_at":"2017-02-06T02:46:17Z","body":"> Cmd-W is essentially going to be equivalent to Cmd-Q at this point since each Alacritty is a process leader.\r\n\r\nI think that would be fine until there are actually windows to be closed individually.\r\n\r\n> Cmd-N I was planning to implement very generally -- just making it possible through config.
