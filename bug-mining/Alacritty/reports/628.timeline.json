VT100 doesn't actually save the origin mode\n\nYes it does. Later models used a slightly different algorithm, but they all save and restore origin mode.\n\nAs @BlackAsLight pointed out, if you don't restore the mode, you can end up with the cursor position out of bounds, potentially with negative coordinates. Although that's less of a problem for Alacritty, because it doesn't respect origin mode when reporting the position, so the coordinates are just incorrect, but at least still valid

I just wanted you to be aware that it is actually a bug, and you're not matching the VT100 behavior.\n\nYeah that's fair, I'd happily change that if it ever causes any issues. However since most of Alacritty's terminal emulation was based off URxvt, I'm going to keep it as-is until it causes problems.
