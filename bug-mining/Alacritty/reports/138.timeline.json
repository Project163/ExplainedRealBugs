default shift+pgup/pgdown buttons were sending the escape sequences\r\nspecified by the official standard, however most terminal emulators like\r\nXTerm, URxvt and VTE make an exception for this special case and instead\r\nscroll the native history buffer.\r\n\r\nBoth XTerm and URxvt do never send the escapes for Shift+PgUp/PgDown,\r\nhowever VTE does send them in the alternate screen.\r\n\r\nSince Alacritty already supports keybindings based on terminal mode and\r\nthe binding to scroll the history is useless when in the alternate\r\nscreen buffer, Alacritty is now following VTEs behavior here, allowing\r\napplications in the alt screen (like vim) to handle this escape.\r\n\r\nFixes
