time.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1168191839/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"cdelledonne","id":24732205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzMyMjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24732205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdelledonne","html_url":"https://github.com/cdelledonne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdelledonne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdelledonne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdelledonne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdelledonne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdelledonne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdelledonne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdelledonne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdelledonne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdelledonne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-03T13:57:03Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T13:57:03Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninja-build/ninja/issues/2209","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninja-build/ninja","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninja-build/ninja/issues/2209/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninja-build/ninja/issues/2209/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninja-build/ninja/issues/2209/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/issues/2209","id":1434707637,"node_id":"I_kwDOABRfXM5Vg-a1","number":2209,"title":"Erase

\"smart terminals\", Ninja uses the ANSI code `\\x1B[K` (EL) to erase from the cursor to the end of line, so as to clean whatever was left from the previous line of output:\r\nhttps://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/blob/91f99ab60747e76eca5222c74531268a5d55acf1/src/line_printer.cc#L109-L115\r\n\r\nWhen the current line of output is just as long as the width of the terminal (which happens with all elided lines), the last character of the line gets overwritten by the EL code. This behavior actually depends on the implementation of the terminal. However, as hinted in this related issue https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6159, this seems like the intended behavior for terminals that comply with the standard mentioned in that issue.\r\n\r\nTo observe this effect in e.g. XTerm, one can run the following command, which should result in a `>` character at the end of the first line, but such character is overwritten by the EL code:\r\n```bash\r\nprintf '-%.0s' {1..$(($COLUMNS-1))} ; printf '>' ; printf '\\e[K' ; printf '\\r\\nSecond line\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nApparently, according to the standard mentioned in the linked issue, when a character is printed on the last column of the terminal (`>` in the command above), the column index is not incremented, and thus the EL code ends up overwriting that last character.\r\n\r\nCould a solution be implemented in Ninja? For instance, send the EL code at the beginning of the line as opposed to at the end:\r\n```cpp\r\nwinsize size;\r\nif ((ioctl(STDOUT_FILENO, TIOCGWINSZ, &size) == 0) && size.ws_col) {\r\n  to_print = ElideMiddle(to_print, size.ws_col);\r\n}\r\nprintf(\"\\x1B[K\");  // Clear to end of line.\r\nprintf(\"%s\", to_print.c_str());\r\nfflush(stdout);\r\n```\r\nor only send the EL code if the line is shorter than the width of the terminal:\r\n```cpp\r\nwinsize size;\r\nif ((ioctl(STDOUT_FILENO, TIOCGWINSZ, &size) == 0) && size.ws_col) {\r\n  to_print = ElideMiddle(to_print, size.ws_col);\r\n}\r\nprintf(\"%s\", to_print.c_str());\r\nif (to_print.size() < size.ws_col) {\r\n  printf(\"\\x1B[K\");  // Clear to end of line.\r\n}\r\nfflush(stdout);\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninja-build/ninja/issues/2209/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ninja-build/ninja/issues/2209/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"j4james","id":4181424,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODE0MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4181424?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j4james","html_url":"https://github.com/j4james","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j4james/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j4james/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j4james/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j4james/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j4james/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j4james/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j4james/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j4james/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j4james/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-19T11:03:08Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T11:03:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6513","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6513/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6513/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6513/events","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6513","id":1456172946,"node_id":"I_kwDOAxkop85Wy2-S","number":6513,"title":"ANSI

Generally I was curious if terminals that ignored the clear right would clear the newline flag and I got some curious results.\r\n\r\nKitty has the most sensible behavior I think. `\\e[0K` is ignored after the last column, `\\e[1K` and `\\e[2K` just clear the first line completely and still put the `b` in the second line.\r\n\r\nVTE seems kinda broken to me. `\\e[0K` is also ignored after the last column, but `\\e[1K` clears the newline flag putting the `b` in the last column of the first line while `\\e[2K` doesn't and puts the `b` in the next line.

`\\e[1K`.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1383268488/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8230599290,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAxkop85MmRIczwAAAAHqlPp6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/8230599290","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"efce55ab545284a18ff0e974a4f4b5e987542e23","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chrisduerr/alacritty/commits/efce55ab545284a18ff0e974a4f4b5e987542e23","created_at":"2023-01-15T22:31:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-15T22:31:29Z","updated_at":"2023-01-15T22:31:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6624","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6624/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6624/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/6624/events","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/6624","id":1534032411,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAxkop85HazUj","number":6624,"title":"Preserve
