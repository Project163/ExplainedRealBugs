With other terminal emulators when I want a new terminal instance, I simply open a new window. As far as I can tell, the only way to accomplish this with Alacritty is to open a new instance of the application. This is inferior for three reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Load times when opening a new instance of Alacritty are subpar. For a program that prides itself on being the fastest, opening new terminals should be no exception. (Loading a new instance of Alacritty lasts about 1 second for me vs instant when opening a new window in iTerm.)\r\n\r\n2. On macOS opening multiple instances of Alacritty fills up the Dock and Application Switcher.\r\n\r\n3. Currently, such behavior must be implemented manually by the user.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell from other issues, using window managers as a replacement for tmux is within Alacritty's scope. Even when using tmux, it can be desirable to open a second tmux instance for an unrelated session without detaching from the current session. I think multiple windows should be supported natively by Alacritty.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/607/reactions","total_count":528,"+1":490,"-1":12,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":25,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/607/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
