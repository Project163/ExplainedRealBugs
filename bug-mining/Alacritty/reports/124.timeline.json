Adding a special heuristic which removes trailing `.` or `,` sounds like a good improvement.\r\n\r\nThis should also be an extremely simple change. The only thing left to figure out is if repeated trailing `.` or `,` should be stripped (should `test https://example.com/... it's nice`) ignore all three `.`s or just the last one? Now `...` is a special occasion, but something like `,.,..,` might be an example that's less common where this question isn't that easy to answer.\r\n\r\nI'd personally recommend just stripping all trailing `.` or `,` with infinite repetition because I think that this would provide the best result with the least amount of work, but I'm open to other idea.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/436270673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1949080533,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5NDkwODA1MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1949080533","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-06T14:27:25Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1949080541,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5NDkwODA1NDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1949080541","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-11-06T14:27:25Z","label":{"name":"help

the initial version of URL detection had some issues with being a\r\nbit over-eager to mark things as URLs, a different approach has been\r\ntaken instead.\r\n\r\nTo make parsing easier, instead of trying to detect the URL by using a\r\nstreaming parser to the left and right of the click position, the\r\ncomplete buffer is now converted to a string and then searched for\r\nlinks.\r\n\r\nWith this change, it was made possible to use the `linkify` library\r\nwhich handles locating the URLs in the terminal buffer text. Since it\r\nnow automatically finds all present URLs, this also brings us a step\r\ncloser to #1618.\r\n\r\nFixes #1903.\r\nFixes #1753.\r\nFixes
