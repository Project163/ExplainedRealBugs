Your notation was a bit confusing. Though I don't think I'd ever want to allow anything beyond 1.0.\r\n\r\nMy notation is a multiplier to our default percent, so in this notation range of `0.5 - 2` will allow Beam cursor width from `7.5%` of the cell, up to `30%` of the cell, since our cursor width is `15%` by default. \r\n\r\n>The only thing that we might want to change is the thickness of the cursor.\r\n\r\nI agree here, let's focus on thickness, I really don't see a good benefit from a bit higher cursor, especially, that your cursor is higher than everything else by default for a normal characters. I'll also would propose generic cursor thickness for both underline and I-Beam cursors, like we have right now hard coded `15%` value, however one could want different thicknesses for both cursors(e.g. I'm fine with default thickness for Underline cursor on my system, but want a bit thicker beam cursor for vim).\r\n\r\nI wonder if `(2 * thickness_of_underline).round()` will work though, but some fonts could have very strange underline metrics(extra thin), so I'm not sure that we should change approach with percent of the cell width.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/607387394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/607756101","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3526#issuecomment-607756101","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3526","id":607756101,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwNzc1NjEwMQ==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-02T10:19:33Z","updated_at":"2020-04-02T10:19:33Z","body":"> My notation is a multiplier to our default percent, so in this notation range of 0.5 - 2 will allow Beam cursor width from 7.5% of the cell, up to 30% of the cell, since our cursor width is 15% by default.\r\n\r\nThat just sounds more complicated than it needs to be tbh.\r\n\r\n>  I'll also would propose generic cursor thickness for both underline and I-Beam cursors, like we have right now hard coded 15% value, however one could want different thicknesses for both cursors(e.g. I'm fine with default thickness for Underline cursor on my system, but want a bit thicker beam cursor for vim).\r\n\r\nI think one thickness option would be more than enough.
