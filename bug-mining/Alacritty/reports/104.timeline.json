would be interesting to implement this by allowing the user to supply a series of rules consisting of a pattern and an action.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nrules:\r\n  'https://[^\\s]+': firefox {0}\r\n  '([-_0-9a-zA-Z/]+):([0-9]+)': some-ide {1} --line {2}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe key for a rule is a regex to match under the cursor, and the value of the rule shows the command line to run when it matches, with {N} representing capture groups of the matched regex to substitute into the command.\r\n\r\nThis is roughly how the the Plan 9 plumber works, so no credit due to me for this
