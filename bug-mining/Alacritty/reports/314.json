This is done because a terminal has two grids at all times, one containing the currently active content and the other containing either the alternate grid if the alternate screen is not active, or the primary grid if it is.\r\n\r\nNaming this variable `alt_grid` is very unfortunate, since it seems to indicate that this is always the alternate screen, which is not true. The same can be said about `cursor_save_alt`.\r\n\r\nSince this has caused at least two bugs in the past, these variables should be renamed. One option that comes to mind would be `inactive_grid`. Renaming the primary grid would also be an option, however I think it's best to keep that short and concise.","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3504/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
