text-based overlay; to prevent obstruction it should move from right/left or top/bottom when the vi cursor is moved to its location\r\n\r\nI do like that approach more, since you can have some sort of scrollback position information in it. In general, such overlay should be timer based and appear only under certain circumstances.\r\n\r\n>1px colored border around the terminal, obstructing content if there is no padding available/configured\r\n\r\nNot sure that I like it, and 1px isn't something that noticeable on high density or poor quality panels. Even if you make it larger, I don't like the esthetics of that approach.\r\n\r\n>Alternative background color\r\n\r\nNah, I'm not sure that it'll work in alt-screen with truecolored applications, since they just render random colors over background. So you should just write your random color for all visible background cells, which sounds not fun.\r\n\r\n>Bar with text indicator, shrinking the terminal height permanently; in theory this would allow starting search without having to resize in vi mode\r\n\r\nNot entirely bad, but not that I really like it either. Especially knowing that we have infra infrastructure to do that in place.\r\n\r\nSo, it'll either be a timer based overlay that hides/shows under certain heuristics or stays permanently, but jumps around, or permanent search bar at the bottom. We already have all the code in place to just use both solution though, so it's just a matter of preference.\r\n\r\nI do prefer overlay a bit more, since you can always hide it without shifting things around.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/660712757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/660713024","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3984#issuecomment-660713024","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3984","id":660713024,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MDcxMzAyNA==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-19T21:32:12Z","updated_at":"2020-07-19T21:33:19Z","body":"> In general, such overlay should be timer based\r\n\r\nHaving an overlay go away after a certain amount of time would completely defeat the purpose of using it as a better visual feedback for vi mode.\r\n\r\nOne thing with an overlay is that it would be additive to search, while a bar would be reused for search.

Just a thought, since I think I'm in favor of it's current position.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/663911487/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nixpulvis","id":715947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTk0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/715947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis","html_url":"https://github.com/nixpulvis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/663913488","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3984#issuecomment-663913488","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3984","id":663913488,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2MzkxMzQ4OA==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-25T22:44:19Z","updated_at":"2020-07-25T22:44:19Z","body":"> If we put the status on the top, the text could remain in place\r\n\r\nThat is not correct.

So take my opinion with a grain of salt ;)\r\n\r\nThe current ability to configure the cursor in Vi mode is a good interim solution. However, this issue will definitely improve usability. So I do welcome this enhancement.\r\n\r\nThese four choice were provided by @chrisduerr:\r\n\r\n> * 1px colored border around the terminal, obstructing content if there is no padding available/configured\r\n\r\nI do not favour this aesthetically; whilst I also note that some Linux window managers highlight the border of the active window. So on some systems it may look unpleasant to have the border highlighted by the window manager **and** have Alacritty highlight the inner border whilst in Vi mode.\r\n\r\n> * Short, text-based overlay; to prevent obstruction it should move from right/left or top/bottom when the vi cursor is moved to its location\r\n\r\n**Yes**, I like this a lot. tmux uses such a scheme (top-right corner) when one is in copy-mode. And, too an extent Vim also does something similar in the command area when in `--insert--` mode.\r\n\r\n> * Bar with text indicator, shrinking the terminal height permanently; in theory this would allow starting search without having to resize in vi mode\r\n\r\nThis loses quite a bit of screen real-estate for an information indicator. Not in favour of this.\r\n\r\n> * Alternative background color\r\n\r\nLike the above bar option, this one also seems too heavy handed.\r\n\r\nShort text overlay is my strong preference. Ideally, for me, I'd like it in a fixed location, not auto-placed and potentially hard to find. Lower right corner, one line up would be my ideal (taking into account Zsh users with right-hand side prompts).\r\n\r\nMy 2cents, best regards.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/665394505/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluz71","id":11382509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzgyNTA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11382509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71","html_url":"https://github.com/bluz71","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluz71/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3596993502,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzU5Njk5MzUwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3596993502","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-29T02:30:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3596993503,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM1OTY5OTM1MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/3596993503","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-29T02:30:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/665731321","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3984#issuecomment-665731321","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3984","id":665731321,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2NTczMTMyMQ==","user":{"login":"nixpulvis","id":715947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNTk0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/715947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis","html_url":"https://github.com/nixpulvis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nixpulvis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-29T15:24:30Z","updated_at":"
