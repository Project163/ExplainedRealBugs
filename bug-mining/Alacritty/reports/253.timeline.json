course!\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the required winit APIs to modify Window minimized state should be these:\r\nhttps://docs.rs/winit/0.19.1/winit/struct.Window.html#method.show\r\nhttps://docs.rs/winit/0.19.1/winit/struct.Window.html#method.hide\r\n\r\nThese probably need to be exposed on the `alacritty_terminar/src/window.rs` first. I think a `hide` method already exists, not sure about showing.\r\n\r\nThen to hook it all up, the config.yml documentation and the input handling need to be modified. A good reference would be the existing `ToggleFullscreen` and `ToggleSimpleFullscreen` bindings. Searching this repo should find all instances of them and just copying what they do should be fine.\r\n\r\nTo go into a bit more detail, you'd need to define an action [like this](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/blob/master/alacritty_terminal/src/input.rs#L258) and then bind that action to modify the window [like this](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/blob/master/alacritty_terminal/src/input.rs#L304-L306).\r\n\r\nThat should basically be it, let me know if you need any more info and I can get into a bit more detail.

The required method to perform `minimize` on `macOs` is [this one](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/1419426-miniaturize?language=objc) ([rust binding for it](https://github.com/servo/cocoa-rs/blob/ea0667fdd2cffbdc442e50bbf6a2977ba7c2d322/src/appkit.rs#L1018)), which is not used in `winit` anywhere. The `minimize` and `hide` actions are different on `macOs`, we already have binding and action for `Hide`, however adding proper `macOs` `minimize` support requires a patch to `winit`.\r\n\r\nThe patch to `winit` should be very simple, it's about calling mentioned methods on `NSWindow`.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can be wrong about it though.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/505652922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2439167579,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQzOTE2NzU3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/2439167579","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-25T22:57:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2439167580,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0MzkxNjc1ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/2439167580","actor":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-25T22:57:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/505654562","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2534#issuecomment-505654562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2534","id":505654562,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTY1NDU2Mg==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}

has been reported to Alacritty in https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty/issues/2534.\r\n\r\nCurrently winit exposes an API on all platforms to set the window visibility using the `set_visible` method. If this is called on macOS, the window is hidden without adding it to the dock, this is working as intended.\r\n\r\nHowever, on macOS a different method of hiding windows exists too, this is called `miniaturize` [in their docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nswindow/1419426-miniaturize?language=objc)  which makes the window invisible and adds it to the dock. I believe this is what happens when the minimize button is clicked in the window decorations, but as far as I can tell there's no way to call this explicitly from winit.\r\n\r\nThe generated cocoa-rs bindings provide [this method](https://github.com/servo/cocoa-rs/blob/ea0667fdd2cffbdc442e50bbf6a2977ba7c2d322/src/appkit.rs#L1018) on `NsWindow`. So I think it should be relatively trivial to implement this using the [`WindowsExtMacOS`](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/blob/master/src/platform/macos.rs#L12), since I don't think it's available in this fashion on any other platform.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, this could be declared as out of scope, so downstream consumers would have to use the [`ns_window`](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/blob/master/src/platform/macos.rs#L16) call instead to do this themselves.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/983/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-windowing/winit/issues/983/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/505656429","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2534#issuecomment-505656429","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/2534","id":505656429,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTY1NjQyOQ==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-25T23:14:41Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T23:14:41Z","body":"I've created an issue upstream: https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/issues/983\r\n\r\nLooking into this, it might be a good first issue for anyone interested in contributing to winit, assuming that the feature is accepted.
