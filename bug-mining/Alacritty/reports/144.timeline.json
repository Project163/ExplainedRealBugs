ctx with padding was being used to determine if the last mouse location was valid, however the padding doesn't need to be applied to mouse locations. Mouse x,y is updated by CursorMoved events which only send events if the mouse is inside of the alacritty window bounds.\r\n\r\nInstead, use usize::max_value() as a marker for invalid mouse positions and set to that value on CursorLeft events to ensure that mouse_coords() returns None when the mouse position is invalid. This should allow any mouse location inside the alacritty window to return a proper row/col coord.\r\n\r\nThis fixes
