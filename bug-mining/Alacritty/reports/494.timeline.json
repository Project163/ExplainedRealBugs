the problem is that font is not really an svg font, it has some svg glyphs in it, but not all of them. So for example with freetyp `2.11` this font has a normal height, but with the freetype `2.12` it's not, because now freetype detects `svg` glyphs inside of it and uses the height 1. If the font was purely made of svgs it would make some sense, but this particular one is not.\r\n\r\n>new behaviors that annoys you so much\r\n\r\nIt annoys me because this font works with freetype 2.11 and not with freetype 2.12 indicating that we need to add extra handling for freetype 2.12, but that handling won't be there for old versions of alacritty. It's not like I do care about old versions that much, I just don't like when something like that breaks.\r\n\r\n@yuqiancn \r\nThis particular font got patched to not contain them or something like that from what I remember and if you read through the issue #6048 you may notice that it got solved with a font update, since newer versions of the font don't have svg's in it.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/1288032276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kchibisov","id":27620401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjIwNDAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27620401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov","html_url":"https://github.com/kchibisov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kchibisov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7647831881,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAxkop85UizeVzwAAAAHH2KdJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/7647831881","actor":{"login":"apodtele","id":32550896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTUwODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32550896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele","html_url":"https://github.com/apodtele","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-23T07:07:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7647831891,"node_id":"SE_lADOAxkop85UizeVzwAAAAHH2KdT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/7647831891","actor":{"login":"apodtele","id":32550896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTUwODk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32550896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele","html_url":"https://github.com/apodtele","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apodtele/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-23T07:07:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7647831912,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAxkop85UizeVzwAAAAHH2Kdo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/7647831912","actor":{"login":"yuqiancn","id":32979107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTc5MTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32979107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqiancn","html_url":"https://github.com/yuqiancn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqiancn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqiancn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqiancn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqiancn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqiancn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqiancn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqiancn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqiancn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yuqiancn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-23T07:07:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7647831921,"node_id":"SE_lADOAxkop85UizeVzwAAAAHH2Kdx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/ev
