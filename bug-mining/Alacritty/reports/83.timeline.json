code 12 = [`XConfigureWindow`](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/proto/xproto/tree/Xproto.h#n2033). Since the DPR is infinite, and the window size Alacritty requests is presumably a function of that, X11 is asked to resize the window to something ridiculous, hence the ¨integer parameter out of range for operation¨. This is why I added that simplistic error logging, since as you can see, the line printed by `expect` is quite misleading; in future versions of winit I hope to automatically translate the request code to the relevant request name.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that `device_pixel_ratio` is a function of winit's `Window::hidpi_factor`, and that Alacritty resizes the window immediately after creation in response to this info. What math goes into `device_pixel_ratio`? Either way, this is likely some issue with how winit calculates DPI wrt XRandR's supplied data. @Tristan971 what's the output of `xrandr --listmonitors --verbose`? You could also tell me the output of this little winit program:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nextern crate winit;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let event_loop = winit::EventsLoop::new();\r\n    for monitor in event_loop.get_available_monitors() {\r\n        println!(\"{:#?}\", monitor);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe info about the winit examples isn't relevant. On X11, creating a window without drawing to it just populates it with a copy of whatever's behind it at the time of creation (Windows fills it with white, but any areas exposed by resizing are black, and on macOS it's transparent... this was just some fun trivia). Besides that, the winit examples just create windows of some default 800x600 physical size, so this couldn't happen there.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/393582731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"francesca64","id":2096580,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTY1ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2096580?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francesca64","html_url":"https://github.com/francesca64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francesca64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francesca64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francesca64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francesca64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francesca64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francesca64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francesca64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francesca64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francesca64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1656367499,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTY1NjM2NzQ5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1656367499","actor":{"login":"Tristan971","id":875533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTUzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/875533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971","html_url":"https://github.com/Tristan971","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-31T16:03:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1656367501,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2NTYzNjc1MDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/1656367501","actor":{"login":"Tristan971","id":875533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTUzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/875533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971","html_url":"https://github.com/Tristan971","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tristan971/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-31T16:03:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/393587558","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1341#issuecomment-393587558","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1341","id":393587558,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzU4NzU1OA==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"publi
