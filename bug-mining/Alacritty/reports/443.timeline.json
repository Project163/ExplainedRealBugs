NOTE: PLEASE FILL OUT TEMPLATE RATHER THAN DELETING --->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nInitial size of neovide's window is wrong on `kwin_wayland` (KDE's wayland compositor).\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the same issue Alacritty had: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5603\r\n\r\nI had the very same issue with alacritty, which got fixed by compiling from this PR: https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/pull/5650\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Use KDE wayland desktop session\r\n2. Start neovide\r\n3. Window doesn't show (wrong initial size)\r\n4. (optional/workaround) Since it's impossible to see and therefore resize the window with the mouse, using any resizing keyboard shortcut can force a resize and the window is visible, making it visible. In my case I use shortcuts to tile window to up/down/left/right of the screen, which I can use to place the window to any screen side and then move/resize the window manually\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nA visible, working, window from the start.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nInitial window (the pixels inside the red circle):\r\n\r\n![20211204-135530](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4762/144717799-ad3d84c3-1f6e-4abf-b6a6-0009d8a64c40.png)\r\n\r\nTask switcher (alt-tab) showing neovide's window and kitty terminal:\r\n\r\n![20211204-135347](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4762/144717828-140e734c-f42e-4bec-b6f1-4c044d77177e.png)\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n - OS: Fedora Linux 35 (KDE Plasma) x86_64\r\n - Neovide Version: master\r\n - Neovim Version: v0.5.1\r\n\r\n**Please run `neovide --log` and paste the contents of the `.log` file here:**\r\n\r\n[neovide_rCURRENT.log](https://github.com/neovide/neovide/files/7654292/neovide_rCURRENT.log)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be with wayland context initialization upstream (glutin or winit, not sure) and seems to be fixed in glutin 0.28.0 / winit 0.26.0.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovide/neovide/issues/1067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/neovide/neovide/issues/1067/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
