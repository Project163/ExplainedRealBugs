Instead, they should all be specified in the `alacritty.yml` file. Currently hardcoded keybindings should be added to the default `alacritty.yml` config.\n\nThere's a couple of binding types we need to support\n1. Given a key combination and terminal state, send an escape sequence.\n2. Given a key combination and terminal state, perform a predefined action\n   - Actions: `copy-selection`, `paste`, `toggle-fullscreen`\n\nI imagine the config might look something like this\n\n``` yml\nbindings:\n  - key: f11\n    escape: [23~\n  - key: enter\n    mods: super # super and cmd are interchangeable modifiers\n    action: full-screen\n  - mouse: 5\n    action: paste\n  - key: left arrow\n    mode: app-cursor\n    escape: OD\n```\n\nNotes on the above config:\n- `mods` defaults to no mods\n- `mode` defaults to any mode\n- keys like `left arrow` would be easy to screw up the identifier for. Better option there?\n- full-screen isn't current supported\n- clipboard stuff isn't currently supported\n\nOne thing that's nice about the current approach is bindings for each key are available in a static location. It would be nice to still be able to jump to the binding list for a given key using an array or Vec or `match` instead of going through a HashMap.\n\nI think the initial implementation of this will be supporting the current keybindings but defined from the config file instead of hard-coded.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jwilm","id":4285147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODUxNDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4285147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwilm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwilm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
