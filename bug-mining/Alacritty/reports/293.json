I'm not sure how the cursor is rendered and what scale could be applied, but some way of adjusting it should probably exist. In a discussion on irc @kchibisov said it'd be nice to have some sort of option to tune the style of the underline as well. \r\n\r\nA good solution would likely be a uniform way of tuning the different cursor styles, my proposed format for the configuration file is:\r\n```\r\ncursor:\r\n  style: [Block/Underline/Beam]\r\n  height: [\\dpx]\r\n  width: [\\dpx]\r\n\r\n  Underline:\r\n    height: [\\dpx]\r\n    width: [\\dpx] (inhibit from default)\r\n  Beam:\r\n    height: [\\dpx] (inhibit from default)\r\n    width: [\\dpx]\r\n  Box:\r\n    height: [\\dpx] (inhibit from default)\r\n    width: [\\dpx] (inhibit from default)\r\n    border_thickness: [\\dpx]\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/3526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
