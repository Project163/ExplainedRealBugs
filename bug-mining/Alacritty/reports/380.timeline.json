errors as mentioned [here](https://github.com/hecrj/iced/issues/386) #386, I followed the advice to install fontconfig (and libfontconfig1-dev) and those errors went away.  However one remained.  Here is the output I see when I try to `cargo run` the **tours** example.  \r\n\r\n> WARNING: radv is not a conformant vulkan implementation, testing use only.\r\n> [2021-04-08T18:15:59Z ERROR smithay_client_toolkit::window::concept_frame] No font could be found\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how do deal with either line 1 or 2.  On line one, it warns about radv.  But in my grub command I've modified it to set amdgpu on and radeon support off like so:\r\n\r\n>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=\"radeon.si_support=0 radeon.cik_support=0 amdgpu.si_support=1 amdgpu.cik_support=1 amdgpu.dc=1 amdgpu.dpm=1 amdgpu.modeset=1\"\r\n\r\nFor the second line of output (the \"ERROR smithay_client_toolkit::window::concept_frame\"), I have no idea what might fix that and nothing helpful showing up on search engines.\r\n\r\nAny advice on how to fix this?
