System\r\n\r\nOS: Windows 10\r\nVersion:  0.8.0\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is a sister issue of #5266.\r\n\r\nBy using this benchmark software https://github.com/cmuratori/termbench/releases/tag/V1, on Linux I found that  rendering non-colored text is about 70x faster than rendering colored-text (release build, version 0.8.0 from PopOS repo)\r\n\r\nNote that the benchmark currently can't run fully on Windows because of #5266. Still I am able to use VS to gather the performance trace of alacritty and this is what I got:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4710575/123376719-89a8ac00-d5bd-11eb-997f-9ff7ed75877e.png)\r\n\r\nThis shows that the CPU usage of VT parsing is a little higher than expected.\r\n\r\nNote that this trace is gathered using Debug build, because with Release build some of the stack is not available. Based on my result on Linux mentioned above, I think it's safe to say that VT parsing still drags the rendering behind when the load is heavy.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5278/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/868324680","html_url":"https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5266#issuecomment-868324680","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/5266","id":868324680,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2ODMyNDY4MA==","user":{"login":"chrisduerr","id":8886672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8886672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisduerr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisduerr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-25T08:35:34Z","updated_at":"2021-06-25T08:35:34Z","body":"The location where Alacritty is stuck would be much more useful than the location of its depedencies.

A long time ago I looked into implementing some of the things we wanted upstream, but large Visual Studio projects aren't my strong suit and I gave up trying to get the darn thing to build. If we had an issue tracking the things we wanted from upstream conpty perhaps we can coordinate on them together? As above not sure I'll achieve much but I'm at least somewhat familiar with the current limitations conpty puts on us.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/comments/876183916/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidhewitt","id":1939362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzkzNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1939362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidhewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/davidhewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidhewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidhewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidhewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidhewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidhewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidhewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidhewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidhewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidhewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4993028025,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDk5MzAyODAyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/4993028025","actor":{"login":"skyline75489","id":4710575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTA1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4710575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489","html_url":"https://github.com/skyline75489","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-08T06:59:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4993028028,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5OTMwMjgwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alacritty/alacritty/issues/events/4993028028","actor":{"login":"skyline75489","id":4710575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MTA1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4710575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489","html_url":"https://github.com/skyline75489","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skyline75489/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-08T06:59:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
