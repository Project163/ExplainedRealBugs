 Alacritty is focused on simplicity and performance. The performance goal means
 it should be faster than any other terminal emulator available. The simplicity
-goal means that it doesn't have many features like tabs or scroll back as in
-other terminals. Instead, it is expected that users of Alacritty make use of a
-terminal multiplexer such as [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).
+goal means that it doesn't have features such as tabs or splits (which can be
+better provided by a window manager or [terminal multiplexer][tmux]) nor
+niceties like a GUI config editor.
 
-This initial release should be considered to be **pre-alpha** software--it will
-have issues. Once Alacritty reaches an alpha level of readiness, precompiled
-binaries will be provided for supported operating systems.
+The software is considered to be at an **alpha** level of readiness--there are
+missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as a daily
+driver.
+
+Precompiled binaries will eventually be made available on supported platforms.
+This is minimally blocked on a stable config format. For now, Alacritty must be
+built from source.
