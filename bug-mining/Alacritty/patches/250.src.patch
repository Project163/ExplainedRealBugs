 ### Performance
 
+If changes could affect throughput or latency of Alacritty, these aspects should be benchmarked to
+prevent potential regressions. Since there are often big performance differences between Rust's
+nightly releases, it's advised to perform these tests on the latest Rust stable release.
+
 Alacritty mainly uses the [vtebench](https://github.com/jwilm/vtebench) tool for testing Alacritty's
-performance. Any change which could have an impact on Alacritty's performance, should be tested with
-it to prevent potential regressions.
+performance. Instructions on how to use it can be found in its
+[README](https://github.com/jwilm/vtebench/blob/master/README.md).

+Latency is another important factor for Alacritty. On X11, Windows, and macOS the
+[typometer](https://github.com/pavelfatin/typometer) tool allows measuring keyboard latency.
