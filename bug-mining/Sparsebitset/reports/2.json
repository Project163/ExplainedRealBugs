This is truly useful and a great addition to the JVM ecosystem of tools. \r\n\r\nI started looking at creating a pull request but given the complexity of the implementation I backed out and figured I would ask the implementor for help first. Let me know if this would be feasible and if so, whether this is something you could envision adding.
