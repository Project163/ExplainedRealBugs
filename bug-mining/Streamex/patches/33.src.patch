 * The package `javax.util.streamex` is renamed to `one.util.streamex`. Every occurrence of `javax.util.streamex` in source files must be replaced with `one.util.streamex`.
 * The OSGi Bundle-SymbolicName is changed from `javax.util.streamex` to `one.util.streamex`.
 * The Maven groupID is changed from `io.github.amaembo` to `one.util`. Dependencies in pom.xml files should be updated accordingly.
+* Added: `StreamEx.ofLines(Path)` and `StreamEx.ofLines(Path, Charset)`
 * Added: `MoreCollectors.commonPrefix()/commonSuffix()` short-circuiting collectors. 
 * Deprecated methods `StreamEx.ofEntries()` removed.
 * Deprecated methods `collectingAndThen` in primitive collectors removed (use `andThen()` instead).
