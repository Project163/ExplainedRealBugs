 ### 0.5.1
 
+* [#13] Added: `StreamEx.split` to split with single character delimiter.
 * [#28] Updated: now `StreamEx.select`, `EntryStream.selectKeys` and `EntryStream.selectValues` accept any type (not necessarily the subtype of current element).
+* [#32] Added: `MoreCollectors.dominators` collector which collects the elements to the list leaving only "dominators".   
 * [#33] Updated: `StreamEx.split("", pattern)` now returns stream of single `""` string instead of empty stream.
-* [#13] Added: `StreamEx.split` to split with single character delimiter.
 * [#35] Added: construction of all stream types from the `Iterator`.

-* [#32] Added: `MoreCollectors.dominators` collector which collects the elements to the list leaving only "dominators".
