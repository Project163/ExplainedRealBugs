 * Added: `StreamEx/IntStreamEx/LongStreamEx/DoubleStreamEx.mapLast/mapFirst` methods.
 * Added: `MoreCollectors.flatMapping` collector.
+* Added: `Joining` collector: an advanced version of `Collectors.joining` which may short-circuit.
 * Fixed: `StreamEx.cross(mapper)` now correctly handles the case when mapper returns null instead of empty stream.
 * Optimized: ordered stateful short-circuit collectors now may process less elements in parallel.
 * Optimized: `StreamEx/EntryStream.toList()/toListAndThen()/foldRight()/scanRight()` now faster, especially for sized stream.
