 * [#51] Fixed: `StreamEx.parallel(fjp).runLengths()` fails to run the task in the specified pool.
 * [#52] `StreamEx.append(T...)` and `prepend(T...)` are declared as @SafeVarargs and final now.
 * [#53] Optimized: `mapFirst`/`mapLast` methods will have less overhead now, especially for primitive streams.
+* [#54] Added: `StreamEx.headTail()`: map to the new stream using the first stream element and the stream of the rest elements. 
 
 ### 0.5.2
 * [#3] Optimized: parallel performance of `StreamEx.ofLines` as well as `StreamEx.split`
