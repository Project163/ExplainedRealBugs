Sometimes it's desired to track the current tree depth. This could be resolved adding new static methods to `EntryStream`:\n\n```\n<T> EntryStream<Integer, T> ofTree(T root, BiFunction<Integer, T, Stream<T>> mapper) {}\n<T, TT extends T> EntryStream<Integer, T> ofTree(T root, Class<TT> collectionClass,\n        BiFunction<Integer, TT, Stream<T>> mapper) {}\n```\n\nThe resulting stream contains elements in the values and the tree depth in the keys (0 = root, 1 = immediate root children and so on). Also mapper function receives depth now which allows, for example, to limit tree expansion by given depth:\n\n```\nEntryStream.ofTree(root, (depth, e) -> depth > MAX_DEPTH ? null : e.children());\n```\n\nIn this case depth could be easily dropped using `EntryStream.values()` if it's unnecessary after that.\n\nSimple implementation may use `flatMap`. Later improvement using custom spliterator is possible (see #17).\n- [x] Implementation\n- [x] Tests\n- [x] JavaDoc\n- [x] Changes\n- [x] Cheatsheet\n","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/42/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/42/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
