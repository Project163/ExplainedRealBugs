Sometimes it's not very convenient as different transformation for first and other elements or last and other elements is desired. Thus the following methods are proposed in `StreamEx`:\n\n``` java\npublic <R> StreamEx<R> mapFirstOrElse(Function<? super T, ? extends R> firstMapper,\n            Function<? super T, ? extends R> notFirstMapper) {}\npublic <R> StreamEx<R> mapLastOrElse(Function<? super T, ? extends R> notLastMapper,\n            Function<? super T, ? extends R> lastMapper) {}\n```\n\nUsage example:\n\n``` java\nStreamEx.of(\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\", \"orange\")\n        .mapLastOrElse(\"|- \"::concat, \"\\\\- \"::concat).joining(\"\\n\");\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n|- red\n|- green\n|- blue\n\\- orange\n```\n\n``` java\nStreamEx.split(\"testString\", \"\")\n        .mapFirstOrElse(String::toUpperCase, String::toLowerCase).joining();\n-> Teststring\n```\n\nProbably better names are possible (especially `mapLastOrElse` is somewhat confusing), ideas are welcome. We could omit primitive specializations currently as there are too many possibilities (like `IntStreamEx.mapFirstOrElseToLong`, etc.) and this functionality is not so widely useful, so boxing would be acceptable.\n- [x] Implementation\n- [x] JavaDoc\n- [x] Tests\n- [x] Changes\n- [x] Cheatsheet\n","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/85/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/85/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
