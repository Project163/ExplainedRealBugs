it's useful to extract the first stream element and use it to process other elements. Some solutions are proposed and discussed [here](http://stackoverflow.com/q/19803058/4856258). In StreamEx we must make such operation lazy: it should not consume any stream elements until the terminal operation is performed.\n\nTwo possible versions are proposed:\n\n```\nclass StreamEx<T> {\n    // Return EntryStream where keys are the same and represent the first stream element\n    // while values are the rest elements (the stream length is one element less than \n    // the original stream)\n    public EntryStream<T, T> withFirst() {...};\n\n    // Return StreamEx which elements are the result of applying the mapper function \n    // to the first stream element and every other element\n    <U> StreamEx<U> withFirst(BiFunction<T, T, U> mapper) { ... };\n}\n```\n\nThe biggest problem is the current `flatMap` bug: this code must produce 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n```\nStreamEx.of(0, 2, 4).flatMap(x -> Stream.of(x, x + 1)).parallel()\n              .withFirst().values().toList();\n```\n- [x] Implementation\n- [x] Tests\n- [x] JavaDoc\n- [x] Changes\n- [x] Cheatsheet\n\nIssue #54 extracted from this one as it's substantially

only `StreamEx.prepend(T...)` is TSO-optimized which is inconvenient sometimes. It would be better to reimplement the standard `.concat` operation fully with our own `TailConcatSpliterator` which will concatenate two streams and work as TSO for the second one.\n\nOther improvements which could be implemented here:\n- Do not create unnecessary close handlers.\n- Do not concatenate with SIZED/empty source: just wrap the original stream.\n- Use TSO internally, so the long series of `prepend` calls would not lead to StackOverflow error (though it would not work with `append`, but we can also consider \"rotating\" or even truly balancing the concatenation tree).\n\nPrimitive specializations could be postponed as we have no primitive `headTail` yet.\n\nRelated to #54.\n- [x] Implementation\n- [x] Additional tests\n- [x] Documentation updates\n- [x]

[here](https://github.com/amaembo/amaembo.github.io/issues/1) by @AgnetaWalterscheidt:\n\nI would like to implement a new method in `StreamEx` (or `AbstractStreamEx`):\n\n```\npublic StreamEx<E> skipSorted(int n, Comparator<? super E> comparator);\n```\n\nThe method skips the first n elements of the stream as if the stream was sorted using the comparator but without actually sorting the whole stream.\nThe method is similar to `MoreCollectors.greatest(Comparator<? super T>, int)` but \n- it uses the quickselect algorithm to do the partial sort and \n- it returns a stream instead of a Collector (which makes sense because skipping n elements can still return a stream with an infinite number of elements).\n\nFor symmetry I would like to implement a second method: \n\n```\npublic StreamEx<E> limitSorted(int n, Comparator<? super E> comparator);\n```\n\nwhich is the counterpart to the first method because it limits the stream by returning only the first n elements of the stream (after \"sorting\" it like in the first method). This method obviously does not return a stream with an infinite number of elements (the stream will have n or less elements) but I think it would be confusing for the users of your library to look for the second method somewhere else.\n\nI have already implemented a method `skipSorted()` that takes and returns an `Iterator`. You find the code below including a small test method (currently called from a main method).\nI have also implemented (not included but I can send you the code if you are interested) a method `skipSorted()` using a `PriorityQueue` for sorting, and one using a `TreeSet`. The quickselect implementation is on average about factor 3 faster than the others. \n\nThe `StreamEx` method could be implemented as a small wrapper around these methods.\n\nPlease tell me if you would like me to implement this!\n\nCheers\nAgneta\n\nCode:\n\n```\n/**\n * Implementation details: a buffer of size 2*n is filled.
