See this thread: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22569040/readerlines-parallelizes-badly-due-to-nonconfigurable-batch-size-policy-in-it\n\nI propose that `StreamEx` implements its own spliterator. There's a number of ways to do it. I think the most flexible would be to read ahead a certain number of bytes (eg, 256KB). If the file is smaller than that then we can know how many lines it has and return a real (ie, known-size) spliterator. If the file is larger than that, then we return something similar to an `IteratorSpliterator`, but I think it should still have a much smaller granularity than 1k.\n\nI wrote in the comments to my harshly down-voted answer that the root problem is the spliterator. It's meant to work well when the data is in memory (and is either in a randomly-accessible collection or a tree). It works poorly when we're, you know, actually _STREAMING_ data. The irony. What are your thoughts on that?\n","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/3/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/3/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
