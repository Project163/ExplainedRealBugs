you for proposal. It surely needs some evaluation before it can be integrated into StreamEx.\n\nFirst thing to note is that since StreamEx 0.5.4 there will be `chain` method (see #10) which allows to easily chain third-party operations in the following way. You may add your `skipSorted` code to some utility class in your project along with the following method:\n\n```\npublic static <T> UnaryOperator<StreamEx<T>> skipSorted(Comparator<T> comparator, int n) {\n    return stream -> StreamEx.of(skipSorted(stream.iterator(), comparator, n));\n}\n```\n\nNow you can use, for example:\n\n```\nStreamEx.of(input).map(...).chain(skipSorted(comparator, n)).filter(...).forEach(...);\n```\n\nSo even if some operation is absent in `StreamEx`, you can write it by yourself and use in moreless comfortable way.\n\nSo back to your operations. First, `limitSorted`. I don't like it. It will be full-stop operation (it cannot emit any elements until the whole upstream is processed). It's difficult to implement new full-stop operations with good parallel behavior given current Stream API. Also such operations are not streaming by nature. It's much better to collect using `greatest` or `least` collector and start a new stream at this point. This way it will be evident for developer that additional memory is necessary to store the whole intermediate result. It's a bad practice to try to put everything into single stream. The same thing with `groupingBy`. Some people asking how to implement analog to SQL `GROUP BY xxx HAVING yyy` in single stream, but it should not be done in single stream. You should collect first using `groupingBy`, then start new stream and filter it.\n\nNote that such `limitSorted` operation can be implemented quite easily using `headTail` operation (see #54). Here's testcase which illustrates this: 0fe7c2ba653961ae8078c91b88c2c5d707f6d057. It's just about 10 lines. So if somebody wants, he/she can add it to own utility class.\n\nNow `skipSorted`. It's more interesting, but has its pros and cons. It removes order, which is bad. Usually intermediate operation applied to the ordered stream returns ordered stream (except the `unordered()` operation, of course). This operation returns elements in some implementation-dependent order.\n\nIt potentially can be properly parallelized, which is good. Your implementation does not care about this, but it's possible to write correct parallel version which will use `O(n*parallelismLevel)` additional memory. As operation already removes ordering, this fact can be utilized to simplify the parallel implementation.\n\nI still want to take a look on `PriorityQueue` implementation. Usually `PriorityQueue` (when properly used) is quite fast, so I want to benchmark by myself.\n\nAlso it would be nice to see some use cases where such operations would be useful.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/175963625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/176882667","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo/streamex/issues/61#issuecomment-176882667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/61","id":176882667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3Njg4MjY2Nw==","user":{"login":"numeralnathan","id":1236594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzY1OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1236594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan","html_url":"https://github.com/numeralnathan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-29T17:46:16Z","updated_at":"2016-01-29T17:46:16Z","body":"Both of these methods have to do at least 1 pass at the entire stream before it can know which elements to skip or limit.

consider adding a method called limitSort(long max, ...) with all of the flavors sorted().  This method will return a stream which has up to max elements.  Passing Long.MAX_VALUE to max causes the limitSort() to behave the same as sorted().  Passing a lower value of max causes the \"highest\" elements to be discarded.\n\nFor example, if I need to look at the 10 oldest files, then I could do something like...\n\nStreamEx<File> stream;\n\nstream.\n   limitSort(10, File::lastModified).\n   ...\n\nOne could implement the same logic with the following...\n\nstream.\n   sorted(File::lastModified).\n   limit(10).\n   ...\n\nHowever, this pattern will hold all of the File objects in memory and sort them.  Ouch!  Whereas, limitSort() only needs to hold up to 10 (in this case) File objects in memory.\n\nInstead of implementing limitSort(), StreamEx could see a sorted() followed by a limit() and then merge the two operators into 1.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/69/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/69/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
