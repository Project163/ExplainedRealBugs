Some solutions are proposed and discussed [here](http://stackoverflow.com/q/19803058/4856258). In StreamEx we must make such operation lazy: it should not consume any stream elements until the terminal operation is performed.\n\nTwo possible versions are proposed:\n\n```\nclass StreamEx<T> {\n    // Return EntryStream where keys are the same and represent the first stream element\n    // while values are the rest elements (the stream length is one element less than \n    // the original stream)\n    public EntryStream<T, T> withFirst() {...};\n\n    // Return StreamEx which elements are the result of applying the mapper function \n    // to the first stream element and every other element\n    <U> StreamEx<U> withFirst(BiFunction<T, T, U> mapper) { ... };\n}\n```\n\nThe biggest problem is the current `flatMap` bug: this code must produce 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n```\nStreamEx.of(0, 2, 4).flatMap(x -> Stream.of(x, x + 1)).parallel()\n              .withFirst().values().toList();\n```\n- [x] Implementation\n- [x] Tests\n- [x] JavaDoc\n- [x] Changes\n- [x] Cheatsheet\n\nIssue #54 extracted from this one as it's substantially different.\n","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
