Thus probably it would be good to change the package name in 0.5.0 version.\n\nThe package will be renamed to `one.util.streamex`, so existing users upon update will need to search-and-replace `javax.util.streamex` with `one.util.streamex` across the sources. Also the OSGi `Bundle-SymbolicName` will be changed to `one.util.streamex`, thus probably manifests should be changed as well. ~~No changes in Maven group ID/artifact ID will be applied~~. Maven group ID will be changed to `one.util` to stay in sync with package/OSGi name.\n- [x] Register util.one\n- [x] Update codebase (rename packages in main and test)\n- [x] Update pom.xml to properly create OSGi manifest.\n- [x] Request access to the `one.util` group ID on Maven Central.\n- [x] Update pom.xml group ID.\n- [x] Update README.md to warn about the change; probably add short migration guide.\n- [x] Update README.md after 0.5.0 release to specify new group ID.\n- [x] Add redirects from old documentation URLs (like `http://amaembo.github.io/streamex/javadoc/javax/util/streamex/StreamEx.html`) to new ones (like `http://amaembo.github.io/streamex/javadoc/one/util/streamex/StreamEx.html`) preserving the anchor.\n","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/8/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
