is somewhat different from the original bugreport: `foldLeft` cannot parallelize independently.\n\nIt's not very hard to implement such `scanLeft` using the `headTail` operation. See [this example](https://github.com/amaembo/streamex/blob/7734dc5c9e63d85fc1ea9d54f7dfcd88c121904f/src/test/java/one/util/streamex/StreamExHeadTailTest.java#L205).\n\n``` java\nprivate static <T> StreamEx<T> scanLeft(StreamEx<T> input, BinaryOperator<T> operator) {\n    return input.headTail((head, tail) -> scanLeft(tail.mapFirst(cur -> operator.apply(head, cur)), operator)\n                .prepend(head));\n}\n\nstatic <T> UnaryOperator<StreamEx<T>> scanLeft(BinaryOperator<T> operator) {\n    return stream -> scanLeft(stream, operator);\n}\n\nStreamEx.of(integers).chain(scanLeft((a, b) -> a+b)).takeWhile(s -> s < 100).collect(last());\n```\n\nActually I was thinking about integration of such scenarios directly into the library. The usual concern is that such `scanLeft` intermediate operation is badly parallelized. I usually avoid badly parallelizable intermediate operations especially if they could be expressed via `headTail` (which is one of a few badly parallelizable operations I like: it allows to implement almost everything else).\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/208885843/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"danieldietrich","id":743833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/743833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldietrich","html_url":"https://github.com/danieldietrich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldietrich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldietrich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldietrich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldietrich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldietrich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldietrich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldietrich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldietrich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldietrich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-12T15:34:02Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T15:34:02Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vavr-io/vavr/issues/779","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vavr-io/vavr","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vavr-io/vavr/issues/779/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vavr-io/vavr/issues/779/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vavr-io/vavr/issues/779/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr/issues/779","id":115658375,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMTU2NTgzNzU=","number":779,"title":"foldRight
