The `PairSpliterator.forEachRemaining` (all four implementations ref/int/long/double) currently extracts one element from the source before calling `source.forEachRemaining`. It could be rewritten to avoid this first `tryAdvance` call which may greatly improve speed in some cases. Also memory footprint may be improved when upstream intermediate operations involve `flatMap` as buffering will become unnecessary.\n- [x] draft implementation\n  - [x] PSOfRef\n  - [x] PSOfInt\n  - [x] PSOfLong\n  - [x] PSOfDouble\n- [x] all tests passed\n- [x] benchmark\n- [x] update CHANGES.md\n","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/19/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
