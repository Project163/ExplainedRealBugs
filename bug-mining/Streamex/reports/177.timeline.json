an idea to implement a values emitter which can help creating the stream with non-trivial emission/termination strategy.\n\nGenerate the [Collatz sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture):\n\n```\npublic static Emitter<Integer> collatz(int start) {\n    return action -> {\n        action.accept(start);\n        return start == 1 ? null : collatz(start % 2 == 0 ? start / 2 : start * 3 + 1);\n    };\n}\n```\n\nUsage example:\n\n```\ncollatz(17).stream().toList();\n```\n\nGenerate a series of dice rolls representing the complete [Craps round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps):\n\n```\npublic static Emitter<Integer> crapsEmitter(IntSupplier dice, int point) {\n    return action -> {\n        int roll = dice.getAsInt();\n        action.accept(roll);\n        return roll == 7 || (point == 0 && (roll > 10 || roll < 4))\n                || (point != 0 && roll == point) ? null : crapsEmitter(dice,\n                point == 0 ? roll : point);\n    };\n}\n```\n\nUsage example:\n\n```\nRandom r = new Random();\nIntSupplier dice = () -> r.nextInt(6) + r.nextInt(6) + 2;\ncrapsEmitter(dice, 0).stream().forEach(System.out::println);\n```\n\nRead only ints from the specified `Scanner` leaving it in the known state:\n\n```\npublic static Emitter<Integer> scannerInts(Scanner sc) {\n    return sc.hasNextInt() ? action -> {\n        action.accept(sc.nextInt());\n        return scannerInts(sc);\n    } : null;\n}\n```\n\nIt's also easy to reimplement Stream.generate with emitter:\n\n```\npublic static <T> Emitter<T> generate(Supplier<T> supplier) {\n    return action -> {\n            action.accept(supplier.get());\n            return generate(supplier);\n    };\n}\n```\n\nOr `Stream.iterate` (even three-args form, see #79):\n\n```\npublic static <T> Emitter<T> iterate(T seed, Predicate<? super T> test, UnaryOperator<T> op) {\n    return test.test(seed) ? action -> {\n        action.accept(seed);\n        return iterate(op.apply(seed), test, op);\n    } : null;\n}\n```\n\nWhile such implementation add some overhead, it shows that the feature is quite powerful.\n\nIt's possible to implement this for primitive streams as well, though it should be tested whether `Emitter` overhead is not so significant compared to boxing overhead.\n- [x]
