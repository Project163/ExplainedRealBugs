I never tried using parallel streams with I/O in practice, but I think that there are not so many tasks where such change will be useful. If you have small file with CPU-consuming per-line processing, then reading it to the `List` sequentially, then process in parallel would be much better. You will not keep the file open during the whole operation, so you free the file handler faster (there are limited number of them usually) and file gets unlocked faster on Windows. If you have really big file, so reading it into memory seems to be unreasonable, then current spliterator strategy should work well. Anyways if we propose a new strategy, then it will be at least no worse than existing one for the most of common usages, thus extensive testing would be necessary.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/107127061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/108520261","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo/streamex/issues/3#issuecomment-108520261","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/3","id":108520261,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwODUyMDI2MQ==","user":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-03T16:48:45Z","updated_at":"2015-06-03T16:48:45Z","body":"I committed an optimized general purpose [IteratorSpliterator](https://github.com/amaembo/streamex/commit/16e1c2ecfc5d214c1feea6b953ccfbeb505ea273) for iterators of unknown size.

The `base` is `ArrayList.spliterator` which is very fast and should parallelize ideally. The `jdk` is `Spliterators.spliteratorUnknownSize` and `opt` is my new implementation. As you can see, for parallel streams my implementation is consistently better especially when the stream size (n) is approaching to `1024`. The problem I fixed is the transition from iterator mode to array mode. JDK spliterator splits badly at this point: it returns the `ArraySpliterator` while the original spliterator remains of zero size. This results in uneven tasks distribution. My spliterator supports both array mode and iterator mode and during the transition it changes itself as well.\n\nMore testing (and probably some minor optimization) is necessary, but for now results look quite promising. Meanwhile you can checkout the [optimized-iterator](https://github.com/amaembo/streamex/tree/optimized-iterator) branch and test it by yourself.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/108520261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/108548320","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo/streamex/issues/3#issuecomment-108548320","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/3","id":108548320,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwODU0ODMyMA==","user":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-03T17:59:19Z","updated_at":"2015-06-03T17:59:19Z","body":"One

replacement. On parallel tests for `trim` task JDK spliterator wins on `n <= 100`, because here less parallelism is actually better. Results of `opt` version are close to `base` (`ArrayList.spliterator`). I guess this can be ignored as sequential version for such task sizes is much faster.\n\nThe disappointing thing is that while `opt` version almost 2x faster than `jdk` on parallel pattern test, it's still almost 2x slower than `base` for `n=300..1000`.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/108548320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/121149923","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo/streamex/issues/3#issuecomment-121149923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/3","id":121149923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMTE0OTkyMw==","user":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-07-14T07:13:16Z","updated_at":"2015-07-14T07:13:16Z","body":"We had some [discussion](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/core-libs-dev/2015-July/034528.html) about this issue in core-libs-dev mailing list.

finally found a better solution to this problem. Now all the processors should be used when `ofLines` is executed and parallel performance should reach the maximum. On the other hand the general batching strategy did not change (it still starts with 1024 lines). Some minor overhead could be added when processing very long files ( > 1000000 lines ) compared to JDK implementation, but preliminary benchmarks show that it's negligible. If JDK-9 optimized Files.lines is available (when using `StreamEx.ofLines(path)`), then it will be used instead of my optimization. The code is committed and targeted to 0.5.2 release.
