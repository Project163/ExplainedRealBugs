This limits the possibilities to use method references with javac <8u102 (see [JDK-8143647](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8143647)). Seems that ECJ also sometimes compiles such references incorrectly. Here's testcase which fails:\n\n``` java\nList<String> input = asList(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\");\nassertEquals(input, input.stream().map(StreamEx::of).reduce(StreamEx::append).get().toList());\n```\n\nWhen compiling with javac:\n\n```\njava.lang.IllegalAccessError: one/util/streamex/AbstractStreamEx\n```\n\nWhen compiling with ecj:\n\n```\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: one.util.streamex.StreamEx.append(Ljava/util/stream/Stream;)Lone/util/streamex/StreamEx;\n```\n\nSeems that it's possible to make `AbstractStreamEx` public which would also solve some javadoc-related issues and compilation errors in some corner cases (like reported in #81). If you have better idea for its name, you're welcome.\n- [x] Write AbstractStreamEx class JavaDoc\n- [x] Make it public\n- [x] Deduplicate `chain` method\n- [x] Provide at least some tests from another package which validate this change (see also #91)\n- [x] Changes\n","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/90/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/90/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
