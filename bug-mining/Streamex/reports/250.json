I guess they flipped a coin? In my entire life I have never used the one-argument valuemapper, but I write this all the time:\r\n\r\n`toMap(Thing::getKey, Function.identity())`\r\n\r\nIt would be more ergonomic to simply write:\r\n\r\n`toMapKey(Thing::getKey)`\r\n\r\n(or any other method name; it doesn't have to be `toMapKey`)\r\n\r\nIt would be lovely if StreamEx added this little convenience method.
