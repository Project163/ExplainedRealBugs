Such operation cannot be implemented efficiently for parallel streams, so I decided not to make this at all. So I cannot answer to that SO question. Instead you can \"merge\" two arrays or random access lists via [`StreamEx.zip`](http://amaembo.github.io/streamex/javadoc/javax/util/streamex/StreamEx.html#zip-java.util.List-java.util.List-java.util.function.BiFunction-) or [`EntryStream.zip`](http://amaembo.github.io/streamex/javadoc/javax/util/streamex/EntryStream.html#zip-java.util.List-java.util.List-). I wrote, for example, [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/30271289/4856258) and [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32345142/4856258) answers to describe such feature.\n\nCurrently the primary information source for StreamEx is [JavaDoc](http://amaembo.github.io/streamex/javadoc/). It's quite comprehend and describes almost all methods (though some are still missing the documentation). Adding every single feature to the README.md sounds too much. However I'm thinking about writing the tutorial describing most of the features with some real world examples. Unfortunately so far I had no time to work on such tutorial.
