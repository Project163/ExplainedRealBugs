I figured out a solution, but I need some help.  If StreamEx were to implement nonNull(), then the solution would be easy.  In other words, please add the following to StreamEx...\r\n\r\n```\r\n   public StreamEx<T> nonNull() {\r\n      return(super.nonNull());\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the above code in place, I can then write the following in StreamEx.eea.\r\n\r\n```\r\nnonNull\r\n ()Lone.util.streamex.StreamEx<TT>;\r\n ()L1one.util.streamex.StreamEx<T1T>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure if EntryStream needs to do likewise and implement nonNull().  If this would mean that the Map.Entry's would be guaranteed to be non-null instead of the keys and values, then I don't know how useful nonNull() is.","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
