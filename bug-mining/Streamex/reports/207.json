Think simple examples that elucidate the operation. For example:\n#### `StreamEx.cross()`\n\nExample: `StreamEx.of(1, 2).cross(4, 5) -> {1,4}, {1, 5}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}`.\n\nI feel like either the cheatsheet or the Javadoc should have this. It allows the user (at least myself) to grok/test the concept almost immediately.
