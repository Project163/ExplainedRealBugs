I already thought about such feature and unfortunately again I don't like it. There are several reasons (probably partially the same which lead to removal of `zip` from JDK). First, zipped stream cannot be efficiently parallelized even if both original streams can. That's because original streams can split at different positions and they even don't have to report the splitting position. Second, even for non-short-circuiting operation you cannot use `Spliterator.forEachRemaining` internally. For some streams `Spliterator.tryAdvance` is much less efficient. Third, having parallel streams (where n-th element of the first stream corresponds to the n-th element of the second stream) actually smells. This might be reasonable in purely functional languages where tuples rule. But Java is still object-oriented language. If you have `Stream<A>` and `Stream<B>` and first A corresponds to the first B, how did you get such streams? Why don't you have `Stream<AB>` where `AB` is the object which encapsulates both A and B?\n\nFinally we already have `EntryStream.zip(List, List)` and `EntryStream.zip(A[], B[])` which are free of the first two problems. So new method would be useful for stream sources which are not arrays or random access lists. Also if you want to zip the list with indices (like `zip(IntStream.range(0, list.size()).boxed(), list.stream())`), then we already have `EntryStream.of(List)`.\n\nIf you have some other practical use-cases when zipped stream is necessary and cannot be expressed with existing methods, please tell me. In general I tend to think that adding `zip(Stream, Stream)` may cause the overuse of such method instead of more efficient alternatives.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/175975998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/176197199","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo/streamex/issues/60#issuecomment-176197199","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/60","id":176197199,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjE5NzE5OQ==","user":{"login":"numeralnathan","id":1236594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzY1OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1236594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan","html_url":"https://github.com/numeralnathan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-28T14:01:15Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T14:55:56Z","body":"Because StreamEx is powerful, I am switching over to returning streams from methods and passing streams as arguments instead of using `List`.

I think that depends if the source streams are parallel and if the implementation can be executed in parallel.\n\nI am not sure how you are going to be able to have 2 threads pulling from 2 streams without getting the elements mixed in the wrong order.  For example, lets say Thread A pulls from the first stream.  Then, Thread B pulls from the first stream and the second stream.  Then, Thread A pulls from the second stream.  Now, both threads have mismatched elements.  Thread A should have pulled from the second stream before Thread B pulls from the second stream.\n\nSplitting streams won’t work because we can’t force both split streams to have the same number of elements.\n\nIt turns out that I took the easy route and not necessarily the performant route.  I changed the streams to Iterators and then implemented an Iterator which pulls from both.  I then convert the Iterator back into a stream.

In my use case, that would be very tricky to get the stream lengths to match.  \n\nConsider simply stopping when either stream comes to the end.  Consider implementing zip(Stream<A> first, Stream<B> second) but also implement zip(Stream<A> first, Stream<B> second, Consumer<A> extraFirst, Consumer<B> extraSecond).  In the latter case, the extra elements are dumped into the consumers.\n\n> can we perform some optimizations for SIZED/SUBSIZED sources\n\nYou have a lot of good questions.  I am glad you are developing StreamEx and not me.  I would just plough ahead and miss a lot of important cases.  Please give zip stream a thought and let me know what you decide.  Your insights are very helpful.\n\n> Using peek with terminal count may fail in JDK-9 where count for sized stream does not traverse the input at all.\n\nScary!  That’s a great optimization but only if the intermediate operators allow for it.  I would think peek and filter would not allow for it.  Yet, map, skip and limit would allow for it.\n\n-Nathan\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/176246857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"numeralnathan","id":1236594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzY1OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1236594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan","html_url":"https://github.com/numeralnathan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/176289104","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo/streamex/issues/60#issuecomment-176289104","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/60","id":176289104,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NjI4OTEwNA==","user":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-28T17:16:35Z","updated_at":"2016-01-28T17:16:50Z","body":"The simple parallelization optimization would be to trySplit() both original streams if both are SUBSIZED and their size is exactly the same.

Yet, map, skip and limit would allow for it.\n\n`peek` does not clear SIZED characteristic, but `skip` and `limit` clear it in current implementation (though this might change in future).\n\nAlso by the way beware of this technique:\n\n```\nfinal Iterable<T> iterable = () -> iterator;\nreturn StreamSupport.stream(iterable.spliterator(), parallel);\n```\n\nIt creates unordered stream!\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/177164559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/177190071","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo/streamex/issues/60#issuecomment-177190071","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/60","id":177190071,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NzE5MDA3MQ==","user":{"login":"numeralnathan","id":1236594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzY1OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1236594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan","html_url":"https://github.com/numeralnathan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numeralnathan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-30T14:16:48Z","updated_at":"2016-01-30T14:16:48Z","body":"Thank you for implementing this.\n\n> beware of this technique:\n\nBefore I encountered StreamEx, I would do exactly that to create a stream from an iterator when I couldn't figure out another way to create a stream.  Now, that I have the power of StreamEx, I use `StreamEx.of(iterator)`.\n\nI am truly grateful for StreamEx.  It provides the power and flexibility to really make streams more applicable in code.  Recently, I had to modify some code I wrote a while ago.  The original implementation used a for loop because the operations in the body couldn't be put into a Java 8 `Stream`.  With StreamEx, I was able re-implemented the for loop as a StreamEx!
