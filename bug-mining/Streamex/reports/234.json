often in the need to use immutable `LinkedHashSet`s that got generated by streams:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nSet<String> set = StreamEx.of(columnList)\r\n    .map(ColumnDescriptor::getPath)\r\n    .toCollection(LinkedHashSet::new);\r\n\r\ncolumnPaths = Collections.unmodifiableSet(set);\r\n```\r\nor\r\n\r\n```java\r\ncolumnPaths = StreamEx.of(columnList)\r\n    .map(ColumnDescriptor::getPath)\r\n    .collect(\r\n        Collectors.collectingAndThen(\r\n            Collectors.toCollection(LinkedHashSet::new),\r\n            Collections::unmodifiableSet));\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that something like this can be very handy, does not bloat the API and does not interfere with existing code (from specific to general, just one of these):\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic Set<T> toImmutableSet(Supplier<Set<T>> collectionFactory) {\r\n    return Collections.unmodifiableSet(toCollection(collectionFactory));\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic <C extends Collection<T>, R> R toCollectionAndThen(Supplier<C> collectionFactory, Function<? super C, ? extends R> finisher) {\r\n    return finisher.apply(toCollection(collectionFactory));\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic <A, R, RR> RR collectAndThen(Collector<T, A, R> downstream, Function<R, RR> finisher) {\r\n    return rawCollect(Collectors.collectingAndThen(downstream, finisher));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nso that the previous code can become:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ncolumnPaths = StreamEx.of(columnList)\r\n    .map(ColumnDescriptor::getPath)\r\n    .toImmutableSet(LinkedHashSet::new);\r\n\r\ncolumnPaths = StreamEx.of(columnList)\r\n    .map(ColumnDescriptor::getPath)\r\n    .toCollectionAndThen(LinkedHashSet::new, Collections::unmodifiableSet);\r\n\r\ncolumnPaths = StreamEx.of(columnList)\r\n    .map(ColumnDescriptor::getPath)\r\n    .collectAndThen(\r\n        Collectors.toCollection(LinkedHashSet::new), \r\n        Collections::unmodifiableSet);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
