consider adding a method called limitSort(long max, ...) with all of the flavors sorted().  This method will return a stream which has up to max elements.  Passing Long.MAX_VALUE to max causes the limitSort() to behave the same as sorted().  Passing a lower value of max causes the \"highest\" elements to be discarded.\n\nFor example, if I need to look at the 10 oldest files, then I could do something like...\n\nStreamEx<File> stream;\n\nstream.\n   limitSort(10, File::lastModified).\n   ...\n\nOne could implement the same logic with the following...\n\nstream.\n   sorted(File::lastModified).\n   limit(10).\n   ...\n\nHowever, this pattern will hold all of the File objects in memory and sort them.  Ouch!  Whereas, limitSort() only needs to hold up to 10 (in this case) File objects in memory.\n\nInstead of implementing limitSort(), StreamEx could see a sorted() followed by a limit() and then merge the two operators into

`LimiterSort` implementation shows significant improvement in number of comparisons, compared to 0.5.4, while supporting nulls and preserving stability.\n\nThe following tests were performed:\n- asc - already sorted input\n- desc - sorted in reverse order\n- rnd - random integers\n- rnd2 - random integers in range -1000..999\n- groups - concatenation of ten sequences of random integers (roughly equal size) presorted in ascending and descending order\n- pairDesc - sorted in reverse order with every pair swapped (like 9, 10, 7, 8, 5, 6, 3, 4, 1, 2)\n- pairAsc - sorted in ascending order with every pair swapped (like 2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 8, 7, 10, 9)\n\nThe `least()` collector was examined. Different input size and limit values were tested. For reference the result is compared with `.sorted().limit(limit).toList()` which yields the same result. Sequential collection (ratio is 0.5.5/0.5.4; lower is better):\n\n| test | size | limit | Sorted | 0.5.4 Seq | 0.5.5 Seq | Ratio |\n| --- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |\n| asc | 10 | 0 | 9 | 0 | 0 | -
