Currently there's no easy way to create a Stream of it (though Java-9 will add `asIterator()` default method which will make things easier — see [JDK-8072726](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8072726)). Nevertheless (even in Java-9) it would be useful to have\n\n```\nStreamEx<T> StreamEx.of(Enumeration<T>)\n```\n\nThis method would create an Iterator and use `StreamEx.of(Iterator<T>)` (see #35).\n- [x] Implementation\n- [x] Tests\n- [x] JavaDoc\n- [x] Changes\n- [x] Cheatsheet\n","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/36/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/36/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
