Currently people often use `stream.forEach(collection::add)` which does not work in parallel (if collection is not concurrent) or `stream.forEachOrdered(collection::add)` which is longer and would be less efficient than possible. In parallel in many cases it would be more efficient to use `collection.addAll(Arrays.asList(stream.toArray()))`, but for sequential stream `stream.forEachOrdered(collection::add)` should be better. If stream is sized and collection is `ArrayList`, probably calling `ensureCapacity` in advance should be considered for better performance. Also such call may return the collection itself making the API more fluent.\n","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/123/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
