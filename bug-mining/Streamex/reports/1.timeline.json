For example, this test fails:\n\n```\nassertEquals(IntStreamEx.range(1, 5000).mapToObj(String::valueOf).toSet(),\n        StreamEx.ofLines(new StringReader(input)).skip(1).parallel().toSet());\n```\n\nThat's because `Collectors.toSet()` which is used internally is an unordered collector, thus it switches the stream to an unordered state, and in this state `skip` is allowed to skip any element. That's an interesting case which could be considered as a Stream API bug. You can fix this by using alternative ordered collector like this:\n\n```\nassertEquals(IntStreamEx.range(1, 5000).mapToObj(String::valueOf).toSet(),\n        StreamEx.ofLines(new StringReader(input)).skip(1).parallel().toCollection(HashSet::new));\n```\n\nOr you can define your own collector which removes the `UNORDERED` characteristic. By the way the `pairMap` hack works well even with unordered collector.

The thing is that `parallel` and `unordered` characteristics are not shared between the pipelines, so even if `toSet()` is unordered, this makes only the last pipeline unordered, but the first pipeline remains ordered. This should work nicely with any unordered terminal operation like `findAny` or `forEach` as well. I did not check yet how this would affect the performance. So you are free to checkout this branch and try this method. If it proves to be useful, I will include it to some later release (probably 0.3.2). The name `recreate()` maybe not the very best one, so I'm considering the alternatives as well.\n\nPlease note that I'm not going to \"fix\" the existing skip method for a reason. The idea of my library is to _extend_ the Stream API, which means that at every point where standard `Stream` is already used, it can be replaced with `StreamEx` with no visible changes (see [Liskov substitution principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)). So if standard stream API has weird behavior or even bugs, then it should be the same when using StreamEx.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/107122922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":330190788,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDMzMDE5MDc4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/events/330190788","actor":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-13T13:06:05Z","milestone":{"title":"0.3.2"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":330190806,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQzMzAxOTA4MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/events/330190806","actor":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-13T13:06:14Z","assignee":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/111709493","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo/streamex/issues/4#issuecomment-111709493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/4","id":111709493,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMTcwOTQ5Mw==","user":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/511
