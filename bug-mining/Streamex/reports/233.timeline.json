I thought about adding `.sortedByKey()` and `.sortedByValue()`, but it's not much shorter than `.sortedBy(Entry::getKey)` and `.sortedBy(Entry::getValue)`.\r\n\r\nOne problem with the `.sortedByKey()` the method is weak type safety: if your keys aren't comparable you still may call this method causing a runtime exception (the same problem has a standard `.sorted()` method). On the other hand `.sorted(Entry.comparingByKey())` or `.sortedBy(Entry::getKey)` are type-safe: the stream won't compile if keys aren't comparable. So adding a new method will encourage people to write non-type-safe code which is not very good...","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/553371250/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/comments/553423043","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo/streamex/issues/207#issuecomment-553423043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/207","id":553423043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzQyMzA0Mw==","user":{"login":"SimSonic","id":2697754,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTc3NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2697754?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimSonic","html_url":"https://github.com/SimSonic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimSonic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimSonic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimSonic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimSonic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimSonic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimSonic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimSonic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimSonic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimSonic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T14:17:29Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T14:19:58Z","body":"I
