It's possible to implement it via `headTail()`, but having dedicated operation with fast primitive specializations and possible parallelization would be better. The proposed name is `prefix()` (compare with `Arrays.parallelPrefix()`). Unlike `scanLeft()` the new operation will demand associative operator as this might help making parallel implementation more efficient. It's quite possible (though research is necessary) to optimize parallel unordered case (which is useful sometimes). Parallel ordered case could be based on [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum#Parallel_algorithm) algorithm and investigated/implemented later as separate issue.\n\nUnlike `scanLeft` overloads `prefix()` will not have identity argument (only binary operator). If identity is necessary, it can be easily emulated with `prepend(identity).prefix(op)`.\n- [x] Object implementation with AbstractSpliterator (35bce0a)\n- [x] Unordered parallel implementation (high-contention) (35bce0a)\n- [x] Unordered parallel implementation (two-pass, buffering, low-contention) (35bce0a)\n- [x] Implementations benchmarking\n- [x] Primitive specializations\n- [x] JavaDoc\n- [x] Tests\n- [x] Changes\n- [x] Cheatsheet\n","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/94/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/94/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
