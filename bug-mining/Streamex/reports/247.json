have `StreamEx.toList()` that explicitly specified as returning a mutable collection. However, in JDK 16, `Stream.toList()` method was added that is explicitly specified as returning an unmodifiable collection. So, since JDK 16, `StreamEx` violates the Stream interface specification. We need to introduce a *breaking* change to align them:\r\n\r\n- Create explicit `toMutableList()` method that returns a mutable list\r\n- Remove mutability guarantee from `toList()` specification.\r\n- Make `toList()` an alias to `toMutableList()` by default\r\n- Add a system property `streamex.default.immutable`. When it's set to true, `toList()` starts behaving like `toImmutableList()`. This way, users can test their code whether it's ready for the subsequent change.\r\n- Add a notice that in future release, `toList()` will be aliased to `toImmutableList()`.\r\n- Bump version to 0.8.0\r\n\r\nThe same will be done for `toSet()`. For now, let's keep `toMap()` as is, as there are too many overloads and changes there would make things even more confusing, and bloated.\r\n\r\nAlso, the behavior of `toListAndThen()` and `toSetAndThen()` is not changed: the collection supplied to the lambda will still be mutable (even though it's not specified).","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
