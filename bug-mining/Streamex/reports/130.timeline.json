[here](https://github.com/amaembo/amaembo.github.io/issues/1) by @AgnetaWalterscheidt:\n\nI would like to implement a new method in `StreamEx` (or `AbstractStreamEx`):\n\n```\npublic StreamEx<E> skipSorted(int n, Comparator<? super E> comparator);\n```\n\nThe method skips the first n elements of the stream as if the stream was sorted using the comparator but without actually sorting the whole stream.\nThe method is similar to `MoreCollectors.greatest(Comparator<? super T>, int)` but \n- it uses the quickselect algorithm to do the partial sort and \n- it returns a stream instead of a Collector (which makes sense because skipping n elements can still return a stream with an infinite number of elements).\n\nFor symmetry I would like to implement a second method: \n\n```\npublic StreamEx<E> limitSorted(int n, Comparator<? super E> comparator);\n```\n\nwhich is the counterpart to the first method because it limits the stream by returning only the first n elements of the stream (after \"sorting\" it like in the first method). This method obviously does not return a stream with an infinite number of elements (the stream will have n or less elements) but I think it would be confusing for the users of your library to look for the second method somewhere else.\n\nI have already implemented a method `skipSorted()` that takes and returns an `Iterator`. You find the code below including a small test method (currently called from a main method).\nI have also implemented (not included but I can send you the code if you are interested) a method `skipSorted()` using a `PriorityQueue` for sorting, and one using a `TreeSet`. The quickselect implementation is on average about factor 3 faster than the others. \n\nThe `StreamEx` method could be implemented as a small wrapper around these methods.\n\nPlease tell me if you would like me to implement this!\n\nCheers\nAgneta\n\nCode:\n\n```\n/**\n * Implementation details: a buffer of size 2*n is filled.
