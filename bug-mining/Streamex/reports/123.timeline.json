If your source is sized (collection, array, etc.), you may easily express it via `limit(collection.size()-n)` (which will be actually much more optimal as it will short-circuit and don't use intermediate memory). If you want to skip just one element, you can use existing `.mapLast(x -> null).nonNull()` (assuming that the original stream contains no `null` values, otherwise you can use some other special value).

It has a lot of utilities that I wished Java 8 Stream had.\n\nThank you for the example on how to use headTail().  I’m going to have to study it for a while to figure it out.  It seems to me that this is recursive.  Every time 1 element is taken from the stream a new StreamEx is created.  Yikes!  Do I understand this code correctly?  I suppose the recursive nature depends upon the implementation of headTail() itself.\n\nIs chain() a method inside StreamEx or AbstractStreamEx?  I tried looking for it and didn’t find it in the source code or through Eclipse IDE method list.  I am wondering if this is on a private branch of yours.  I understand this method easily and it is powerful.  It means I can “extend” StreamEx with my own functionality.\n\nMy use case for skipLast() is for file rotation. I walk a tree of directories inside a Spliterator.  I then wrap it into a Stream.  I then filter out the files which are not log files.  I don’t need to sort the entire list of files since the directories are walked in creation order and the files in each directory are sorted.  At this point, I don’t have a count otherwise I could use limit().  I then want to keep the youngest N files.  These files are at the tail of the stream.  I can’t reverse the stream (and then skip()) since that would load all of the File objects into memory.\n\nI am not seeing the OutOfMemoryError in my code.  The first call to tryAdvance() will spin in the loop 3 times and then return false because the input stream is exhausted.
