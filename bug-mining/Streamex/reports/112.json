It would be better to reimplement the standard `.concat` operation fully with our own `TailConcatSpliterator` which will concatenate two streams and work as TSO for the second one.\n\nOther improvements which could be implemented here:\n- Do not create unnecessary close handlers.\n- Do not concatenate with SIZED/empty source: just wrap the original stream.\n- Use TSO internally, so the long series of `prepend` calls would not lead to StackOverflow error (though it would not work with `append`, but we can also consider \"rotating\" or even truly balancing the concatenation tree).\n\nPrimitive specializations could be postponed as we have no primitive `headTail` yet.\n\nRelated to #54.\n- [x] Implementation\n- [x] Additional tests\n- [x] Documentation updates\n- [x] Changes\n","closed_by":{"login":"amaembo","id":5114450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5114450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo","html_url":"https://github.com/amaembo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amaembo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/55/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amaembo/streamex/issues/55/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
