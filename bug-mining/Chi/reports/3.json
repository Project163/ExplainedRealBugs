There is workaround, I need to set my not-found handler for protected router explicitly too. Maybe on mount it's better to go through all subrouters and set not-found router there? If that's alright, I can make pull request.","closed_by":{"login":"pkieltyka","id":18831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka","html_url":"https://github.com/pkieltyka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-chi/chi/issues/110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-chi/chi/issues/110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
