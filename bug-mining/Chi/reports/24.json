For example:\n```\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\n\t\"github.com/go-chi/chi/v5\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\tr := chi.NewMux()\n\n\tchi.RegisterMethod(\"QUACK\")\n\tr.MethodFunc(\"QUACK\", \"/quack\", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n\t\tw.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)\n\t})\n\n\tchi.Walk(r, func(method string, route string, handler http.Handler, _ ...func(http.Handler) http.Handler) error {\n\t\tfmt.Println(method, route)\n\t\treturn nil\n\t})\n}\n```\n\nI believe the change responsible for this is https://github.com/go-chi/chi/commit/9b9fb55def404397748a9fc7e044efe9db1d618e, which changed method name lookup to use `reverseMethodMap` instead of a utility function which iterated `methodMap`. As far as I can tell, the problem is that `reverseMethodMap` is not updated by `RegisterMethod`, so the lookup fails and the route is not added.","closed_by":{"login":"VojtechVitek","id":139342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTM0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/139342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/VojtechVitek","html_url":"https://github.com/VojtechVitek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VojtechVitek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VojtechVitek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VojtechVitek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VojtechVitek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VojtechVitek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VojtechVitek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VojtechVitek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VojtechVitek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/VojtechVitek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-chi/chi/issues/1021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-chi/chi/issues/1021/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
