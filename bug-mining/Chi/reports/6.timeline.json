was a fix put in (#148) a while ago that introduced use of url.RawPath as the basis for the route path.\r\nHowever, as I understand it, RawPath is only a _hint_ and doesn't always include the actual URL encoded path. It only contains the path if it differs from the default encoding of the path. In other words, RawPath being blank doesn't mean that the path requires URL encoding, or that the path originally contained no URL encoded elements, just that the original path can be reconstructed from path.\r\nThe relevant code in url is:\r\n```\r\n// setPath sets the Path and RawPath fields of the URL based on the provided\r\n// escaped path p. It maintains the invariant that RawPath is only specified\r\n// when it differs from the default encoding of the path.\r\n// For example:\r\n// - setPath(\"/foo/bar\")   will set Path=\"/foo/bar\" and RawPath=\"\"\r\n// - setPath(\"/foo%2fbar\") will set Path=\"/foo/bar\" and RawPath=\"/foo%2fbar\"\r\n// setPath will return an error only if the provided path contains an invalid\r\n// escaping.\r\nfunc (u *URL) setPath(p string) error {\r\n\tpath, err := unescape(p, encodePath)\r\n\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\treturn err\r\n\t}\r\n\tu.Path = path\r\n\tif escp := escape(path, encodePath); p == escp {\r\n\t\t// Default encoding is fine.\r\n\t\tu.RawPath = \"\"\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tu.RawPath = p\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the condition is not \"does the path need escaping\" but \"does the original rawpath equal the escaped form of the path\".\r\n\r\nIn other words, rather than consulting RawPath, I believe that the code should be consulting EscapedPath().\r\n\r\nThere is no particularly easy workaround to this. I can't decode the result from chi.URLParam, because it _might_ already be decoded, but might not.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a bug in the fix supplied for #148, or rather that the fix didn't cater for all scenarios. \r\n\r\nI'm happy to provide a PR for this if it's felt that this is a bug.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-chi/chi/issues/641/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-chi/chi/issues/641/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"nawa","id":441946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTk0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/441946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nawa","html_url":"https://github.com/nawa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nawa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nawa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nawa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nawa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nawa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nawa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nawa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nawa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nawa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-22T21:54:41Z","updated_at":"2021-07-22T21:54:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-chi/chi/issues/642","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-chi/chi","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-chi/chi/issues/642/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-chi/chi/issues/642/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-chi/chi/issues/642/events","html_url":"https://github.com/go-chi/chi/issues/642","id":951090259,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5NTEwOTAyNTk=","number":642,"title":"Issues

The initial issue\r\n\r\nI was faced with issues in URL params escaping. I can show them using two examples, but there could be more. So, clients can send to the server two requests with the next path\r\n\t\r\n- `/api/first%25%20second` - it is a usual path in which all symbols that need to be escaped are escaped\r\n- `/api/first%20(second)`  - it is the case of how Chrome/Firefox/Safari escape URL in address bar or using `encodeURI()`. Parenthesis aren't escaped, but Go escaping algo expects that they are\r\n\r\nThen I'm trying to read variable `param` using pattern `/api/{param}` with `URLParam(r, name)` and expecting that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n| request URL | Expected `param` | Actual `param` |\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n| /api/first%25%20second | first% second | <text style=\"color:blue\">first% second</text> |\r\n| /api/first%20(second) | first (second) | <text style=\"color:red\">first%20(second)</text> |\r\n\r\nThe first case passed correctly but in the second case I read `first%20(second)` instead of `first (second)`. **The main misunderstanding - what I need to do in handlers, do I need to unescape params myself or not, why sometimes params are still escaped?**\r\n\r\nExample: https://github.com/nawa/chi/commit/b0c424038f640e0d72035edea75ed06589dc5ce0\r\n\r\nHaving escaped params, I'm assuming that I have to unescape them myself and trying to do that https://github.com/nawa/chi/commit/11ccf398f5bea11486dfbc10f3777f508ba385f7\r\n\r\nAfter that, I see opposite results - the second case passed because `first%20(second)` is unescaped to `first (second)` correctly. But the first case failed at all because the string `first% second` is incorrect to unescape and `url.PathUnescape(URLParam(r, name))` returns error\r\n\r\n**So, as you can see client can't easily determine how to read the correct value**\r\n\r\n### Workaround for the initial issue\r\n\r\nSeems that I found a workaround that I'm using now in my handlers to read all URL params\r\n\r\n```go\r\nvalue := URLParam(r, name)\r\nif r.URL.RawPath != \"\" {\r\n\tvalue, _ = url.PathUnescape(value) // it is better to handle error\r\n}\r\n\r\nreturn value\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee full workaround and more test cases - https://github.com/nawa/chi/commit/00f16715671c0749031abb98468af44d1192ff19\r\n\r\n\r\n### Solutions resolving the issues\r\nDescribed inconsistency should be resolved in `chi` and it should give a clear understanding to the client - does he always need to unescape params or not\r\n\r\n#### 1. All URL params are UNESCAPED in the router and client doesn't need to unescape them. All methods impact benchmarks and contain breaking changes\r\n##### First method\r\nhttps://github.com/nawa/chi/commit/92c5ba66d2b99e8799c5a93b5088322b2b6ed1ee\r\n\r\nBenchmarks comparison\r\n\r\n```\r\nenchmark                                               old ns/op     new ns/op     delta\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/-8                                  345           353           +2.44%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/hi-8                                368           380           +3.29%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sup/123/and/this-8                  479           584           +21.94%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sup/123/foo/this-8                  601           716           +19.10%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sharing/z/aBc-8                     600           670           +11.68%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sharing/z/aBc/twitter-8             716           833           +16.23%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sharing/z/aBc/direct-8              842           956           +13.57%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sharing/z/aBc/direct/download-8     940           1131          +20.26%\r\nBenchmarkTreeGet-8                                      131           153           +16.44%\r\n\r\nbenchmark                                               old allocs     new allocs     delta\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/-8                                  3              3              +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/hi-8                                3              3              +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sup/123/and/this-8                  3              3              +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sup/123/foo/this-8                  3              3              +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sharing/z/aBc-8                     3              3              +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sharing/z/aBc/twitter-8             4              4              +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sharing/z/aBc/direct-8              4              4              +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sharing/z/aBc/direct/download-8     5              5              +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkTreeGet-8                                      0              0              +0.00%\r\n\r\nbenchmark                                               old bytes     new bytes     delta\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/-8                                  448           448           +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/hi-8                                448           448           +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sup/123/and/this-8                  448           448           +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sup/123/foo/this-8                  448           448           +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sharing/z/aBc-8                     448           448           +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sharing/z/aBc/twitter-8             456           456           +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sharing/z/aBc/direct-8              456           456           +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkMux/route:/sharing/z/aBc/direct/download-8     480           480           +0.00%\r\nBenchmarkTreeGet-8                                      0             0             +0.00%\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Second method.
