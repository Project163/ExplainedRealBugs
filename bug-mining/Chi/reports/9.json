Currently, example given for JSON, it only matches exactly `application/json` although it is a quit common real-world behaviour to send in an encoding, such as `application/json; charset=utf-8`. \r\n\r\nCertainly one could ask what the behaviour for parsing parameters should be and what the limits are. But without going into too much specialisation, just adding support for `charset=utf-8` seems like a sufficient and easy extension. For anything more specific likely one needs to implement their own decoder anyways, e.g. to support content-type negotiation and versioning.\r\n\r\nI suggest to either add `application/json; charset=utf-8` for the JSON case, or let `GetRequestContentType` return the individual type parts (such as `top-level type name / [ tree. ] subtype name [ +suffix ] [ ; parameters ]`) and then only match on the top-level type name for now.","closed_by":{"login":"pkieltyka","id":18831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka","html_url":"https://github.com/pkieltyka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkieltyka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-chi/chi/issues/185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-chi/chi/issues/185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
