deserializing a protobuf message, `BeanDeserializer `calls `ProtobufParser.nextFieldName()` in a loop.\r\nFollowing piece of code looks for a field by id, which should be equal to \"index\" from message schema:\r\n```\r\n            int tag = _decodeVInt();\r\n            // inlined _handleRootKey()\r\n\r\n            int wireType = (tag & 0x7);\r\n            int id = (tag >> 3);\r\n\r\n            ProtobufField f = _findField(id);\r\n            if (f == null) {\r\n                if (_skipUnknownField(id, wireType) != JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\r\n                    return null;\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nhere, if `_findField(id)` returns `null ` (in case message contains unknown field), `_skipUnknownField` skips the whole field in the stream.\r\nProblem is that after unknown field is skipped, local variables `tag, wireType, id` are still contain info about skipped field and used directly afterwards, while current field is already next one.\r\n\r\nCalled function `_skipUnknownField(id, wireType)` already reads next fields tag and sets class global variable `_currentField` to next field, so what has to be done in caller's code is to update local variables to next valid field:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            ProtobufField f = _findField(id);\r\n            if (f == null) {\r\n                if (_skipUnknownField(id, wireType) != JsonToken.FIELD_NAME) {\r\n                    return null;\r\n                }\r\n                // sub-optimal as skip method already set it, but:\r\n                \r\n                // update local variables to next field after unknown field is skipped\r\n                tag = _currentField.typedTag;\r\n                wireType = _currentField.wireType;\r\n                id = _currentField.id;\r\n            }\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/202/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
