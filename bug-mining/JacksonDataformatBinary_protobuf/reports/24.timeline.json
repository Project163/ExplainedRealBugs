#598: Separate END_OBJECT return from parser close in ProtobufParser\r\n    \r\nPreviously, ProtobufParser would call close() while simultaneously returning END_OBJECT at the top level, causing the parser to be in a closed state  immediately after returning the final token. This created incompatibility with jackson-core issue #1438.\r\n    \r\nSolution:\r\n    - Added new parser state STATE_ROOT_END to separate the two actions\r\n    - Parser now returns END_OBJECT in STATE_ROOT_END state\r\n    - Parser only closes on the subsequent nextToken() call\r\n    - Updated all methods: nextToken(), nextName(), nextName(SerializableString),\r\n      nextNameMatch(), and _skipUnknownField()\r\n    - Clear current name when transitioning to STATE_ROOT_END\r\n\r\nNOTE: PR created on Claude Code proposed fix.\r\n    ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/626/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20513031508,"node_id":"CE_lADOA3Qg6865HbdAzwAAAATGrAVU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/events/20513031508","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-27T00:34:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20513076585,"node_id":"REFE_lADOA3Qg6865HbdAzwAAAATGrLVp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/events/20513076585","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4b08f7351225d88025904d788ba54b4e79b358ec","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/commits/4b08f7351225d88025904d788ba54b4e79b358ec","created_at":"2025-10-27T00:40:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
