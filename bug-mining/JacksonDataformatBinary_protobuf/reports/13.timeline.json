The only reason I brought up Kotlin is that in Kotlin, it's very easy to make a TypeReference with reified generics in inline functions, whereas it is harder to make a JavaType.\r\n\r\nWith Kotlin: \r\n```\r\ninline fun <reified T : Any> createProducer(topic: String): IProducer<T> {\r\n    val type = object: TypeReference<T>(){}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's as easy as that. However, as T may have generic types, it's not enough to simply say: getSchema(T::class.java), as that will fail. And it's relatively difficult to get a JavaType directly from a refied T : Any. For this reason I ended up converting my TypeReference to a JavaType using constructType, but that isn't an obvious solution. It would be easier if getSchema simply accepted a TypeReference directly. However, it's not a huge deal as it's not hard to convert a TypeReference to a JavaType once you know how.\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm asking for is just an additional method overload for
