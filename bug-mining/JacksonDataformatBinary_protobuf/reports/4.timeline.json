is a preliminary work for the  #78 \"create ProtoSchema from descriptor file\".\r\n\r\nA \"descriptor file\" is a set of descriptors.  A descriptor is a binary representation of the .proto file.  Typically one (or more) of the descriptors is the main, and the others are dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis reader creates a `NativeProtobufSchema` object from the main descriptor.  Dependencies are \"copied\" into the main descriptor before generating the object.  I chose copying over implementing the import mechanism per #86 discussion. The import statement is a potential security risk, and it would certainly add the complexity.  \r\n\r\nThis descriptor reader should work for simple message types that do not have references to other nested message types.  #73 needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\nNote: descriptor.proto was [copied from Google Protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.proto).
