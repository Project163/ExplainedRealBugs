                    <description>&lt;p&gt;If not configured, file install bundle creates ./load when it starts. Either it should not create any directory and wait for user to configure it or it should create a directory in tmp folder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="12853075" author="marrs" created="Sat, 3 Apr 2010 05:10:30 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;If not configured, it&apos;s perfectly fine in general for bundles to assume some kind of defaults and use those. To be honest, I don&apos;t like creating a &quot;load&quot; directory in some kind of temporary folder in that case. Creating the &quot;./load&quot; folder to me is a very reasonable default and I don&apos;t really see a need to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, the only thing you could consider is: should FileInstall create a folder at all? In other words, if &quot;./load&quot; is the default, or whatever other folder is defined, and it does not exist, should FileInstall then create it or simply warn the user that the folder is not there. This would be an API breaking change.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12853084" author="sahoo" created="Sat, 3 Apr 2010 05:53:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I see no point in FileInstall creating ./load. I am not sure how many people rely on this default behavior. May be we can take a poll to decide whether we need to introduce any flag to keep it compatible or not?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="12855295" author="gnt" created="Fri, 9 Apr 2010 06:28:47 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;AFAIK, the real problem is not creating the load directory, it&apos;s about having this directory being watched by default, right ?&lt;br/&gt;
 I think having a way to not have any watched directory by default is a good thing, however we may have users that use this behavior.&lt;br/&gt;
What about introducing a flag to not watch any directory by default ?&lt;br/&gt;
   org.felix.fileinstall.noDefaultWatchDir = false&lt;br/&gt;
or anything similar with a better name &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can always change the default value for the next major / minor version instead of the next micro ....&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12855297" author="sahoo" created="Fri, 9 Apr 2010 06:42:30 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;For me the real problem is creation of ./load. I noticed my file system have many ./load directories and they must have been created because I would have started fileinstall bundle without configuring it properly. I am fine with introducing the flag as you mentioned. IIUC, when the flag is set to false (when not set, it defaults to false), it will take care of not creating the dir as well. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12855300" author="marrs" created="Fri, 9 Apr 2010 06:53:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;So let&apos;s not create any folder (configured or default).&lt;br/&gt;
As far as I&apos;m concerned we can then stick with the default being &quot;load&quot;. I really dislike creating files or folders that are useful for users in /tmp as that is a &quot;scratch&quot; folder for non-human use.&lt;br/&gt;
The user should be warned if the (default or configured) folder does not exist (in which case FileInstall should keep monitoring the filesystem because the user might still create it manually afterwards).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes will break backward compatibility, so we would have to bump the version to 3.0.0 but that&apos;s no problem.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12855301" author="sahoo" created="Fri, 9 Apr 2010 07:09:39 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The above suggestion sounds good to me.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12857718" author="sahoo" created="Fri, 16 Apr 2010 07:12:35 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;A new patch that does not create watchedDir (default or configured) if it does not exist. Instead, it prints a message and continues until the watchedDir is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like someone to look at this patch and apply it soon if it looks OK. I want to call for a release of fileinstall with some of the recent fixes that have been made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assume we no longer need the first submitted patch, so I didn&apos;t commit that. Please let me know if this is incorrect. Otherwise, please close the bug if satisfied. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
