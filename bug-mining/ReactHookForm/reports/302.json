In the `reset()` case, it seems to call `setValueAs` but, the output from it isn't being applied to the input - the raw value given to `reset(value)` is used instead.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to 'https://codesandbox.io/s/stoic-payne-iipg4?file=/src/App.tsx'\r\n2. Verify that the date input is empty - even though the `useEffect` set a value through `reset()`\r\n3. Open Chrome DevTools _(not the Codesandbox one)_ and verify that it prints a warning from the HTML Input element\r\n    e.g. `The specified value \"Wed Jun 16 2021 09:12:17 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)\" does not conform to the required format, \"yyyy-MM-dd\".`\r\n    This indicates that the raw value was applied to the HTML element, not the transformed value.\r\n4. Verify that the number input's display value is `10` (the raw value), not `100` (the `setValueAs` output)\r\n5. Click `submit`\r\n6. Verify that the submit value is the expected one - which is totally different from what's displayed in the input fields\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/stoic-payne-iipg4?file=/src/App.tsx\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nUsing `defaultValues` or `reset()` should produce the same outcome, both visually (input value) and programmatically (submit value).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5627/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
