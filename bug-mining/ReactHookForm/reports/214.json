But NestedValue can't wrap Map.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\nType:\r\n`type MyNestedMap = NestedValue<Map<any, any>>;`\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nI can't get importing of NestedValue to work at all in CodeSandbox.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFor the TypeScript to allow it\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n```\r\nTS2344: Type 'Map<any, any>' does not satisfy the constraint 'unknown[] | Record<string, unknown>'.   Type 'Map<any, any>' is not assignable to type 'Record<string, unknown>'.     Index signature is missing in type 'Map<any, any>'.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116494/101022451-b50c7080-3571-11eb-9f73-234c9e7e7a7a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional Information**\r\n\r\nI think this PR might have caused this to not work anymore.
