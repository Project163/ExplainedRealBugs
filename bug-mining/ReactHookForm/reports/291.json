Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/restless-tree-j60ws\r\n2. Click on \"Toggle Metadata\" so the field is showing\r\n3. Click on \"Reset\", which resets the form and hides the field\r\n4. See error\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/restless-tree-j60ws\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNo error should occur when the field is unmounted immediately after reset.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS Catalina\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Version 91\r\n\r\n**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- Device: Pixel 3\r\n- OS: Android 11\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Version: 91\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'm happy to put out a PR to fix the issue, but I'm not certain of the preferred approach. The most obvious fast fix I see is adding the check for `_f` existence in the cleanup function, but I'm wondering if more support should be added for non-primitive values? Maybe a ref that keeps track of the names of registered fields that we would then reference during `registerAbsentFields` instead of just checking if the field is a primitive value?","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5492/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
