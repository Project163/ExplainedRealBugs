But when you are trying to access to `formState` right when you append a first nested field in a second field it throws an error saying `Uncaught TypeError: get is not a function or its return value is not iterable` \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to the sandbox\r\n2. Click on the add array field button\r\n3. Notice it is working (both, array field and nested array field were appended correctly)\r\n4. Uncomment line `34` that prints `formState`\r\n5. Click on the add array field button\r\n6. It fails with the above-mentioned error.\r\n\r\nExtra: (Hope this extra gives you a clue of what is going on)\r\n1. Uncomment line `34` that prints `formState`\r\n2. Click on the remove button\r\n3. Click on the add array field button, twice\r\n4. It fails with the above-mentioned error on the second try. \r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\n- https://codesandbox.io/s/nested-field-array-deep-append-8d0f8\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt should not fail.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nUsing react-hook-form v6.8.0\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2877/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2877/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
