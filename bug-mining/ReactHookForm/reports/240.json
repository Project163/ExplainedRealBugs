It will become true once the input is blurred, however this is not good if the save button is disabled when !form.isDirty as it prevents the user from submitting the form unless they have blurred the input.\r\n\r\nIf you remove the watch on the form value it works as expected\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCreate a form with a single input and set the submit button to be disabled if !formState.isDirty\r\n\r\n1.  Watch a field with something similar to what is below or in the codeSandbox\r\n```\r\nfunction Form(){\r\n  const { register, formState, watch } = useForm()\r\n  const { isDirty } = formState\r\n\r\n  const name = watch('name')\r\n  return <form>\r\n    <input type='text' {...register('name')} />\r\n    <button type='submit' disabled={!isDirty}>Save</button>\r\n  </form>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2.  Change the field value\r\n3. The submit button will be disabled when it should be enabled\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-useform-template-forked-rpm8c?file=/src/index.js","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4597/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
