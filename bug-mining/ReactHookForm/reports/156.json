When removing the `watch` on the selected item, the `formState.isDirty` changes correctly.\r\n\r\nWhen you downgrade to `6.4.1`, the code works as expected when you select an item from the dropdown. (i.e. the button is not disabled when an item is selected).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/spring-tree-wrk13?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark\r\n2. Click on the first item in the dropdown\r\n3. See that the button remains disabled even though the form is dirty\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/spring-tree-wrk13?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe `formState.isDirty` property should change when clicking on an item in the dropdown field. (in combination with `watch`)\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: OSX Catalina 10.15.6\r\n- Browser Firefox\r\n- Version 80\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2725/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
