Go to CodeSandbox\r\n2. Enter value inside \"name\" field (any non empty string value is okay)\r\n3. Click submit and verify that form is submitted\r\n4. Toggle on/off \"disable\" switch (Input should become grayed out and then normal)\r\n5. Verify that initial value is still inside the field (meaning it should be valid)\r\n6. Click submit and verify that form is invalidated, and \"name\" field is registered as invalid.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nForm submission should be allowed, the value exists. \r\nValue is visible as \"field.value\" inside `ControlledTextField` component, I've left a console.log to verify that as well.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11076/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11076/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
