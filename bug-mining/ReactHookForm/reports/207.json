Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-field-array-w-default-values-iqb4l?file=/src/index.js\r\n2. Open the console\r\n3. Click \"Submit\" to verify the default values shown in the console match the current selections\r\n4. Deselect ID \"3\" and click submit; values are unchanged (`[\"1\", \"3\"]`) when they should be `[\"1\"]`.\r\n5. Refresh\r\n6. Deselect ID \"1\" and click submit; values are `[\"3\", \"3\"]` when they should be `[\"3\"]`\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-field-array-w-default-values-iqb4l?file=/src/index.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nDeselected values should not appear in the array, and there should be no duplicated values.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: MacOS Catalina 10.15.7\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Version: 86.0.4240.183 (Official Build) (x86_64)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nMay be related to #3431. Interestingly, if a new value is selected before deselecting one of the default values, deselecting seems to work as intended for exactly one value. If _two_ new values are selected before deselecting any of the default values, deselecting seems to work as intended for two values. I assume this pattern continues but did not test beyond two.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate using the codesandbox above:\r\n\r\n1) Select \"4\"\r\n2) Deselect \"3\"\r\n3) Click submit; values are `[\"1\", \"4\"]` as expected.","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
