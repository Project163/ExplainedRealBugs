When the user submits, you should get a object containing the fields that were registered and not unregistered. \r\n\r\nIn the latest version of the lib (6.6.0 at the time of writing), the unregister function is ignored/not working.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the code sandbox here: https://codesandbox.io/s/wonderful-raman-4uydv\r\n2. Click multiple times on the button add. For each add click, a console log will be outputed with the action made\r\n3. Click submit to see the current form object. Check that all values are there\r\n4. Click on remove one or more times\r\n5. Click submit and you will se the object exactly as it is in the point 3. At least, the object at this point should not contain the fields called with the unregister method.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/wonderful-raman-4uydv\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhen you call the unregister method, you should not see the unregistered fields on form submit .\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4042283/91586588-82892100-e94d-11ea-8152-46578f6f4eb8.png)\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: windows 10\r\n- Browser: chrome \r\n- Version 84","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2757/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
