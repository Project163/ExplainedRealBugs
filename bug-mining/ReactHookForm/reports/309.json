Go to [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/dry-pine-eyskx?file=/src/App.jsx)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16997894/124546911-2e0dc800-dde0-11eb-89fe-36f84f2f081f.png)\r\n\r\n2.

See bug. At this point, the error message should disappear, but error message only disappears on the next onBlur event.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/dry-pine-eyskx?file=/src/App.jsx\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe error message should disappear when the user inputs 22 and click out.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: [Ubuntu 20.04]\r\n- Browser [chrome]\r\n- Version [90.0.4430.85]\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nCalling trigger after the first validate event fixed the bug, but it would be nice to have a better solution.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16997894/124547777-81cce100-dde1-11eb-8f33-ec57a8447f06.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5857/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
