@gdorsi we used to have `console.warn` in the dev build but it creates noise that some devs like and others don't, hence with v7 we have removed all the warnings. on top of that, striping log and warning is another headache with env, especially we have ESM, UMD, and CJS making build even more difficult. so ideally if we can find the root cause or anyone can reproduce the issue, let's try to
