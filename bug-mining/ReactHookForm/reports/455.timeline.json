have found the same issue, if you just access the isDirty state through `form.formState.isDirty` or at times access is by `formState: { isDirty, errors },` and you don't subscribe to it, it won't set it to dirty which stops my validation to check if we should submit or not.\r\nSimple fix is to just subscribe to it but not sure why it doesn't get set properly","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/2178212045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jacobsamo","id":77374574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3Mzc0NTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77374574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobsamo","html_url":"https://github.com/jacobsamo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobsamo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobsamo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobsamo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobsamo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobsamo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobsamo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobsamo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobsamo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobsamo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/2178234489","html_url":"https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12024#issuecomment-2178234489","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12024","id":2178234489,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCl-cD86B1Th5","user":{"login":"djhi","id":1122076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjIwNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1122076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djhi","html_url":"https://github.com/djhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djhi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-19T09:43:43Z","updated_at":"2024-06-19T09:43:43Z","body":"Unfortunately,
