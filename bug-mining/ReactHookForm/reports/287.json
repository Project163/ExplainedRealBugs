The value is still updated on the actual field.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Add a new field to the form. \r\n2. Fill out the username and company name. The value will update alongside it.\r\n3. Submit the form or check the form state at the bottom. The `company.name` property will remain empty.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\n\r\n- [v7.6.7](https://codesandbox.io/s/beautiful-cdn-rxppq?file=/src/App.js)\r\n- [v7.6.6](https://codesandbox.io/s/silly-poincare-97toh). \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt should remain possible to deeply nest form fields like on the 7.6.6 release.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nOn 7.6.6:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1002245/119827737-c4092580-bef9-11eb-8d79-9cda9129e1aa.png)\r\n\r\nOn 7.6.7:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1002245/119827815-d7b48c00-bef9-11eb-9ace-1449610fb00a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: macos\r\n- Browser chrome\r\n- Version 90\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5361/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
