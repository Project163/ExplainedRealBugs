Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-field-bug-watch-array-fields-bkdj5\r\n2. Type some text in the input field\r\n3. Message \"new field value\" appears in the console\r\n4. Change the react-hook-form dependency to 4.9.9-beta.1 or above\r\n5. Type some text in the field\r\n6. Nothing is logged in the console\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nWorking version (4.9.8): Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-field-bug-watch-array-fields-bkdj5\r\nVersion with issue (4.9.9-beta.1): http://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-field-bug-watch-array-fields-s2qyo \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe watched value should be updated as it used to be in 4.9.8\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
