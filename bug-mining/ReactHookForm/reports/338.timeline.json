Version Number\r\n\r\n7.15.3\r\n\r\n### Codesandbox/Expo snack\r\n\r\nI'm currently unable to reproduce issue in Codesandbox, but I'm going to spend more time trying to reproduce it in the morning. I explain the issue in further detail below.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18515648/135049113-7b307e29-53f3-4f60-89e1-5bc59cfa29ee.png)\r\nThe above change was not backwards compatible, and seemed to have broken the following code of mine:\r\n```\r\nreset(\r\n  {\r\n    filters: filters,\r\n  },\r\n  { keepValues: true }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Steps\r\n1. Make change to form element (i.e. type something in text `<input>`, for example).\r\n2. `isDirty` is set to `true`, triggering a `useEffect`.\r\n3. Invoke the above `reset` snippet within the aforementioned `useEffect`.\r\n4. The form element that was modified should still be focused (blinking cursor should not disappear).\r\n4. Make another change to the same form element. Any further changes **do not** set `isDirty` to `true`, which is not the correct behavior.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nI expect `isDirty` to be set to `true` on any change to the form element, regardless of whether or not the form is `reset` with `{ keepValues: true }`.\r\n\r\nI cannot remove `{ keepValues: true }`, because then the form element loses focus when `reset` is called.\r\n\r\nI had to downgrade to version `7.15.2` for it to work as expected, so version `7.15.3` was where the breaking change was made.\r\n\r\nIn the image that I posted above, you can see that `_formValues` is not set if `keepStateOptions.keepValues` is set to `true`, which is different than the behavior in version `7.15.2`.\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/6659/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/6659/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
