\r\n> please use `validate` function instead, required only check for the empty string.\r\n\r\nMaybe I described it badly. But the thing is that required check considers value as an empty string when it is `0`. So the value is there and `required` validation shouldn't generate an error. In version 6  zero was handled properly.\r\nFrom what I see after quick debug is that in `handleChange` `getFieldValue` is called\r\n```\r\nconst inputValue = inputType ? getFieldValue(field) : value;\r\n```\r\nand it calls `getFieldValueAs`\r\n```\r\nvar getFieldValueAs = (value, { valueAsNumber, valueAsDate, setValueAs }) => valueAsNumber\r\n    ? value === ''\r\n        ?

value is transformed **before validation** and is 0\r\nThen in `validateField`:\r\n```\r\nconst isEmpty = !inputValue || (Array.isArray(inputValue) && !inputValue.length);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom

when it's invoked. The main problem is to properly handle `0` value. In provided by you example everything works as expected  - `0` doesn't cause 'required' error.\r\nBut in codesandbox provided in the description(https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-validation-required-forked-z4mrl?file=/src/App.jsx) it triggers 'required' error even though the value is
