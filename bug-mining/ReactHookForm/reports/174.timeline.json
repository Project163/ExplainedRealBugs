patched by a bug because we used to unset `errors` by `name`, which lead to this unexpected behavior when user just want to clear a single error not an entire node of errors. issue reference: https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2730\r\n- If clear an object key, then yes we should clear the entire error object for that key, if only particular field, we can't assume the other fields in the object doesn't have an error or has, hence set to `undefined1` is the easy and simplest solution. \r\n- why are you checking for errors length? shouldn't you rely on `isVaid`?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/696601726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/696602079","html_url":"https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2961#issuecomment-696602079","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2961","id":696602079,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NjYwMjA3OQ==","user":{"login":"szymonlesisz","id":3435913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzU5MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3435913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymonlesisz","html_url":"https://github.com/szymonlesisz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymonlesisz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymonlesisz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymonlesisz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymonlesisz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymonlesisz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymonlesisz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymonlesisz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymonlesisz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szymonlesisz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-22T09:11:44Z","updated_at":"2020-09-22T09:11:44Z","body":"I've
