Create a form with a nested multi-checkbox type, e.g.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\n      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>\r\n        <label className=\"label\"><input {...register(\"fields.checkbox\")} type=\"checkbox\" name=\"checkbox\" value=\"1\" /> Checkbox one</label>\r\n        <label className=\"label\"><input {...register(\"fields.checkbox\")} type=\"checkbox\" name=\"checkbox\" value=\"2\" /> Checkbox two</label>\r\n        <label className=\"label\"><input {...register(\"fields.checkbox\")} type=\"checkbox\" name=\"checkbox\" value=\"3\" /> Checkbox three</label>\r\n        <label className=\"label\"><input {...register(\"fields.checkbox\")} type=\"checkbox\" name=\"checkbox\" value=\"4\" /> Checkbox four</label>\r\n        <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => setValue(\"fields\", { checkbox: ['1', '3'] })}>Check odd numbers</button>\r\n        <input type=\"submit\" />\r\n      </form>\r\n```\r\n\r\nClick the button to call setValue with the checkbox fields nested inside.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe checkboxes should be checked. The internal value is updated, but the actual form state isn't updated because in `setValue` we call `setValues` instead of `setFieldValue` if the value isn't primitive - this looks like it was only intended to cover plain objects but it also catches arrays. This means that RHF tries to setFieldValue on `fields.checkbox.0` (etc) which won't have a matching _fields ref.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12316/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12316/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
