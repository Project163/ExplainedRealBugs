 so by continuing to dig I narrowed this down to what seems to be a persistent issue around `mode: onBlur` and required radio inputs.  Making the radio inputs not required solves the issue, or changing `mode` to `onChange`.\r\n\r\nI had opened a similar issue before on this topic, never got around to trying to contribute a fix.  For now my work around was the following: \r\n\r\nEnsure only one of each named radio inputs has `ref={register({ required: true })}`\r\nOn each of the radio inputs add an `onChange` handler with the following function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction onRadioChange(e) {\r\n  trigger(e.target.name);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis causes the radio inputs to successfully register as having a value.  `mode: 'onBlur'` simply does not work out of the box with required radio inputs","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/716863968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ErikAGriffin","id":10357979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzU3OTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10357979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErikAGriffin","html_url":"https://github.com/ErikAGriffin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErikAGriffin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErikAGriffin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErikAGriffin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErikAGriffin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErikAGriffin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErikAGriffin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErikAGriffin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErikAGriffin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ErikAGriffin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3923113998,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzkyMzExMzk5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/3923113998","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-26T22:43:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3923114002,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5MjMxMTQwMDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/3923114002","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-26T22:43:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/716868536","html_url":"https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2740#issuecomment-716868536","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2740","id":716868536,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNjg2ODUzNg==","user":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github
