@cztomsik i think i find out the reason why i made the fix previously, please consider to use `reset()` API instead, the problem it creates with defaultValue get re-assigned each time is that cause infinite re-render due to `defaultValue` with `Object.is` comparison inside each re-render. unless we do a deep compare with the defaultValue object, which in my opinion is heavy and increase the package size.
