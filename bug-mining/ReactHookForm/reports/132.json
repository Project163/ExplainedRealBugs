Go to the sandbox link below and change the number value to -1. You will see that this field has an error.\r\n2. Delete this input by clicking on the \"DELETE\" button.\r\n3. Add a new field by clicking on the \"APPEND NESTED\" button.\r\n\r\nYou will see that the error is still there.\r\nSame test can be done with several fields in error.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-nested-arrays-gy89e?from-embed\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe form should revalidate when an item is removed from the fields array and get rid of the errors that point to non existing items.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: MacOS\r\n - Browser chrome\r\n - Version 83.0.4103.116 (Official Build) (64-bit)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nTested in v5.7.2 and v6.0.6\r\nFor more details, I also explained the issue there: https://spectrum.chat/react-hook-form/help/how-to-trigger-validation-on-append-remove~c8b29049-01f1-4abf-998c-26af08b9c133?m=MTU5NDY0NzU4MjMxNA==\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2257/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2257/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
