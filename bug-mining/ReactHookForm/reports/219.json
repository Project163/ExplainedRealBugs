First of all, thanks for this amazing library 🙏  It's my absolute must use when I build forms in react.\r\n\r\nI might be missing something, but it seems to me that `setValue` is somehow buggy when I use it to set a value on a nested array, which is itself inside an object. I tried to simplify the codsandbox the best I could to make it more obvious. The same problem seems to happen with `append` of `useFieldArray`. Am I missing something ?\r\n\r\n```\r\n            setValue(\"obj.test\", [\r\n              {\r\n                name: \"append\",\r\n                nestedArray: [{ field1: \"append\", field2: \"append\" }]  // <---- this line is ignored\r\n              }\r\n            ]);\r\n```\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-nested-arrays-forked-2f8vg?file=/src/index.js\r\n\r\nNote that if I remove `obj.` from my form/data structure, everything works just fine.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3696/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
