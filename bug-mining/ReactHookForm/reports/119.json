If you have several inputs on your page and one of them has an error, all triggerValidation() requests will return false, even if you only send them for one specific field.\r\n\r\ne.g: you habe firstname and surname. There is an error in firstname. If I now use triggerValidation(surname), it will return false, even if the value for surname is correct. It also (correctly) sets no error for surname.\r\n\r\nCodeSandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-validationschema-3reg3?file=/src/index.js:426-442\r\n\r\nclick on \"senden\" to trigger errors, then change firstname and trigger validation on blur. You can see the different behaviour if you acitvate or deactivate 'validationSchema: SignupSchema' in line 20.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to change that behaviour?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAnja\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1996/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
