The fieldarray seems to be missing items for a period of time until you trigger a re-render. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Using this sandbox https://codesandbox.io/s/tabs-with-nested-field-array-ci2bz?file=/demo.tsx\r\n2. Click Append Page then select the new page tab.\r\n3. Click Append Sub Page a couple of times.\r\n4. Click the first tab and then click the second tab again. All the sub pages have disappeared.\r\n5. Click Add sub page again (on the second tab) you will now see all the previous created sub pages and the new one\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/tabs-with-nested-field-array-ci2bz?file=/demo.tsx\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nOn revisiting a tab the correct items should be displayed.\r\n\r\n**Desktop :**\r\n\r\n- OS: Windows\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Version: 89\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWe did take a look at the tabbed form example.  But we want our users to freely move between tabs and submit as a whole rather than it being a wizard style form.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4812/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
