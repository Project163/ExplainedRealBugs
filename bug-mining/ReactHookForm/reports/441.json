Go to Example1\r\n2. See the types comparison between `useWatch<Form>()` and `useFormContext<Form>()`\r\n3. Go to Example2\r\n4. See the workaround that gets rid of the deep partial\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\nUsing `useWatch<T>()` (without providing any parameters) returns a deep partial unlike the watch type from `useFormContext`. This results in having to either cast the result to the non-partial value (`T`) or @ts-ignore the type in order to get my defined type instead of the deep partial one.\r\n\r\nI can't actually just use the `useFormContext#watch` because that results in infinite updates when I try to use it the same way I use `useWatch` and gives me performance issues so I've moved away from using it even though the typing there is what I need.\r\n\r\nYou can see the `Example2` file for the usage of a nested property to avoid getting deep partials. \n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI expect that the types would be the same between the two. Unless it's some design decision for some specific case, to me it doesn't make sense for it to be a deep partial. \n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/10734/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/10734/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
