you were expecting:**\r\n* if no input is changed the form should still be not dirty\r\n\r\n**What happened instead:**\r\n* `isDirty` property using the `useFormState()` hook from react-hook-form is set to `true`\r\n* for the initial rendering `isDirty` is still `false` but becomes `true` in the following renderings (see console output in the sandbox)\r\n* the `dirtyFields` are still empty as expected\r\n* in the `defaultValues` the source of the ArrayInput `groups` disappears after the first rendering (see console output in the sandbox)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n* open the code sandbox\r\n* open the console \r\n* reload the page\r\n\r\n**Related code:**\r\n* Code sandbox with minimal example:
