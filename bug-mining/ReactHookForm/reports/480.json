Go to [codesandbox link](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/angry-fermi-ssm9j8)\n2. Click on Submit\n3. Both the text and array fields have errors\n4. Click on toggle text field\n5. The form-state is updated and there are no errors for the text field\n6. Click on toggle array\n7. Array field errors are still present on the form-state\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nArray field errors should not be present on form state when array field is not mounted. I could use the `shouldUnregister` parameter on the `useArrayField` hook but for my use case I need to keep the array values on the form when the array field is unmounted.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12680/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
