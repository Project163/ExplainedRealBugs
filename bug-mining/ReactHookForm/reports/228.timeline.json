the bug**\r\nThe PR #4023 changes what kind of value is being passed to `validate` function as it introduces new boolean flag `shouldKeepRawValue` which now forces `validate` fn to get the raw value, instead of whatever value it would get before (even one from `setValueAs`.\r\n\r\nHence, any component that uses custom validate function and also some of the valueAs functionality breaks, because it's getting raw value now rather than the parsed one - this is clearly a BC, as it breaks the contract established before.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nPseudocode below. \r\n\r\nImagine input `abc`\r\n\r\nIn version `6.14.2`\r\n\r\n```\r\n<AnyFormComponent\r\n  validate={val => /* val here is cba */}\r\n  setValueAs={val => 'cba'} /* map any input to cba */\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn version `6.15.0` (very next release of minor version change)\r\n\r\n```\r\n<AnyFormComponent\r\n  validate={val => /* val here is abc */} ← DIFFERENCE HERE\r\n  setValueAs={val => 'cba'} /* map any input to cba */\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe new behaviour should be released as new MAJOR version and any `16.*` should keep the old behaviour, or make this new behaviour configurable\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4151/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4151/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-15T05:21:59Z","updated_at":"2021-03-15T05:21:59Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CreateThrive/react-firebase-admin/issues/300","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CreateThrive/react-firebase-admin","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CreateThrive/react-firebase-admin/issues/300/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CreateThrive/react-firebase-admin/issues/300/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CreateThrive/react-firebase-admin/issues/300/events","html_url":"https://github.com/CreateThrive/react-firebase-admin/pull/300","id":831425248,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTkyNzQ2MjMy","number":300,"title":"Bump
