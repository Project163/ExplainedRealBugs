In the codesandbox i am console logging all watched values out.  Any changes from the form field values should be reflected in that watch method, including the modified values in `useFieldArray` but in this case the values are not accurate.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to the codesandbox\r\n2. open console\r\n3. Click `append`\r\n4. Then click `delete twice`\r\n5. See error `Object {test: Array[3]}` (it should be a length of 2)\r\n6. Click `append` again.\r\n7. See that the array index is one behind now.\r\n8. Delete all items and see there is still an array of 3.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/issue-usefieldarray-watch-broken-kph9x\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhen fields are modified from `useFieldArray`, the `watch` method should reflect the same modified array.  This way we are able to get the subscribe to the values externally for our needs.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Mac\r\n - Browser: chrome\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThe reason we need this to work is for using the watch method combined with `useEffect` to dispatch changes to a context provider so the user can see a _live update_ of their form.  In our case, we don't want to manually setup onChange events for every field but watch/subscribe to all fields and update our context so we can display the live information elsewhere.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1336/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1336/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
