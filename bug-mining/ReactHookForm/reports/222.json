When using a checkbox this needs to be clicked twice to update the dirtyFields.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the sandbox and show the console\r\n2. Click on the move button\r\n3. Notice an empty dirtyFields object in the logs\r\n3. Uncheck the checked checkbox\r\n4. Notice no log for dirtyFields in the console\r\n4. Check the same checkbox again\r\n5. Notice only this checked attribute in the dirtyFields and not the name attributes\r\n6. Touch a name field and loose focus again\r\n7. Notice this name field shows up in the dirtyFields\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nInclude a codesandbox will help us to investigate the issue quicker.\r\n\r\n- [https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-forked-lsw6z](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-forked-lsw6z)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe dirtyFields object is updated when moving fieldArray fields based on the defaultValue of the fieldArray.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS Catalina v10.15.7\r\n- Browser: Google Chrome Version 87.0.4280.88\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nUsing react-hook-form v6.14.0\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
