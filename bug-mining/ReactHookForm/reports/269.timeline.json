#4994\r\n\r\nFor reference, [here is the sandbox that shows the issue](https://codesandbox.io/s/cranky-kapitsa-3sd8m?file=/src/App.tsx:500-549)\r\n\r\nAs explained in the issue mentioned above, this PR make use of [TS variadic tuple types](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/39094) to extract the proper type of the tuple returned by `watch` & `getValues` \r\n\r\nTo avoid any potential breaking changes on `watch` type definition, I've kept the [previously defined signatures](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/pull/4721).\r\n____\r\n\r\n#### The behaviour if this gets merged would be as follow\r\n\r\n- `getValues`:\r\n```ts\r\ntype MyFormValues = {\r\n    k1: string;\r\n    ...,\r\n    kN: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Previously resolved to (string | ... | number)[]\r\nconst ['k1', ..., 'kN'] = getValues(['k1', ..., 'kN']);\r\n\r\n// With this PR, resolved to [string, ..., number]\r\nconst ['k1', ..., 'kN'] = getValues(['k1', ..., 'kN']);\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\n- `watch`:\r\n```ts\r\ntype MyFormValues = {\r\n    k1: string;\r\n    ...,\r\n    k10: boolean,\r\n    ...,\r\n    kN: number;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Previously resolved to (string | number | ...)[]\r\nconst [k1, ..., kN] = watch(['k1', ..., 'kN']);\r\n\r\n// With this PR, all of the following calls resolved to [string, ..., number]\r\nconst [k1, ..., kN] = watch(['k1', ..., 'kN']);\r\nconst [k1, ..., kN] = watch<['k1', ..., 'kN']>(['k1', ..., 'kN']);\r\n\r\n// To avoid any breaking changes, this call resolved to [string, ..., boolean] as prior to this PR\r\n// The limit for this syntax still being at 10 keys\r\nconst [k1, ..., k10] = watch<'k1', ..., 'k10'>(['k1', ..., 'k10']);\r\n``` \r\n____\r\n\r\n**_Ps_**: First time contributing to an open source project, happy
