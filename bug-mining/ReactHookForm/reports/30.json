Open Example Sandbox\r\n2. Add one friend\r\n3. Submit the form\r\n4. Type in negative number into age field\r\n5. Type positive number and change it to negative using arrow keys\r\n\r\nValidating numbers below minimum value is triggered only on filled inputs (for example when you change from `2` to `-1` using arrow keys). But when the field is empty errors with type min are not present. **They appear after submiting form again**\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-array-fields-m2z0x\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNumbers below mininum value should always be validated\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27491471/71890381-70e7d480-3144-11ea-832e-7a77526043aa.png)\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windowxs 10\r\n - Browser: Brave\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/793/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
