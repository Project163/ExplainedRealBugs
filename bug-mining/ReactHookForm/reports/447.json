Load sandbox and watch state output above the form\r\n1. validatingFields includes \"undefined\" as a validating field name\r\n1. this is caused by the `trigger()` call inside the `useEffect` callback\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nNot sure if this is intentional or if I am doing something wrong here. But I came across this in my current application after updating to the newest version 7.51.0 which introduced this field. \r\n\r\nThe issue in my code was that `isValidating` has never been reset to false. I solved it in my app but might lead to other bugs elsewhere if the `\"undefined\": true` bit is added unintentionally.  \r\n\r\n\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\"validatingFields\": {\r\n    \"undefined\": true\r\n  }\n```\n\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11621/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
