Instead, the fields are somehow being replaced with empty fields while maintaining the same array length. Also, the field id `undefined` for the new fields.\r\n\r\nI created a minimal CodeSandbox to demonstrate the bug:\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the CodeSandbox provided below.\r\n2. Click on add child.\r\n3. Click on remove child.\r\n4. The child is not removed and react will show a warning saying `Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique \"key\" prop.`\r\n5. downgrade to version 6.15.1\r\n6. add children and nested children and remove them.\r\n7. notice how no errors are shown and that remove is behaving as expected!\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/hook-form-nested-field-array-t4m3g?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nRemove should behave like it did before on earlier versions.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS\r\n- Chrome 88\r\n- 6.15.3\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI might be wrong, but I think this is related to #4172\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4259/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4259/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
