your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nwhen I get response after submitting a form, I get two types of errors: a) field related errors, which can be handled by `setError` b)  some global errors, like user not found. there is no place for this kind of errors in `react-hook-form`\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nthere can be a field starting with dangle (_) to used as global error for the form.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nNow I use a custom field named `_error`, but typescript keeps complaining about it, as there is no `_error` field in my inputs.\r\nanother workaround was to use a local state.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nin `redux-form` we could use `_error` field for global errors. and it's handled nicely providing a prop named `error`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/7661/reactions","total_count":51,"+1":46,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":5},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/7661/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8397729504,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCl-cD85dOF3KzwAAAAH0iy7g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/8397729504","actor":{"login":"imaksp","id":2557058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTcwNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2557058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp","html_url":"https://github.com/imaksp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-31T10:17:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8397729515,"node_id":"SE_lADOCl-cD85dOF3KzwAAAAH0iy7r","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/8397729515","actor":{"login":"imaksp","id":2557058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NTcwNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2557058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp","html_url":"https://github.com/imaksp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imaksp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-31T10:17:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8397730300,"node_id":"LE_lADOCl-cD85dOF3KzwAAAAH0izH8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/8397730300","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-31T10:18:02Z","label":{"name":"status:
