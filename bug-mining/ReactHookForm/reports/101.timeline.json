@bluebill1049 and thank you for reaching out again! i was able to use the umd file as-is from the current version by modifying our build process slightly, similar to the replace that you're doing in

It's good to see lib authors committed to their projects and gives a lot of confidence in choosing this package. Take care 👍

the bug**\r\nThe ES6 module build includes references to `process.env.NODE_ENV`, which breaks browser usages -- browsers now support ES6 modules. This is hidden by `react-scripts` in Codesandbox.io because it provides a definition for process.env.NODE_ENV.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Use Rollup to create an ES6 module build that runs in the browser.\r\n2. Pass `register` to the `ref` prop as done in just about every example.\r\n3. Run the code in the browser.\r\n4. Open the JS console and note the \"process is not defined\" error.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nI flipped a table trying to get Codesandbox to **not** use create-react-app. I hope you don't mind if I just created a dedicated repo with reproduction instructions in the README:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spaceaardvark/react-hook-form-bug1\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe browser build should not encounter or use process.env.NODE_ENV.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: Ubuntu 20\r\n- Chrome\r\n- v86.0.4240.198\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nFrom conversation in #1441 after it was closed.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3498/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7585854127,"node_id":"LOE_lADOCl-cD84j48YUzwAAAAHEJvKv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/7585854127","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-14T00:02:37Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
