So, after changing tags, the \"reset\" button should basically do nothing to the form or the values logged to the console (only updating default values), but the console log is incorrect in this fork.  It is like it returns the default value, not the current value.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/1881610319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"IanVS","id":4616705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MTY3MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4616705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanVS","html_url":"https://github.com/IanVS","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanVS/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanVS/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanVS/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanVS/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanVS/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanVS/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanVS/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanVS/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IanVS/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11421120097,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCl-cD857akvizwAAAAKowHZh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/11421120097","actor":{"login":"Moshyfawn","id":16290753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjkwNzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16290753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn","html_url":"https://github.com/Moshyfawn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-08T18:26:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11421120106,"node_id":"SE_lADOCl-cD857akvizwAAAAKowHZq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/11421120106","actor":{"login":"Moshyfawn","id":16290753,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjkwNzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16290753?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn","html_url":"https://github.com/Moshyfawn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moshyfawn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-08T18:26:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/1884716349","html_url":"https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11368#issuecomment-1884716349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11368","id":1884716349,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCl-cD85wVn09","user":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin

@IanVS I couldn't reproduce the issue (with your steps), could you share a video?\r\n\r\nThe codesandbox that Ian linked to is my codesandbox that I've shared with them. I've modified it again to suit Ian's use-case; you can now reproduce the problem.\r\n\r\nHere's the screencast too. Note that after the form is reset, there is a re-render that forces the values to be logged, but they don't update to the values in the form. The above `tags` list in the app never changes from default values.\r\n\r\nI've tracked it down to how [the `values` are composed](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/blob/75cab7f0a944770170e0773a19b5510d6c1884bb/src/logic/createFormControl.ts#L858C1-L861C7), possibly due to [how `_state.mount` is calculated](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/blob/75cab7f0a944770170e0773a19b5510d6c1884bb/src/logic/createFormControl.ts#L1252C1-L1253C1), where `_proxyFormState.isValid` equals `\"all\"` and we never pass `keepStateOptions.keepIsValid`, so [`_state.mount` is `false`](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/blob/75cab7f0a944770170e0773a19b5510d6c1884bb/src/logic/createFormControl.ts#L860C11-L860C23), hence no
