Go to https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/calc-forked-93m7f3?workspaceId=3123472d-a31f-4ddf-a4e0-79c596270dc0\r\n2. The form should show a cart with 3 items, each of which has one or more variants. This uses two nested field arrays. \r\n3. Click on any of the \"Delete Item\" buttons to remove a row\r\n4. See the error message at the bottom of the form: \"The form is invalid\". \r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nWhen removing a row, react-hook-form should not validate the inputs of that row anymore. Yet it does: if you look at the console, you will see that it tries to validate 'cart.2.variants' field, which is undefined as soon as we've removed a row. The error message should not appear in this case. \r\n\r\n*Note*: The problem only seems to occur if we use a `rules: { validate }` in the nested array field. It doesn't occur if we use a `rules: { required }`.\r\n\r\n*Note*: I've checked that this is not the same bug as https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12291, as the sandbox uses react-hook-form v7.53.1, where this bug is supposed to be fixed. \r\n\r\nThis problem was originally noticed on react-admin (see https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/issues/9961)\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nFirefox, Chrome, Safari, Edge\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12385/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12385/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
