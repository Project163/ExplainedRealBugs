Go to [https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-reset-form-5kmfu](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-reset-form-5kmfu)\r\n2. open the console to see the initialized fields' values\r\n3. Click on \"Reset\" button\r\n4. Look on the console again and see the fields' values after reset (It changes the input values but not what the `watch` and `getValues` return )\r\n\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-reset-form-5kmfu\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhen resetting the form with new default values, I expect the values  coming from `watch` and `getValues` to be the new default values\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/752/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
