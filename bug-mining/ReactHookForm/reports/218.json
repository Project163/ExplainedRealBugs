Works fine in the 6.13 build used by the default CSB (see link below), but does not work on the latest 6.13 from the npm repository.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the default example [csb](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-nested-arrays-lo2er)\r\n2. Click 'update' on the react-hook-form library (important). Everything works fine with the build used in this CSB by default.\r\n3. Modify (or not, does not matter) the first main element.\r\n4. Add another parent element, add one nested element to it.\r\n5. Remove first parent element.\r\n6. Try adding more nested elements to the only remaining parent element in the list.\r\n7. All previously present nested elements will lose their id. Only the last nested element will have an id, which will change on each append. Other elements in the nested list will have `id: undefined`.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-nested-arrays-lo2er\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNew nested elements always receive an id on append, the previous nested elements do not lose their id.","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
