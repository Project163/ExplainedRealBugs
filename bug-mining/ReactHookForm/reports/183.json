This is a regression from v6.8.6, and I think it is due to https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/pull/3062/files\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface FormValues {\r\n  name: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\nuseForm<FormValues>({\r\n  defaultValues: {\r\n    name: Math.random() < 0.5 ? \"\" : undefined,\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will give the compile error: `Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.`\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface FormValues {\r\n  name: string;\r\n}\r\n\r\nuseForm<FormValues>({\r\n  defaultValues: {\r\n    name: \"\",\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will give the compile error: `Property 'location' is missing in type '{ name: string; }' but required in type 'FormValues'.`\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\n\r\nI forked the `useForm` Codesandbox link and switched it to using TypeScript and newer dependencies. However, I was unable to reproduce the compile issue with Codesandbox, which is a bit confusing.\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-useform-template-forked-pqgkx?file=/src/index.tsx is my codesandbox that confusingly does _not_ show the issue. I'm happy to close this bug report if there's something wrong with my setup, but I can't figure out what is different between my setup and the codesandbox that causes it to only break for me locally.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n`defaultValues` that omit some properties of T, or provide a `U | undefined` for a property of T that is of type U, should be accepted.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS 10.15.7\r\n- Browser: not applicable\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nMy local compilation process is triggered by `react-scripts start` ([react-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts))\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3088/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3088/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
