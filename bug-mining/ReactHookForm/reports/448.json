Version `7.51.0` does not have this problem.   I haven't been able to determine exactly what triggers the bug, but I _suspect_ that having a nested field (`preferences.theme` in my sandbox example) has something to do with it because I can't reproduce it with the `name` field alone.\r\n\r\n1. Go to the [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-hook-form-isvalidating-stuck-7-51-1-w9p44c?file=%2Fsrc%2FUserForm.tsx%3A32%2C1)\r\n2. Observe that `isValidating` is `true` immediately upon loading, and no amount of form input will change it to `false`.  The button will remain disabled until `isValidating` is `false`, `isValid` is `true`, and `isDirty` is `true`.  The form state is output on screen and in the console.\r\n3. Roll back the version of `react-hook-form` from `7.51.1` to `7.51.0` in `package.json`, and observe that `isValidating` is now `false` on initial load, and that changing the values of the form field causes the submit button to become enabled.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n`isValidating` should be `false` once the initial validation completes.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nSubmitButton::enabled: false {isDirty: false, isSubmitting: false, isValid: true, isValidating: true}\r\n```\n```\n\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11719/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11719/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
