Please make a click on `Heading2` checkbox.\r\n- Please note that `isDirty` flag was not changed, but form values under that flag were changed.\r\n![isDirty gif](https://github.com/Travellerme/react-hook-form-isDirty-issue/raw/master/isDirty-fail.gif?raw=true \"isDirty\")\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\n[Codesandbox:](https://codesandbox.io/s/flamboyant-oskar-cevsn)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n- `isDirty` should be changed to true if values form were changed or there should be a flag that allows to set up such behavior during the initialization `useFieldArray`. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![isDirty gif](https://github.com/Travellerme/react-hook-form-isDirty-issue/raw/master/isDirty-fail.gif?raw=true \"isDirty\")\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- Windows 10 / Ubuntu / OS:\r\n- Browser Chrome / Firefox / Safari\r\n- Version 88.0.4324.150 / 85.0 / 13.1 (15609.1.20.111.8)\r\n\r\n**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- was not tested\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue is reproducible only by using `useFieldArray`\r\n\r\nThank you \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4170/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4170/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
