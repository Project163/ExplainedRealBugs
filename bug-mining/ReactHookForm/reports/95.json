I'm trying to add few top-level items, then nested-level items. And then to remove some of them. Some of values are reset to defaults. So seems like it works incorrectly.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to provided CSB example\r\n2. Click on append, fill name input\r\n3. Click on appendNested, fill name input\r\n4. Click on top-level append again and delete it.\r\n5. Nested input of first append has been reset.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/blue-star-w0kyz\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nValues shoudn't reset to defaults after removing some items from field array.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: macOS\r\n - Browser Chrome\r\n - Version 80.0.3987.163\r\n - react-hook-form version: 5.4.1","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1408/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1408/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
