However, the schema passed as an argument is the original one and it validates all the fields, not just the changed ones. So the resolver returns an error, but it should not. \r\n\r\nHere's an example: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-forked-bltsh?file=/src/index.js\r\n\r\nIf you add a new field by clicking 'APPEND' the resolver will returns an error as the required field 'age' is not part of the data. But the form is actually valid. \r\n\r\nIs this supposed to be supported or I should write a custom resolver in this case?","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3082/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3082/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
