Since this issue involves using react-hook-form with react-navigation, I'm not entirely sure where the problem is. But since the error is produced by react-hook-form, I thought it might worth creating an issue here.\r\n\r\n1. Go to [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-reset-usefieldarray-forked-yk7g4?file=/src/index.js)\r\n2. Click on 'Append'\r\n3. Click on 'Back'\r\n4. See error\r\n\r\nNote: this sandbox is based on the field array example from [here](https://react-hook-form.com/api/usefieldarray). If you click on 'RESET' instead of 'Back', the form works as expected.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nField array should be reset to an empty array when \"Back\" is clicked, just like clicking on \"RESET\" does.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nTypeError\r\nCannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')\r\neval\r\nhttps://yk7g4.csb.app/node_modules/react-hook-form/dist/index.cjs.js:1:5182\r\nX\r\nhttps://yk7g4.csb.app/node_modules/react-hook-form/dist/index.cjs.js:1:5143\r\nObject.callback [as next]\r\nhttps://yk7g4.csb.app/node_modules/react-hook-form/dist/index.cjs.js:1:21597\r\nObject.next\r\nhttps://yk7g4.csb.app/node_modules/react-hook-form/dist/index.cjs.js:1:6002\r\nreset\r\nhttps://yk7g4.csb.app/node_modules/react-hook-form/dist/index.cjs.js:1:19817\r\nonPress\r\n/src/index.js:33:22\n```\n\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/7268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/7268/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
