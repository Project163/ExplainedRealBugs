Go to the stackblitz demo\r\n2. The first component is the one with an issue, where the watch value remains `undefined`\r\n3. All 3 components rendered follow the same scenario:\r\n    - Every component has a `useQuery` hook that fetches data on a delay (this shouldn't matter)\r\n    - Every component uses `watch` on the text field `test`\r\n    - A very specific scenario where `useFormState` destructures both `isSubmitSuccessful` and `isSubmitting` will not update the watch state\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe watched value should be updated in all cases.\r\n\r\n- Another observation is that this only happens if I'm using `useController`, using a regular `<input {...methods.register(\"test\")} />` wouldn't have this issue\r\n- Unless intended, this is a regression from 4.47.0, you can change the version and try it for yourself\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11229/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
