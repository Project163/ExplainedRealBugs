The `isValid` is initially false, despite all the values are correctly set. If I move back to `3.28.10-beta.1` or `3.28.9` it works. Unfortunately I can't do a reproducible codesandbox since the final version is not yet selectable there. Anyways I did an exact replicate of my setup in codesandbox, which will fail in the final `3.28.10` version as soon at is selectable there.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/delicate-rain-pehsz\r\n2. See that the submit button is initially disabled because the form is invalid\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/delicate-rain-pehsz\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe form should be initially valid: `isValid === true`\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Win10 1909\r\n - Browser Chromium Edge\r\n - Version 80.0.346.0\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIf I hit `triggerValidation` directly after init, it will get valid, but again, only in the final `3.28.10` version which is - at the time of writing - _not_ selectable in codesandbox","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
