Open sandbox\r\n2. Edit textfield (optional). Notice that isDirty correctly sets to true.\r\n3. Click \"Reset\".\r\n4. Editing textfield will not set isDirty to true anymore.\r\n\r\n- Looks like this behavior was Introduced in 7.51.0.\r\n- If isSubmitting and isValid are removed from the code, it seems that isDirty behaves as expected. This implies that the erroneous behavior of isDirty may be introduced while reading other parts of the formState.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nisDirty should be true when value differs from default.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nFirefox, Chrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
