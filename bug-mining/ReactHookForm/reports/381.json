Fill first name and last name\r\n2. Submit\r\n3. Note that the form object is in the following form: {\"contact\": { \"fields\": [\"last name here\", \"first name here\"]}}\r\n4. click in the button \"UNREGISTER FIRST NAME\". The field should be gone and unregistered.\r\n5. The last name should be unchanged.\r\n6. Click submit.\r\n7. The alert shows a empty object.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nAfter unregistering the first name field, and submitting the form, the last name field should be kept untouched, but it isn't. The resulting submit should produce something like this:\r\n\r\n{\"contact\": { \"fields\": [\"last name here\"]}}\r\n\r\nI forked the codesanbox present in https://react-hook-form.com/api/useform/unregister, and using the version 7.2.2 with these modifications, it works as expected.\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/7960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/7960/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
