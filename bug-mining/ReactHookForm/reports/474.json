Go to 'Codesandbox'\n2. check the \"Is input disabled\" checkbox\n3. click \"submit\" button\n4. The disabled field value is not omitted from the submission data.\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nDisabled field values should be omitted from the submission data.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n\n### More Info\n\nWhen using a resolver in `useForm`, the `disabled` prop of `Controller` and `register(..., {disabled})` is not functioning as expected. \n\nI read the source code and found that in `createFormControl.ts` `handleSubmit` function, \n`fieldValues` is created from `_formValues`, and then disabled values are removed. \nHowever, if a resolver exists, it uses `_formValues` instead of the processed `fieldValues`, causing the disabled values to reappear in the submission data.\n\n### Possible Fix\nRefer to [commit](https://github.com/meouwu-dev/react-hook-form/commit/fe14337048de6836dbcf9514261d40f582183cf0). \nThe solution involves passing `fieldValues` to `_runSchema(name)` instead of using `_formValues`.\n\nI am happy to create a pull request.
