I hope you are doing well!\r\n\r\nThe form does not remove the data but the UI elements are removed when using `useFieldArray` after a `reset` has been done on the form. If I provide the data as `defaultValues` instead of the reset, when I remove an item, it works as intended.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. After the form has loaded, hit submit.\r\n2. You will see that there are 3 items in the array in the console log of the form data.\r\n3. Delete an item and hit submit again and you will see 3 items still in the array in the console.log.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-nested-arrays-cku66?file=/src/index.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expect when the UI changes, I hit remove on an element, after I hit submit it reflects what is actually on the form.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nOriginally I thought the `reset` was just like providing `defaultValues` to the form but it seems to act completely different. `reset` actually seems to register data differently with the form than using `defaultValues`\r\n\r\nIf I need to be more clear in my context let me know. Also, for some reason append and prepend do work, just not remove. Those only work after I call register after the reset.","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2240/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2240/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
