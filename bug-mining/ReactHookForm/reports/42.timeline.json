It works correctly if you remove uncomment the line.\r\n\r\nConfirmed this works in my local code.  I'm almost certain I had `defaultValue`  set before and the bug was still present, but I've been hacking away on my code in different areas, so it's likely I missed when the break occurred.   I upgraded from 4.5.6 to 4.6.2 in the process of making these changes.  It's possible setting `defaultValue` didn't work as expected in the earlier version. \r\n\r\nNot completely sure why `defaultValue` was commented out.  The codesandbox is one linked from the official docs [here](https://react-hook-form.com/api#useFieldArray) (the codesandbox link in the second code block under `useFieldArray`). \r\n\r\nThanks for

Thanks for the update and the explanation.  I'm OK with using `defaultValue` as a way to get this to work, however I can't imagine a real-world scenario where the default behavior seems desired.  Removing an item completely clears the array inputs.   It doesn't reset back to the `defaultValues` at the form level. \r\n\r\nTo be sure I'm understanding you, [this behavior](https://streamable.com/eq71w) is the expected behavior if you don't set `defaultValue` on the input?  It's 100% possible I'm misunderstanding [your previous comment](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/892#issuecomment-577991119). If an end-user is entering a list of 10 items, and decides to remove one, _all_ values will be cleared. \r\n\r\nP.S. Feel free to close this and move on if you consider this working as expected.  I have a sufficient workaround.  👍

appears to behave the same way 😢.  I feel like I'm taking up too much of your time with this, since I have a workaround.  I also have a sneaking suspicion, we might have our wires crossed and the workaround isn't a workaround at all, but the correct way to use the field array hook.  \r\n\r\nTo sum it up:\r\n* [This codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-23851) perfectly demonstrates the default behavior with the suggested use, and the behavior when you uncomment `defaultValue` on the input.  Without `defaultValue` set on the input, `append` doesn't actually set the input value and removing an item clears the form.\r\n* You need to set `defaultValues` (plural) at the form level (`useForm`) _and_ `defaultValue`  the input level (`<input defaultValue={field.value} />`) for `useFieldArray` to work reasonably well (e.g. not delete a users previously entered content).  \r\n* This doesn't appear to have any negative drawbacks, and it's almost as if it's the intended use.  If this is the case, nothing is broken and all is right.  \r\n* My confusion stems from your comment discouraging adding `defaultValue` at the input level.  Even if it's set to the values passed in with `fields`.  Without doing this, the behavior appears to be broken.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time and have a great weekend! 🍻\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/578435234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"caged","id":25,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caged","html_url":"https://github.com/caged","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caged/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caged/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caged/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caged/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caged/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caged/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caged/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caged/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caged/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
