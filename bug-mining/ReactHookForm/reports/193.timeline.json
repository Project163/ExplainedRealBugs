@bluebill1049 , first of all, thanks for this amazing library, it's been a real pleasure working with it so far.\r\nHowever recently, we've faced with a minor issue, which affects logic of our apps\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\nAs of version 6.14.0 the logic behind `dirtyFields` and `isDirty` from `useForm / useFormContext` seems to be changed quite drastically.\r\n\r\nBefore 6.14.0 it worked in a following way:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24420540/104209027-de0a0600-5439-11eb-984b-8f58ca56f14f.mov\r\n\r\nBut, from 6.14.0 it started working in a completely different way:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24420540/104209207-14e01c00-543a-11eb-9000-d4f900abeff3.mov\r\n\r\nSo, previously we relayed on this behaviour in order to define if user changed anything in the form in order to prevent accidental redirects\r\n\r\nWas it an intentional change of behaviour? \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behaviour:\r\n\r\n1. Go [to](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-forms-6140-dirty-computation-inconsistency-z0gi7)\r\n2. Make sure you are using version 6.14.0 or 6.14.1 (the most recent once, at the time of bug report)\r\n3. Enter any value in one of the fields\r\n4. Check that output for \"DirtyField\" shows `true` for the altered field\r\n5. Clean the touched field\r\n6. Check that output for \"DirtyField\" still shows previous state\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour**\r\nOn step 6 \"DirtyField\" the altered field should be removed from the list of `dirtyField`\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: MacOS Big Sur 11.1\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Version: 87\r\n\r\nIf you need any additional info about the reported issue, please, let me know\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3873/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3873/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7585856368,"node_id":"LOE_lADOCl-cD84rc1snzwAAAAHEJvtw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/7585856368","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-14T00:03:04Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
