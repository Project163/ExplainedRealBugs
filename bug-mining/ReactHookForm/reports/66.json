In contrast, `watch()` returns proper values. Looks that it is broken since `4.8.3-beta.1` (`4.8.2` works properly).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-rhfinput-cv427\r\n2. Click on `Reset form`.\r\n4. See the console. The first object shows defaultValues (result of `watch()`) and the second object is empty (result of `getValues()`)\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-rhfinput-cv427\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`getValues()` should return default values after form reset.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: macOS\r\n - Browser chrome\r\n - Version latest\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1141/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1141/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
