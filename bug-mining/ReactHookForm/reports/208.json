Go to the sandbox\r\n1. Click **Remove Item** for any of the items in the **fruit** order\r\n1. Neither _dirtyFields_ or _isDirty_ are updated\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-nested-usefieldarray-omqm2?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nDirty state tracked by _isDirty_ and _dirtyFields_ should update when a nested array item is removed.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: Windows 10, MacOS\r\n- Browser Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari\r\n\r\n**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- None\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- Dirty state is updated if you delete any of the orders from the sandbox example. The issue is only with the nested _items_ array. \r\n- The _isDirty_ flag was updated for nested arrays in v6.10.1 but not in v6.11.3.\r\n- If you delete all of the items from a nested array _isDirty_ is set to true but then gets changed back to false if you touch any other field without making a change\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3482/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
