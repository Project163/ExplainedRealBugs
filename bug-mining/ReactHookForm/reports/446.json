Steps to reproduce\n\n2. Press Submit\r\n3. See that `firstName` is true in the `validatingFields` object\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nWhen `trigger` on a field is called and validation has finished i would expect that field to be set to `false` in the `validatingFields` object. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, In the documentation it says that the `validatingFields`\r\n\r\n> Capture fields which are getting async validation.\r\n\r\nI'm interpreting this as only fields with `async` validation functions could ever end up in the object but that seems not to be the case. As this is reproducible with e.g. a yup schema that uses `test` with an `async` validation function. But i may be misunderstanding its purpose.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11590/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11590/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
