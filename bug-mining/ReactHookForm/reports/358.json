Version Number\n\n7.17.5\n\n### Codesandbox/Expo snack\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/friendly-black-kngb2\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThe value of isValid is different from exporting useFormState and exporting useForm.\r\nThe result is therefore incorrect via useFormState.\r\n\r\nMy form is here in onBlur mode but I want to have specific fields with onChange so I am using the trigger on my onChange for this field.\r\n\r\nI invite you to uncomment my sandbox code in order to see the problem.\r\nThe values ​​displayed by the export of useFormState are not logical (undefined)\r\n\r\nExample in sandbox with useFormState:\r\n- value length = 5 -> isValid = undefined\r\n- value length = 6 -> isValid = true\r\n- value length = 7 -> isValid = undefined\r\n\r\nExample in sandbox with useForm:\r\n- value length = 5 -> isValidUseForm = false\r\n- value length = 6 -> isValidUseForm = true\r\n- value length = 7 -> isValidUseForm = true\r\n\r\nExample in sandbox with useForm **AND** useFormState:\r\n- value length = 5 -> isValid = isValidUseForm = false\r\n- value length = 6 -> isValid = isValidUseForm = true\r\n- value length = 7 -> isValid = isValidUseForm = true\r\n\r\nHowever, if I export both at the same time, it fixes the export of useFormState.\r\n\r\nTested only on isValid\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nSame Result when i use useFormState and export from useForm\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow
