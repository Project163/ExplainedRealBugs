Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nNote: field1 is uncontrolled, field2 is controlled.\r\n\r\nSubmit the form. \r\nIn the console, you should see the form values object and the controlled field. \r\nSee how controlled field has value in it, but gets ommited from getValues() value even though disabled flag is false.\r\nAnd since this field is required, it gets stuck in validation. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nfield 2 shouldn't be ommited since disabled flag is false and it's value should be in getValues() value.\r\nTherefore, required validation would pass, since the field (still) has value in it.\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow
