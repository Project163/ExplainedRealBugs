Go to the CodeSandbox ([link](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-rules-forked-gvzqv7))\n2. Open the CodeSandbox console\n3. Submit the form. It does not matter whether the form is valid or not. \n4. \"Validating!\" should appear in the console\n5. Press the \"Add array item\" button\n6. \"Validating\" appears in the console again. This is the bug. \n7. \"Validating\" also appears when items are removed.\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nValidation should only be triggered on submit when `mode` and `revalidateMode` are both set to \"onSubmit\", not when items are added to or removed from an array field.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
