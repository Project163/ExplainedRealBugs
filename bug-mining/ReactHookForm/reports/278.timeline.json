the input could be anything. For example, let's say we have a custom input like `react-select` and our input looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  value: string,\r\n  label: string,\r\n  meta: {\r\n    someList: []\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, I want to use react select but attach some meta information to each select input. I do this all the time currently. If we don't allow nested list items, then I can't use an array to represent the input.\r\n\r\nAnother example and where this is causing a crash in for a custom picklist component I built. The picklist allows the user to select an active and inactive list of elements. The data model looks like this.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface Element {\r\n  value: string, \r\n  label: string\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface PickListValue<> {\r\n    activeElements: Array<Element>\r\n    inactiveElements: Array<Element>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI use the `onChange` method provided by `field` in the controller `render` function in order to change this input. I currently can't use this input because it's represented using an object with a nested list.\r\n\r\nHere's what it looks like for reference.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2021-05-12 16-52-53](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36898266/118058362-ecfab980-b342-11eb-844c-2d56bdb44a91.png)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/840177798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wdfinch","id":36898266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODk4MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36898266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch","html_url":"https://github.com/wdfinch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/840179272","html_url":"https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5179#issuecomment-840179272","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5179","id":840179272,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MDE3OTI3Mg==","user":{"login":"wdfinch","id":36898266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODk4MjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36898266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch","html_url":"https://github.com/wdfinch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wdfinch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-13T00:02:40Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T00:13:38Z","body":"For simple cases this is true, but many inputs are complex and don't align with a simple text or number.
