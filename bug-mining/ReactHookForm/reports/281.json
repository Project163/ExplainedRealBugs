This only seems to occur in the v7.6 version.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nUse this sandbox for the following scenarios; https://codesandbox.io/s/youthful-haze-rx39o\r\n\r\nAll selected as default scenario:\r\n1. Using `meal1`, try to deselect any of the checkboxes\r\n2. The watcher doesn't remove the values from the array\r\n3. Submitting the form doesn't remove values from the array\r\n\r\nSome selected as default scenario:\r\n1. Using `meal2`, try to toggle the checkboxes\r\n2. In the watcher, `lunch` and `supper` are always present ignoring any other values\r\n3. Breakfast and dinner can be toggled correctly.\r\n4. Submitting the form gives the same results as the watcher\r\n\r\nNo values selected as default:\r\n`meal3` (`[]`) and `meal4` (`undefined`) work correctly and are there for counter examples.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/youthful-haze-rx39o\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAll default value combinations should work consistently allowing default selected checkboxes to be deselected.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n(I think this is unrelated to at least browser)\r\n- OS: OSX\r\n- Browser safari, chrome\r\n- Version 7.6","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5262/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
