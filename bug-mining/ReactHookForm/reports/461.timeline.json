Version Number\n\n7.53.1\n\n### Codesandbox/Expo snack\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/calc-forked-93m7f3?workspaceId=3123472d-a31f-4ddf-a4e0-79c596270dc0\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/calc-forked-93m7f3?workspaceId=3123472d-a31f-4ddf-a4e0-79c596270dc0\r\n2. The form should show a cart with 3 items, each of which has one or more variants. This uses two nested field arrays. \r\n3. Click on any of the \"Delete Item\" buttons to remove a row\r\n4. See the error message at the bottom of the form: \"The form is invalid\". \r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nWhen removing a row, react-hook-form should not validate the inputs of that row anymore. Yet it does: if you look at the console, you will see that it tries to validate 'cart.2.variants' field, which is undefined as soon as we've removed a row. The error message should not appear in this case. \r\n\r\n*Note*: The problem only seems to occur if we use a `rules: { validate }` in the nested array field. It doesn't occur if we use a `rules: { required }`.\r\n\r\n*Note*: I've checked that this is not the same bug as https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12291, as the sandbox uses react-hook-form v7.53.1, where this bug is supposed to be fixed. \r\n\r\nThis problem was originally noticed on react-admin (see https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/issues/9961)\n\n### What
