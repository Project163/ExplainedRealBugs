In Firefox, this object is non-configurable, throwing an error. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Using Firefox, create a form with an input file and register it in react-hook-form\r\n2. Add a file to it\r\n3. Unmount the component\r\n4. See error\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link**\r\nWill add later\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNo error.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10, macOS Catalina\r\n - Firefox\r\n - Version 72.0.2 (macOS)\r\n\r\n**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**\r\n- Not tested\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIn my app, the input is in a child Materials-UI modal. The input, however, is a native HTML.\r\nAfter clicking submit, `handleSubmit` execute a function that updates the parent state, closing the modal. Then, the error occurs.\r\n\r\nI couldn't use react-hook-form for this input type, however, I still used it with the other form inputs. As a workaround, I set an `onChange` in the file input that sets a state with the file list. Then, at submitting, before sending the form data collected by react-hook-form to the API, I injected the state data.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/932/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
