But now after last release it broke again.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nPass partial<T> as defaultValues on 6.10.0, notice the error. Passing a type doesn't cause it.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/hungry-shaw-709ki?file=/src/App.tsx\r\n- Use previous version and notice how there's no error.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt should work with both types and interfaces\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nMost likely the issue was caused by #3293, previously it was fixed on https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/commit/3ca4a7516e553aa1ed43e479af85103cb80b7003\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3313/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3313/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
