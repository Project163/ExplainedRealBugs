 yes - indeed the toggle optional input button works as expected, and so does the `Name field` when unmounting the entire useform. \r\n\r\nHowever, the `Controller Field` (below the name field), does not get reset when unmounting the entire form, which is exactly the bug described. It should be reset to it's default value when unmounting and re-mounting the entire form, and it does not.\r\n\r\nThe difference between `Name field` and `Controller field` is only the use of the Controller component. Both are in a nested state and `Name field` gets reset just fine - however  `controller field` is not reset when destroying the entire form. \r\n\r\nTo be entirely clear - I am not talking about the `toggle optional input` button where values actually _should_ persist. I'm talking about the global toggle button where the entire form is destroyed, and values should **not** persist.\r\n\r\nSo steps to reproduce in the codepen provided earlier:\r\n\r\n- type something in  `Controller field`, then use the *global* toggle to unmount and re-mount the entire form. \r\nExpected outcome: The `Controller field` value gets reset to its default value. \r\nActual outcome: the `Controller field` value does _not_ get reset to its default value, it actually retains the value from before destroying the form. \r\nYou can confirm this in the log of `defaultData` - it has actually been mutated to contain the value you typed.\r\n\r\n- To confirm that the bug is fixed with non-nested field paths, but pertains with nested field paths: type something in  `Name field`, then use the *global* toggle to unmount and re-mount the entire form. Expected outcome: The name field value gets reset to its default value.

fine.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/709002217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ambewas","id":12760021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzYwMDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12760021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambewas","html_url":"https://github.com/ambewas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambewas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambewas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambewas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambewas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambewas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambewas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambewas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambewas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambewas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3880352027,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg4MDM1MjAyNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/3880352027","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-15T08:51:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3880352033,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4ODAzNTIwMzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/3880352033","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-15T08:51:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/709013545","html_url":"https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2955#issuecomment-709013545","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2955","id":709013545,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwOTAxMzU0NQ==","user":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_ur
