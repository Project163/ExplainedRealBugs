With just the not nested field filled, the `trigger()` returns `true` but `trigger('last.name')` returns `false`, and the error object is like: \r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  last: {\r\n    name: {\r\n      type: \"required\",\r\n      message: \"\", \r\n      ref: <input name=\"last.name\" placeholder=\"Last name\"></input>\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[codesandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-js-forked-hpp9l?file=/src/App.js)\r\n\r\nIs `trigger()` supposed to validated all fields, even those registered like `{...register('last.name', { required: true })}`, or I got it wrong?\r\n \r\nThank you very much for your time.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @andrepxa in https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/discussions/5337_","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5382/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
