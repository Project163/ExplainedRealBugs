Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-vy8fv\r\n2. Click on the append button a few times\r\n3. Change the text value of the second item\r\n4. Delete the last item\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-vy8fv\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would expect the value I entered into the textbox to remain after deleting another item from the array. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Mac 10.14.6\r\n - Browser: Chrome\r\n - Version 79.0.3945.13\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nInterestingly enough, if you change the `li` key to `test[${index}]`, it will retain the values when you delete an item from the stack.  Unfortunately, this appears to have a similar issue.  If you click append a couple of times, change the values to a, b, and c and then delete b, it will delete c instead. \r\n\r\nThank you for this wonderful little library! 🍻 ","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/892/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/892/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
