This change was introduced in one of the PRs in `7.55.0-next.8`, specifically [PR#12675](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/pull/12675).\n\nIt seems that the changes introduced in #12675 have affected the behavior mentioned in this issue. However, I haven’t had the time to look into the exact behavior in detail yet. (I suspect there might be some logic that fills in default values when `_fields` is completely empty.)\n\n`7.55.0-next.7`\n```ts\n// src/logic/createFormControl.ts\nconst _reset: UseFormReset<TFieldValues> = (\n// ...\n        _fields = {};\n// ...\n```\n\n`7.55.0-next.8`\n```ts\n// src/logic/createFormControl.ts\nconst _reset: UseFormReset<TFieldValues> = (\n// ...\n        for (const fieldName of _names.mount) {\n          setValue(\n            fieldName as FieldPath<TFieldValues>,\n            get(values, fieldName),\n          );\n        }\n// ...\n```\n\nI agree with @Jarzka’s opinion that “there should be no functional changes between patch/minor versions.”\nHowever, at the same time, I find it a bit strange that when a field is intentionally reset with undefined, its value gets replaced with `defaultValue` — even if this was the original behavior, it still feels a bit odd.\n\nHere are the options I’m considering:\n\t1.\tModify the code so that, on submit, values are filled using defaultValue, just like in versions prior to `7.55.0-next.7`.\n\t2.\tKeep the current behavior introduced in `7.55.0-next.8`.\n(Would it help clarify the spec if we add a test case that fails when the behavior reverts to that of versions before `7.55.0-next.7`?)\n\nI’d like to hear @bluebill1049 's thoughts on this.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/2985111301/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"candymask0712","id":86667412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NjY3NDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86667412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/candymask0712","html_url":"https://github.com/candymask0712","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candymask0712/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candymask0712/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candymask0712/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candymask0712/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candymask0712/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candymask0712/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candymask0712/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candymask0712/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/candymask0712/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":18215057413,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCl-cD866PZyhzwAAAAQ9s7gF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/18215057413","actor":{"login":"Jarzka","id":5528061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjgwNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5528061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka","html_url":"https://github.com/Jarzka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-18T17:17:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18215057429,"node_id":"SE_lADOCl-cD866PZyhzwAAAAQ9s7gV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/18215057429","actor":{"login":"Jarzka","id":5528061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjgwNjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5528061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka","html_url":"https://github.com/Jarzka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jarzka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-18T17:17:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18215057454,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCl-cD866PZyhzwAAAAQ9s7gu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/18215057454","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-18T17:17:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18215057469,"

`undefined` causes the value to be replaced with `defaultValue`. In fact, I have used the library for a few years now and I have always felt odd about this 😅 But at the same time I have though it probably works like this by design.\n\nI do not resist if this

Version Number\n\n7.59.0\n\n### Codesandbox/Expo snack\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/rhf-submit-default-value-754-forked-k4cf9w?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHi\n\nAfter [resetting a value to undefined](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12873) bug was fixed, I faced another issue when trying to upgrade the library.\n\nLet's assume I have a form state which looks like this:\n\n```ts\n{\n    names: [\n      // Groups of \"first name\" and \"last name\" pairs\n      [\"seppo\", \"taalasmaa\"],\n      [\"ismo\", \"laitela\"],\n    ],\n  };\n```\n\nThen I reset it to this:\n\n```ts\nreset({\n  names: [\n    [\"seppo\", \"taalasmaa\"],\n  ],\n}, {\n  keepErrors: true,\n  keepDirty: true,\n  keepDefaultValues: true,\n  keepIsSubmitted: true,\n  keepTouched: true,\n  keepIsValid: true,\n  keepSubmitCount: true,\n});\n```\n\nWhat happens next depends on the library version used:\n\n## Old version 7.54.2\n\n- Go to https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/rhf-submit-default-value-754-forked-k4cf9w?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx\n- Click \"Remove last item\"\n- The last item is removed and the new form state is `{\"names\":[[\"seppo\",\"taalasmaa\"]]}`\n\n## New version 7.59.0\n\n- Go to https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/rhf-reset-range-broken-5m424w?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx\n- Click \"Remove last item\"\n- Nothing happens and the form state is still `{\"names\":[[\"seppo\",\"taalasmaa\"],[\"ismo\",\"laitela\"]]}`\n\n## Cause\n\nIt took me a whole day to debug this and also dig into the source code of React Hook Form. Finally, I found this loop inside `reset` function which \"overrides\" my reset values.\n\n```ts\nfor (const fieldName of _names.mount) {\n    const value = get(values, fieldName, get(_defaultValues, fieldName));\n    if (!isUndefined(value)) {\n        set(values, fieldName, value);\n        setValue(fieldName, get(values, fieldName));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRHF loops the form state field by field. It finds field `names.0` with a new reset value `[\"seppo\",\"taalasmaa\"]`. This is fine. Next, it finds field `names.1`. This field has no value in `reset` arguments (RHF thinks I'm resetting it to `undefined`), so it picks an old value from `defaultValues`, i.e. `[\"ismo\", \"laitela\"]`.\n\nHowever, what I expect to happen is that the value should be removed completely as `names.1` is part of top level `names` array which does not have it anymore.\n\n```ts\n{\n  names: [\n    [\"seppo\", \"taalasmaa\"],\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nPreviously this wasn't a problem when values were reset \"at once\":\n\n```ts\n_formValues = _options.shouldUnregister\n    ? keepStateOptions.keepDefaultValues\n        ? cloneObject(_defaultValues)\n        : {}\n    : cloneObject(values);\n```\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nNo functional changes between minor/patch versions, i.e. the expected output is `{\"names\":[[\"seppo\",\"taalasmaa\"]]}`\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12922/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19178134198,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCl-cD866PZyhzwAAAAR3Gxq2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/19178134198","actor":{"login":"EItanya","id":4185086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODUwODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4185086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EItanya","html_url":"https://github.com/EItanya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EItanya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EItanya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EItanya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EItanya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EItanya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EItanya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EItanya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EItanya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EItanya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0543a2c9dc4a129806b5c78b09b5c47d014c2acb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kagent-dev/kagent/commits/0543a2c9dc4a129806b5c78b09b5c47d014c2acb","created_at":"2025-08-15T15:52:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
