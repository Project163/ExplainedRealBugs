Having multiple of these scenarios, such as when using the `test` method on yup, they will overwrite each other in the error output.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create a form with a validation schema that has a failing test.\r\n2. Check the \"errors\" output after submitting the form and you will see an \"undefined\" property with the error that was thrown from that test.\r\n\r\n**CodeSandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/heuristic-cray-9e1nt\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nErrors that have undefined paths should not be added to the \"errors\" output. If test errors are needed in the output, the test function should return `this.createError` with a defined path. (this currently works)\r\n\r\nI will be glad to submit a PR for this if that would help.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1464/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
