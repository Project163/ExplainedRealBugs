Go to the Codesandbox below\r\n2. See validation errors marked on initial render\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link**\r\n\r\nForked from the provided `useForm` template:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-validation-on-initial-render-t83c6?file=/src/index.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behaviour**\r\n\r\nOn initial render, the fields should not be validated or marked as having errors before a user has interacted with them.\r\n\r\n**Desktop**\r\n\r\n- OS: MacOS 10.15.7\r\n- Browser: Confirmed on Chrome & Safari so far\r\n- Version: Chrome 85.0.4183.121 & Safari 14.0\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI've been busy focusing other components of the site I'm working on, however I don't recall getting this error whilst using earlier version(s) of React Hook Form and/or @hookform/resolvers.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I'm sure this issue isn't specific to Gatsby.js SSR as I get the same issue on the Codesandbox when using vanilla React.\r\n\r\nAs [I've stated before](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1223#issuecomment-599954835), thank you for your work on this fantastic library and taking the time to check out my issue 🤩","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3098/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3098/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
