However if I provide an id, rather than react-hook-form generating one, and it matches a controlled input that has already been rendered, calling reset will not reset the controlled input.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\nSee example\r\n\r\n1. Create a form with a field array\r\n2. Set some default values, which contain an  id: `{ test: [ {\"id\": \"123\", \"firstName: \"Bill\", lastName: \"Luo\"} ] }` \r\n3. Assign properties to controlled inputs within the field array\r\n4. Call `reset({  test: [{\"id\": \"123\", \"firstName\": \"Milo\", \"lastName\": \"Hill\" }]})`\r\n5. Note that the controlled inputs are not reset to the new values\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nInclude a codesandbox will help us to investigate the issue quicker.\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-template-forked-gs2xw?file=/src/index.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe controlled input should be reset, just like the uncontrolled inputs\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\nSafari 14\r\nChrome 86\r\n\r\n**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\nNot tested\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
