\r\n\r\nThanks for reporting the issue. The root cause is from util \"cloneObject\" which shallow copy object when there is a function inside object properties.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/blob/104314d38b9c3c9270fc11ca217169ef01871309/src/utils/cloneObject.ts#L17-L22\r\n\r\nIn this case, array has new prototype method \"myMethod\" therefore the whole array is kept as a shallow copy instead of deep clone and lead to share same reference between \"defaultValues\" and \"formValues\" which causes wrong form state checking (invalid , dirty).\r\n\r\n@bluebill1049 : Can we add a double check \"!Array.isArray(data)\" before shallow copy \"data\" at line 19 ? \r\n\r\nMay be adding \"hasOwnProperty\" when using \"for ... in ...\" following javascript best practice to avoid any potential issue related to \"prototype\" is considered too.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Using \"Object.defineProperty\" will bypass the issue because default setting \"enumerable\" is false therefore custom method \"myMethod\" will not show on \"for ... in ...\" loop.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/1247121361/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"leapful","id":18494222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDk0MjIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18494222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leapful","html_url":"https://github.com/leapful","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leapful/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leapful/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leapful/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leapful/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leapful/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leapful/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leapful/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leapful/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leapful/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7388306279,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCl-cD85R11qVzwAAAAG4YJtn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/7388306279","actor":{"login":"marcselman","id":514683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/514683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman","html_url":"https://github.com/marcselman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-14T18:00:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7388306287,"node_id":"SE_lADOCl-cD85R11qVzwAAAAG4YJtv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/7388306287","actor":{"login":"marcselman","id":514683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/514683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman","html_url":"https://github.com/marcselman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcselman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-14T18:00:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7388306301,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCl-cD85R11qVzwAAAAG4YJt9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/7388306301","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-14T18:00:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7

Thanks for the investigation @leapful This is something we try to avoid with `cloneObject` in general, such as complex object type as moment or luxon. unless this is a generic use case around the community, we do not consider supporting it for now. It's a good practice to keep `defaultValues` as a pure value object instead of carrying methods/prototypes.\r\n\r\nI would most definitely expect a forms library to properly support DateTime objects. I'm honestly kinda surprised that it's not supported right now. It's pretty common to have datetime fields in a form.\r\nThis pretty much breaks react-hook-form for my me.\r\n\r\nI have a form with multiple fields, one of the fields is a DateTimePicker from mui, therefore I have a luxon DateTime object in my form and the .now value as a default.
