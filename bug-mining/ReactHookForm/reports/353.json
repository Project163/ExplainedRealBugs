Go to [this Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/gracious-wilson-nrtzk?file=/src/App.js)\r\n2. Click on the reset button\r\n3. See the value of watched inputs being reset to an empty object instead of defaultValues\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nCalling the reset function with keepDefaultValues: true should reset to defaultValues.\r\nThe behaviour does not apply when shouldUnregister is false. Is this intended?\r\nThe input itself has the correct value though, resulting in a mismatch between the watched value and the actual value.\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/6792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/6792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
