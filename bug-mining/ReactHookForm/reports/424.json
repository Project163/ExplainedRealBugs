Add any method to `Array.prototype` from anywhere in code\r\n2. Create a form with `useFieldArray` with a required field\r\n3. Submit the form with the required field empty -> this will give a validation error\r\n4. Enter some data in the required field\r\n5. Submit the form again -> this will now give a validation error with an empty array as error\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nWhen submitting the form with the required field filled no validation error should occur.\r\nExtra methods on `Array.prototype` (not overrides) should not affect `react-hook-form`\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nFirefox, Chrome, Edge\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9037/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
