Added new field by clicking `Add new profile`\r\n2. Click `Submit` to see validation errors\r\n3. Check `Checkbox`\r\n4.  All validation errors are cleared, even for the untouched input fields.\r\n5. Can see the input fields' validation errors when submitting the form again \r\n\r\nPS: It only happens with the checkbox in the field array while the other fields work well.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe validation error should only be removed for the field that cleared all the validations.\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\nFirefox, Chrome, Safari\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/6469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/6469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
