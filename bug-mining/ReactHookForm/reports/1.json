But it provides Hints in IDEs.\r\n\r\n***Additional (Probably Impossible) Request:***\r\n\r\n*I'm not exactly sure how (or if it's even possible), but if it is possible to be specific enough with the type to remove string and also support arrays and nested fields, strictly with the correct type, it would be super nice.
