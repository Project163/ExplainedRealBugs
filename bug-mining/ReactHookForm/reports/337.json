One for the `destination` and one for `departureDate`.\r\n\r\n In order to render `destination` I am using `Controller`:\r\n```\r\n<Controller\r\n  render={({ field }) => <input {...field} />}\r\n  name={`routes.${index}.origin`}\r\n  control={control}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of better code organization I moved `departureDate` in separate component:\r\n```\r\nfunction Dates({ control, getValues, index }) {\r\n  console.log(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(getValues())));\r\n  return (\r\n    <Controller\r\n      render={({ field }) => <input {...field} />}\r\n      name={`routes.${index}.departureDate`}\r\n      control={control}\r\n    />\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see I am trying to output `getValues()`. On my surprise I am getting back only `origin` field and no others that were initialized by default values:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"556\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-09-10 at 00 24 31\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/311634/132770705-c0181d17-c56a-4ae2-8f28-e3c898329ce8.png\">\r\n\r\nI tried to comment out `Controller` which controls `origin`. I got back all values. My conclusion is that `Controller` somehow breaks the values.\r\n\r\nYou can reproduce this issue on attached codesandbox link.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe `getValues` method should return everything what was set as a default value.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/6509/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/6509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
