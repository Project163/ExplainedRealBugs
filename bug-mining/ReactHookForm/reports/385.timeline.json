minor issues and bits of behavior, including updating the React-Redux peer dep to `^8.0.2` final, stable sorting in `createEntityAdapter.updateMany` and some initial state handling in `createSlice`.\n\n#### Changelog\n\n##### React-Redux Peer Dep\n\nWe'd previously published an RTK build that accepted React-Redux v8 beta as a peer dep (for use with RTK Query). Since React-Redux v8 is out now, we've updated the peer dep to `^8.0.2`.\n\n##### Entity Adapter Updates\n\nPreviously, applying updates via `createEntityAdapter.updateMany` caused sorting order to change.  Entities that had the same sorting result *should* have stayed in the same order relative to each other, but if one of those items had any updates, it would sort to the back of that group.  This was due to items being removed from the lookup table and re-added, and since JS engines iterate keys in insertion order, the updated item would now end up compared later than before.\n\nWe've reworked the implementation of `updateMany` to avoid that.  This also ended up fixing another issue where multiple update entries targeting the same item ID would only have the first applied.\n\n#### `createSlice` Initial State\n\n`createSlice` now logs an error if `initialState` is `undefined`. This is most commonly seen when users misspell `initialState`.  It also has better handling for values that can't be frozen by Immer such as primitives.\n\n##### RTK Query\n\nSeveral assorted improvements, including TS types for `BaseQuery` and checking if the body can actually be safely stringified.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n-   Add Missing Else to enhanceEndpoints Function by [@&#8203;kinson](https://togithub.com/kinson) in [https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/2386](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/2386)\n-   Check initial state is draftable before using immer to freeze it. by [@&#8203;EskiMojo14](https://togithub.com/EskiMojo14) in [https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/2378](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/2378)\n-   Check that body isJsonifiable before stringify by [@&#8203;ShaunDychko](https://togithub.com/ShaunDychko) in [https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/2330](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/2330)\n-   Respect BaseQuery meta types when enhancing by [@&#8203;TamasSzigeti](https://togithub.com/TamasSzigeti) in [https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/2225](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/2225)\n-   Throw new error when initial state is undefined by [@&#8203;dannielss](https://togithub.com/dannielss) in [https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/2461](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/2461)\n-   Rewrite `updateMany` to ensure stable sorting order by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://togithub.com/markerikson) in [https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/2464](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/2464)\n-   Bump React-Redux peer dep by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://togithub.com/markerikson) in https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/commit/3033a33c3dd2ad743f02a44603bc77174599eebc\n\n#### New Contributors\n\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v1.8.2...1.8.3\n\n### [`v1.8.2`](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v1.8.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/1.8.1...v1.8.2)\n\nThis bugfix release fixes a minor issue where calling `listenerMiddleware.startListening()` multiple times with the same `effect` callback reference would result in multiple entries being added.
