I have a similar problem with current 7.18.1 version.\r\nFor me it seems that useForm getValues method is not aligned with useFieldArray fields values correctly.\r\nWhen I append 2 objects example object1 and object2 ( { id: uuid(), name: \"\" }) to field array it is saved for me in the redux store using values from getValues().\r\nThen I unmount the form from component lets say by unselecting my active item.\r\nThen by selecting active item again to mount the form with default values from redux (all ids are unique still) I remove object1 from fieldArray and then add new object3.\r\n\r\nExpected result: \r\nObject2 and object3 should have unique ids from getValues()\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\nLast added object 3 has the same id that object 2 from getValues().\r\nAlthough useFieldArray fields have unique ids for object2 and object3.\r\nSo getValues() and array fields are not in sync correctly.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a bug with
