Thanks for your answer! I would strongly prefer `defaultValues` to override `defaultValue` also for controlled inputs. Otherwise it wouldn't be possible anymore to throw an existing object (e.g. from database) in `defaultValues` and have the whole form state correct. Also I would prefer controlled and uncontrolled inputs to behave as similar as possible. \r\nIs there maybe a way to add a flag for that?\r\n\r\nEdit: Just have seen your second reply right after I posted my comment. 👍 I will be looking forward to
