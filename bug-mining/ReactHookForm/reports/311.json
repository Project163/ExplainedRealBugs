This issue is slightly different from https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5838, but probably related.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Form \"resets\" the field `name` to `\"initial\"` after 500msec delay\r\n2. Click \"setValue\" button\r\n3. Input is **not** updated\r\n4. Submit the form once: logs correct value `\"abc\"`\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/lucid-cache-7ikxh?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nStep 3: Input should be updated to show correct value `abc`.\r\nEverything works as expected in v7.9.0 (switch between versions in the Codesandbox above). It seems this broke with v7.10.0.\r\nEverything works as expected in v7.10.2-beta.0, but only if `reset` is never called.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS 10.15\r\n- Browser: Firefox, Safari, Chrome -- all the same.\r\n- Version: 89, 14, latest\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5911/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
