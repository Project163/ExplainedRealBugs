Removing the newly added row, makes the validation true. Only filling out the default row makes the form valid, however, adding two rows and remove the default one makes the form invalid.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/romantic-ptolemy-nlgcc?file=/src/App.tsx\r\n2. Fill out \"Test\" in \"Name\r\n3. Fill out \"1\" in Field 1 and \"2\" in Field 2\r\n4. Notice the form is valid\r\n5. Click \"Add Row\"\r\n6. Notice the form is invalid\r\n7. Fill out \"3\" in Field 1 and \"4\" in Field 2\r\n8. Notice how the form stays invalid\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/romantic-ptolemy-nlgcc?file=/src/App.tsx\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe validation to form on dynamically added fields.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5234/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5234/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
