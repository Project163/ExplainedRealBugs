Uncheck both `isDisabled` and `isRequired` boxes. Submit the form. In the console, you should see the form values object. `field1` and `field2` are empty strings.\r\n2. Check only `isDisabled` box. Submit the form. In the console, you should see the form values object. `field1` and `field2` are `undefined`.\r\n3. Check only `isRequired` box. Submit the form (leave the text fields empty). You should see \"field1 field2\" string under the submit button indicating both fields are invalid.\r\n4. Check both `isDisabled` and `isRequired` boxes. Submit the form (leave the text fields empty). You should see \"field2\" string under the submit button indicating only `field2` is invalid.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nSo, the `disabled` prop of the `register` method 1) disables the input, 2) leads the input value to be `undefined`, 3) omits built-in validation rules. But the `disabled` prop of the `Controller` component does only 1) and 2), but not 3). It does not skip validation.\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11267/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11267/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
