Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-tabs-problems-01-required-numbers-kmy5jp?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx\n2. Click on submit (without clicking on any other tabs)\n3. Look at console log\n4. You should see `errors {prop2: Object, prop3: Object}`\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nForm should submit without any errors since the default values have been provided for all required inputs. The exact same thing but with \"text\" inputs works as expected and submits the form with all data from `defaultValues` and no errors as can be seen in this sandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-tabs-problems-01-required-strings-9btufh?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nFirefox, Chrome, Edge\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct\n\n_Originally posted by @elieven in https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/discussions/9568_\n    ","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9571/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
