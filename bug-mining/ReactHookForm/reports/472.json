I set a timer in sandbox whcih will trigger disabled to false.\n\nI have some more advanced stuff going on in my use case where I have reactive values fetch from one API and disabled state from another one but it defaults to false. When consol logging in my case neither values or disabled state change but still it gives me isDirty for every fields inside.\n\n Since 7.54.2 all the fields report that they are dirty if I use the disabled switch in the useForm directly. \n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe fields isDirty state is kept false if the value was not changed.\nIt was all fine in 7.54.1. I saw there was some work with disabled state, watching values etc. I am not sure if this is a bug or expected behaviour which was just fixed in last release but seems to be it is a bug because fields are not Dirty.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\n\n```\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [x] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12531/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12531/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
