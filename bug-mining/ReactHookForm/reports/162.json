This seems to be happening when providing a defaultValues object to useForm.\r\n\r\nIt also seems to only be happening when having a field array nested inside an object, but I'm a 100% sure as I need to test it a bit more!\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-field-array-dirty-s9xg5?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the CodeSandbox provided above\r\n2. click on add\r\n3. press Tab to switch to the second field\r\n4. first field is marked dirty\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFields should not be marked as dirty.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: macOs\r\n- Browser chrome\r\n- Version 85\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe issue is resolved by removing the defaultValues from the useForm parameters!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2778/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
