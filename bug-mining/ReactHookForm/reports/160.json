Executing the function without arguments results in a re-render for every field in the form. `handleSubmit` on the other hand causes only 2 re-renders, no matter how many fields there are in the form. This is especially problematic for partial / manual validation of forms containing many fields.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nUse the provided sandbox. It contains 8 inputs, `render` counter, a `submit` button and a `trigger` button. The `trigger` button executes partial validation for the first 5 fields. Click the `trigger` button and monitor the `render` counter. \r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link**\r\n- [trigger issue sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-partial-validation-issue-w43r0)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe `trigger` function should behave similar to `handleSubmit` function. A single call to `trigger` should cause 1 re-render regardless of the number of fields passed to it. I guess the 2 re-renders for `handleSubmit` are caused by `formState` first changing to `submitting`, so for `trigger` there should be only 1 re-render.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: Windows\r\n- Browser Chrome (85.0.4183.83), Opera (70.0.3728.133)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2758/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
