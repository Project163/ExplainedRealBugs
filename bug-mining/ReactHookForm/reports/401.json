Open codesandbox and observe initial values for Touched and Dirty are empty and isDirty is false in the console. Note different default values have been set for each fields: null and empty string. `useEffect` has been set up with `isDirty` as a dependency.\r\n2. Gain focus on `null default` field via tab or click.\r\n3. Lose focus on the field.\r\n4. Observe `isDirty` has been flipped to true however Dirty still reports an empty array.\r\n5. Refresh the page in codesandbox and verify inital state looks like described in step 1.\r\n6. Gain focus on `empty string default` field via tab or click.\r\n7. Lose focus on the field.\r\n8. Observe no additional logging because `isDirty` remains false has not triggered `useEffect`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n`isDirty` should not change its value if the user has touched the field, but not input any values regardless of the default value.\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
