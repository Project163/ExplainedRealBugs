Go to the sandbox below\r\n2. Notice that `isValid` is `true`\r\n3. Click on `RESET` button (now `isValid` is `false`)\r\n4. Change just one input value\r\n5. Notice that `isValid` is still `false`\r\n6. Click on `VALIDATE` or change the other input value (now `isValid` is `true`)\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-reset-forces-all-fields-to-be-changed-p9q8v\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAfter calling `reset()` with default values we can do two different things:\r\n1. If default values fulfill form validations `isValid` should be `true`.\r\n2. If default values fulfill form validations as soon as one input changes to a still valid value `isValid` should be `true`.\r\nIf you agree that this is a bug decide which one of the above solutions is better and makes more sense.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: macOS Catalina Version 10.15.1\r\n - Browser: Google Chrome Version 78.0.3904.108 (Official Build) (64-bit)","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/547/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
