Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/gracious-shirley-uydsgr?file=/src/App.tsx\r\n2. See that only the `boolean` checkbox is checked, whereas the `string[]` checkboxes are not.\r\n3. (Optional): Remove the `disabled` attributes from all 3 checkboxes and reload the application to verify that the Codesandbox actually works.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI'd expect the `string[]` checkboxes to be checked as well. Although the documentation states that disabled inputs will result in an `undefined` form value (when submitted, I presume), I'd still expect them to get initialised correctly for visualisation (and the behaviour to be consistent between boolean and array variants).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9109884/191751471-05085c40-5f65-4bcd-9e21-b06d21ba103f.png)\r\n\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9082/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
