into this a little bit, it looks like the issue stems from `appendId` (see [mapIds.ts#L12](/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/blob/master/src/logic/mapIds.ts#L12)). That function spreads `value`, which doesn't work as intended with string values. This would seem to only work when `fields` is an array of objects, and give inconsistent results for other values (e.g. array of strings, array of arrays).\r\n\r\nFor consistency's sake, would it make more sense to keep the shape of `fields` the same regardless of the type of `value`? Removing the spread might be enough, assuming it doesn't cause any regressions.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```js\r\n// Before\r\n\r\nexport const appendId = <\r\n  FormArrayValues extends {\r\n    id?:

team, first of all thanks for the hook, you've made porting my application over to hooks a pleasure.\r\n\r\nI'm having an issue with useFieldArray whereby simply appending an item to the array seems to serialise the array and add each as a seperate value in the parent form.\r\n\r\nI've forked your example sandbox and added a `JSON.stringify` to print the form state to illustrate the issue. To reproduce, simple use the `append` button and pay attention to the new state of the form being printed.\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-2hdro\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAppending/prepending objects to the array should do exactly that, not add these as individual values of the parent state.\r\n\r\n - OS: macOS High Sierra 10.13.6\r\n - Chrome 79.0.3945.130\r\n\r\nI had a brief look at the source, and the append function looks fine to me. 🤷‍♂ Although, I've not dug too much and my typescript experience is minimal.\r\n\r\nThanks in

I'm happy to open a PR for either solution, just let me know.\r\n\r\nhey @ryanwalters I guess it's tradeoff with FieldArray uncontrolled, because it will need to be an object which contains a unique ID for the `map`, however if you have better suggestion or idea why not! :) ","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/580524909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2995403024,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk5NTQwMzAyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/2995403024","actor":{"login":"ryanwalters","id":881783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTc4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/881783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanwalters","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanwalters","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanwalters/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanwalters/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanwalters/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanwalters/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanwalters/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanwalters/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanwalters/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanwalters/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanwalters/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-31T00:24:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
