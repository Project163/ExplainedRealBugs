I did some digging, and it appears this is a consequence of a few different mechanisms at work.\r\n\r\n**First off, in the change handler:**\r\nThe value `isFieldValueUpdated` is false. This is because `_updateIsFieldValueUpdated` compares the current value with the value that is stored in the form state. It does this using `===`, meaning that the check will fail when the two values are not exactly equal.\r\nLogging the values reveals that the two objects are \"identical\", but not exactly equal. \r\n\r\n**In `useController`**\r\nThe `register` function is called every render of the component and, because \"disabled\" is a boolean, `_updateDisabledField` is called. This sets the value passed to the register function on the form state. `useController` uses `useWatch` to get access to the current value.\r\n\r\n**In `useWatch`**\r\nThe function `cloneObject` is used to clone the value before it is returned.\r\n\r\n**All together**\r\n1. Change handler is called, updating form state as well as triggering validation\r\n2. Component re-renders with updated value while asynchronous validation happens\r\n3. `register` is called with the cloned value from `useWatch`, this value is stored in the form state\r\n4. Validation completes and `_updateIsFieldValueUpdated` is called\r\n5. `_updateIsFieldValueUpdated` compares the new value and the value stored in state. **These values are not `===` equal because the value in the state was cloned by `useWatch`**\r\n6. `trigger` and `shouldRenderByError` are not called because `isFieldValueUpdated` is false and the component won't update.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/2245296945/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"quintstoffers","id":147345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzM0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quintstoffers","html_url":"https://github.com/quintstoffers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quintstoffers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quintstoffers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quintstoffers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quintstoffers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quintstoffers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quintstoffers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quintstoffers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quintstoffers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quintstoffers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13909462510,"node_id":"LE_lADOCl-cD86Qjh-XzwAAAAM9EY3u","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/13909462510","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-16T10:59:28Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13909549839,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCl-cD86Qjh-XzwAAAAM9EuMP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/13909549839","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3aa204299f1ed245e11cf880613f807706ccdcc1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/commits/3aa204299f1ed245e11cf880613f807706ccdcc1","created_at":"2024-08-16T11:08:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13909568396,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCl-cD86Qjh-XzwAAAAM9EyuM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/13909568396","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/

We did some perf investigation on user-provided examples, and concluded that the biggest factor to slow RTKQ TS perf was the calculation of hook names like <code>useGetPokemonQuery</code>, which was generating a large TS union of types.</p>\n<p>We've rewritten that hook names type calculation to use mapped types and a couple of intersections.  In a specific user-provided stress test repo, it dropped TS calculation time by 60% (2600ms to 1000ms).</p>\n<p>There's more potential work we can do to improve things, but this seems like a major perf improvement worth shipping now.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>chore: Switch 4.9.2-rc to 4.9.5 since 4.9.5 has been released in TypeScript by <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/kahirokunn/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/kahirokunn\">@ kahirokunn</a> in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1923282990\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3772\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3772/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3772\">#3772</a></li>\n<li>Copy of \"Work around known TS bug with type inference <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1920909269\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3761\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3761/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3761\">#3761</a>\" by <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/julian-ford/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/julian-ford\">@ julian-ford</a> in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1926995735\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3777\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3777/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3777\">#3777</a></li>\n<li>Rework named hooks type (v1.9) by <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/EskiMojo14/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/EskiMojo14\">@ EskiMojo14</a> in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1922287470\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3769\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3769/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3769\">#3769</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v1.9.6...v1.9.7\"><tt>v1.9.6...v1.9.7</tt></a></p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>1.9.6</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v1.9.6\">2023-09-24</a></br><p>This bugfix release adds a new dev-mode middleware to catch accidentally dispatching an action creator, adds a new listener middleware option around waiting for forks, adds a new option to update provided tags when <code>updateQueryData</code> is used, reworks internal types to better handle uses with TS declaration output, and fixes a variety of small issues.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<h3>Action Creator Dev Check Middleware</h3>\n<p>RTK already includes dev-mode middleware that check for the common mistakes of accidentally mutating state and putting non-serializable values into state or actions.</p>\n<p>Over the years we've also seen a semi-frequent error where users accidentally pass an action creator reference to <code>dispatch</code>, instead of <em>calling</em> it and dispatching the action it returns.</p>\n<p>We've added another dev-mode middleware that specifically catches this error and warns about it.</p>\n<h3>Additional Options</h3>\n<p>The listener middleware's <code>listenerApi.fork()</code> method now has an optional <code>autoJoin</code> flag that can be used to keep the effect from finishing until all active forked tasks have completed.</p>\n<p><code>updateQueryData</code> now has an <code>updateProvidedTags</code> option that will force a recalculation of that endpoint's provided tags.  It currently defaults to <code>false</code>, and we'll likely turn that to <code>true</code> in the next major.</p>\n<h3>Other Fixes</h3>\n<p>The <code>builder.addCase</code> method now throws an error if a <code>type</code> string is empty.</p>\n<p><code>fetchBaseQuery</code> now uses an alternate method to clone the original <code>Request</code> in order to work around an obscure Chrome bug.</p>\n<p>The immutability middleware logic was tweaked to avoid a potential stack overflow.</p>\n<h3>Types Changes</h3>\n<p>The internal type imports have been reworked to try to fix \"type portability\" issues when used in combination with TS declaration outputs.</p>\n<p>A couple additional types were exported to help with wrapping <code>createAsyncThunk</code>.</p>\n<h2>What's

<code>transformResponse</code> as part of <code>enhanceEndpoints</code> can now override the TS type of the original data.</p>\n<p><code>fetchBaseQuery</code> now properly checks for a global <code>responseHandler</code> option.</p>\n<h3>Performance and Internals</h3>\n<p>RTK Query now uses Immer's <code>original()</code> to do comparisons inside of <code>copyWithStructuralSharing</code>, which should significantly speed up performance when applying changes from re-fetched data.</p>\n<p>RTKQ's internal <code>subscriptionUpdated</code> action is now marked as batchable.</p>\n<p>We've updated dependencies to Immer 9.0.21, Reselect 4.1.8, and Redux 4.2.1.</p>\n<h3>CI Updates</h3>\n<p>We've added a suite of example apps built with different frameworks such as CRA 4, CRA 5, Next, and Vite, as well as examples that check for compatibility in Node with CJS and ESM modes and with various TS module resolution modes.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Test published artifacts in

We did some perf investigation on user-provided examples, and concluded that the biggest factor to slow RTKQ TS perf was the calculation of hook names like <code>useGetPokemonQuery</code>, which was generating a large TS union of types.</p>\n<p>We've rewritten that hook names type calculation to use mapped types and a couple of intersections.  In a specific user-provided stress test repo, it dropped TS calculation time by 60% (2600ms to 1000ms).</p>\n<p>There's more potential work we can do to improve things, but this seems like a major perf improvement worth shipping now.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>chore: Switch 4.9.2-rc to 4.9.5 since 4.9.5 has been released in TypeScript by <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/kahirokunn/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/kahirokunn\">@ kahirokunn</a> in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1923282990\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3772\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3772/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3772\">#3772</a></li>\n<li>Copy of \"Work around known TS bug with type inference <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1920909269\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3761\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3761/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3761\">#3761</a>\" by <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/julian-ford/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/julian-ford\">@ julian-ford</a> in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1926995735\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3777\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3777/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3777\">#3777</a></li>\n<li>Rework named hooks type (v1.9) by <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/EskiMojo14/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/EskiMojo14\">@ EskiMojo14</a> in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1922287470\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3769\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3769/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3769\">#3769</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v1.9.6...v1.9.7\"><tt>v1.9.6...v1.9.7</tt></a></p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>1.9.6</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v1.9.6\">2023-09-24</a></br><p>This bugfix release adds a new dev-mode middleware to catch accidentally dispatching an action creator, adds a new listener middleware option around waiting for forks, adds a new option to update provided tags when <code>updateQueryData</code> is used, reworks internal types to better handle uses with TS declaration output, and fixes a variety of small issues.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<h3>Action Creator Dev Check Middleware</h3>\n<p>RTK already includes dev-mode middleware that check for the common mistakes of accidentally mutating state and putting non-serializable values into state or actions.</p>\n<p>Over the years we've also seen a semi-frequent error where users accidentally pass an action creator reference to <code>dispatch</code>, instead of <em>calling</em> it and dispatching the action it returns.</p>\n<p>We've added another dev-mode middleware that specifically catches this error and warns about it.</p>\n<h3>Additional Options</h3>\n<p>The listener middleware's <code>listenerApi.fork()</code> method now has an optional <code>autoJoin</code> flag that can be used to keep the effect from finishing until all active forked tasks have completed.</p>\n<p><code>updateQueryData</code> now has an <code>updateProvidedTags</code> option that will force a recalculation of that endpoint's provided tags.  It currently defaults to <code>false</code>, and we'll likely turn that to <code>true</code> in the next major.</p>\n<h3>Other Fixes</h3>\n<p>The <code>builder.addCase</code> method now throws an error if a <code>type</code> string is empty.</p>\n<p><code>fetchBaseQuery</code> now uses an alternate method to clone the original <code>Request</code> in order to work around an obscure Chrome bug.</p>\n<p>The immutability middleware logic was tweaked to avoid a potential stack overflow.</p>\n<h3>Types Changes</h3>\n<p>The internal type imports have been reworked to try to fix \"type portability\" issues when used in combination with TS declaration outputs.</p>\n<p>A couple additional types were exported to help with wrapping <code>createAsyncThunk</code>.</p>\n<h2>What's

Thank you!</p>\n<h3>Other Changes</h3>\n<p>Arya also did significant work to improve RTK's treeshaking, tweaking internal definitions to let bundlers better separate out unused code.</p>\n<p>We've exported additional types like <code>UpdateDefinitions</code> and <code>RetryOptions</code>, per request.</p>\n<p><code>listenerMiddleware.withTypes()</code> methods now allow passing in an

We did some perf investigation on user-provided examples, and concluded that the biggest factor to slow RTKQ TS perf was the calculation of hook names like <code>useGetPokemonQuery</code>, which was generating a large TS union of types.</p>\n<p>We've rewritten that hook names type calculation to use mapped types and a couple of intersections.  In a specific user-provided stress test repo, it dropped TS calculation time by 60% (2600ms to 1000ms).</p>\n<p>There's more potential work we can do to improve things, but this seems like a major perf improvement worth shipping now.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>chore: Switch 4.9.2-rc to 4.9.5 since 4.9.5 has been released in TypeScript by <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/kahirokunn/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/kahirokunn\">@ kahirokunn</a> in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1923282990\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3772\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3772/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3772\">#3772</a></li>\n<li>Copy of \"Work around known TS bug with type inference <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1920909269\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3761\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3761/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3761\">#3761</a>\" by <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/julian-ford/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/julian-ford\">@ julian-ford</a> in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1926995735\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3777\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3777/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3777\">#3777</a></li>\n<li>Rework named hooks type (v1.9) by <a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/EskiMojo14/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/EskiMojo14\">@ EskiMojo14</a> in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1922287470\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3769\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3769/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/3769\">#3769</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Full Changelog</strong>: <a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v1.9.6...v1.9.7\"><tt>v1.9.6...v1.9.7</tt></a></p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>1.9.6</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v1.9.6\">2023-09-24</a></br><p>This bugfix release adds a new dev-mode middleware to catch accidentally dispatching an action creator, adds a new listener middleware option around waiting for forks, adds a new option to update provided tags when <code>updateQueryData</code> is used, reworks internal types to better handle uses with TS declaration output, and fixes a variety of small issues.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<h3>Action Creator Dev Check Middleware</h3>\n<p>RTK already includes dev-mode middleware that check for the common mistakes of accidentally mutating state and putting non-serializable values into state or actions.</p>\n<p>Over the years we've also seen a semi-frequent error where users accidentally pass an action creator reference to <code>dispatch</code>, instead of <em>calling</em> it and dispatching the action it returns.</p>\n<p>We've added another dev-mode middleware that specifically catches this error and warns about it.</p>\n<h3>Additional Options</h3>\n<p>The listener middleware's <code>listenerApi.fork()</code> method now has an optional <code>autoJoin</code> flag that can be used to keep the effect from finishing until all active forked tasks have completed.</p>\n<p><code>updateQueryData</code> now has an <code>updateProvidedTags</code> option that will force a recalculation of that endpoint's provided tags.  It currently defaults to <code>false</code>, and we'll likely turn that to <code>true</code> in the next major.</p>\n<h3>Other Fixes</h3>\n<p>The <code>builder.addCase</code> method now throws an error if a <code>type</code> string is empty.</p>\n<p><code>fetchBaseQuery</code> now uses an alternate method to clone the original <code>Request</code> in order to work around an obscure Chrome bug.</p>\n<p>The immutability middleware logic was tweaked to avoid a potential stack overflow.</p>\n<h3>Types Changes</h3>\n<p>The internal type imports have been reworked to try to fix \"type portability\" issues when used in combination with TS declaration outputs.</p>\n<p>A couple additional types were exported to help with wrapping <code>createAsyncThunk</code>.</p>\n<h2>What's
