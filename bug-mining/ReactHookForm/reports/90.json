Open the codesandbox below\r\n2. Click `Show form` button\r\n3. Click `Hide form` button\r\n4. Click `Reset` button\r\n5. Click `Show form` button again\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-sd6d6?file=/src/index.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAfter the step 5, I expected the form had two fields `John Doe` and `Bill Luo`, but it has only one field `John Luo`.\r\nWhen the form is submitted, only `Jon Doe` is sent.\r\n\r\nAfter resetting again or if reset before step 2, it works fine.\r\n\r\nIt worked as expected in react-hook-form < 5.3.0.\r\n\r\nIt will work if I put `useFieldArray` outside of `MyForm` component\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-d31rv?file=/src/index.js\r\nbut actually I want to separate components using `FormContext`, without  passing methods in props.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: macOS 10.15.3\r\n - Browser Chrome\r\n - Version 81.0.4044.92\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1375/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1375/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
