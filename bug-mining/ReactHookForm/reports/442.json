Open the console in code sandbox\r\n2. Confirm that it logs \r\n```\r\nprimaryColor red\r\nunRenderField watch unRenderField\r\nunRenderField useWatch unRenderField\r\n```\r\n3. Click button\r\n4. The log will show\r\n```\r\nprimaryColor red\r\nunRenderField watch undefined\r\nunRenderField useWatch unRenderField\r\n```\r\n5. Continue step 3 and you will see `unRenderField watch` always returns `undefined`\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe value of `watch` and `useWatch` should be returned consistently. So the result after click should be\r\n\r\n```\r\nprimaryColor red\r\nunRenderField watch unRenderField\r\nunRenderField useWatch unRenderField\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11322/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11322/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
