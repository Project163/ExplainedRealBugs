Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/rhf-incorrect-isvalid-wluyk?file=/src/App.tsx\r\n2. Open console and see that: isValid is initially true, but later set to false after resolver has been run.\r\n3. Click \"Toggle form\" and see that the Confirm button is disabled (and the isValid flag continues to be false)\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/rhf-incorrect-isvalid-wluyk?file=/src/App.tsx\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expect the isValid flag to be true when clicking \"Toggle form\" to display the form.\r\nExpected behavior can be reproduced by opening the above codesandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/rhf-incorrect-isvalid-wluyk?file=/src/App.tsx) and changing the react-hook-form version to 6.11.3\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: MacOS 10.15.7\r\n- Browser Chrome  88.0.4324.146 \r\n- Version  6.11.4 and later\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4219/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4219/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
