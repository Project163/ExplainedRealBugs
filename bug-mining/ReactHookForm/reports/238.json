It is easier to understand with an example:\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. open [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form--validation-bug-v7-mzfn8?file=/src/index.js)\r\n2. remove the value from the first input with the label 'Name'.\r\n3. `formState.isValid` will update to `false`\r\n4. type something in the input again\r\n5. `formState.isValid` doesn't update to `true`\r\n\r\nThis only happens when I use `onChange` and `value`, if I just spread the `field` object into the `inputProps` prop (as in my case i use Material UI) the validation works and the formState updates itself after input changes.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @knoefel in https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/discussions/4574_","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
