Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-update-rs9bj\r\n2. Click on 'Set Random Age'. FirstName(bill) will not change, only Age will change.\r\n3. Click on 'Append' and 'Set Random Age'. The FirstName will change to ''(empty) and the Age will also change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nhttps://react-hook-form.com/api/usefieldarray\r\n\r\n> When you append, prepend, insert and update the field array, the obj can't be empty object rather need to supply all your input's defaultValues.\r\n\r\n`node_modules/react-hook-form/dist/types/fieldArray.d.ts`\r\n> `const update: (index: number, value: Partial<FormItem>) => void`\r\n\r\nI'm confused by the documentation and type definitions. Since it was Partial, I assumed that if I passed some parameters, the other parts would be kept as they were. In this case, I think that `firstName: matamatanot` will be retained and only age will change.\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/7820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/7820/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
