After using the suggested solution, I was able to fix both issues by calling the `register()` method and setting `shouldUnregister` to `true`. This worked for a day until the version 7.8.0 was released and now the `undefined` bug is back.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Open [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/relaxed-galois-85r89?file=/src/App.tsx)\r\n2. Click on the submit button\r\n3. Notice the `array` state is undefined\r\n4. Notice I call both `register()` and `shouldUnregister` as [recommended](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5232#issuecomment-854662861) for `7.7.1`\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\n[CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/relaxed-galois-85r89?file=/src/App.tsx)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe behaviour remains unchanged since this was a minor version update to version 7.8.0.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI would think the problem is with `register()` now expecting a `value` supplied in options and since I don't do that, it assumes it to be `undefined`?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5507/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
