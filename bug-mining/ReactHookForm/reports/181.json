Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-nested-arrays-forked-74eb5?file=/src/index.js\r\n2. Click on APPEND NESTED\r\n3. See the log and notice there's a field 'test[0].nestedArray' added to the data passed to the resolver\r\n4. Click DELETE (the innermost one, for the nested array)\r\n5. Click DELETE again (the innermost one, for the nested array)\r\n6.
