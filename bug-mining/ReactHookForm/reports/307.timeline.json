reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/keen-shamir-2zqxn\r\n2. Open the file Form.tsx or FormWithZod.tsx\r\n3. Go to [line 76 in Form.tsx](https://codesandbox.io/s/keen-shamir-2zqxn?file=/src/Form.tsx:2097-2131) or [line 50 in FormWithZod.tsx](https://codesandbox.io/s/keen-shamir-2zqxn?file=/src/FormWithZod.tsx:1479-1513)\r\n4. See the Typescript error\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/keen-shamir-2zqxn\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nInfer the type of the error as `FieldError` because property `message` actually exists and it isn't a date object\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4307697/124420944-bb3c1880-dd1d-11eb-8e68-b2c219638bc3.png)\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: GNU/Linux (Manjaro)\r\n- Browser Firefox\r\n- Version 89\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nMaybe this is related to #5808\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5839/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5839/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7562037178,"node_id":"LOE_lADOCl-cD843wv5ZzwAAAAHCu4e6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/7562037178","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-11T12:00:43Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12878550775,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCl-cD843wv5ZzwAAAAL_nxb3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/12878550775","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5cc71b7012250e0c03df28e09f0f6c63a955b733","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/commits/5cc71b7012250e0c03df28e09f0f6c63a955b733","created_at":"2024-05-21T11:12:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
