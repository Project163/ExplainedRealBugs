you were expecting:**\r\nRemoving an item form an ArrayInput should not cause validation errors on non-existent fields\r\n\r\n**What happened instead:**\r\nAfter I removed the item and validated the form, there was a validation error for a no longer existing index\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\nHave an ArrayInput with items which also have ArrayInputs. The arrays as well as their items are validated as required.\r\nCodesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/nested-arrayinput-remove-item-issue-hz4yq8\r\n\r\n1. Open edit view\r\n2. Remove the second top level array item from the 4 (\"name2\")\r\n3. Click submit\r\n\r\nThe form is invalid, there is a validation error for the 4th item's nested array.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/assets/4885562/839554e9-5159-4a56-b4c6-91453e9c40d9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Related code:**\r\n```\r\n      <ArrayInput source=\"names\"

</ArrayInput>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\nThe issue is reproducible with version 5 as well: https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/nested-arrayinput-remove-item-issue-forked-8shcyl\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n* React-admin version: 4.16.10\r\n* Last version that did not exhibit the issue (if applicable):\r\n* React version: 18.2.0\r\n* Browser: Chrome\r\n* Stack trace (in case of a JS
