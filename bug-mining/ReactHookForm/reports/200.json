I noticed that this issue happens when inserting an item at an in-between index.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to CodeSandbox link\r\n2. Click Insert at index 1\r\n3. Watch the Console logs and see the index-1 item is `undefined`\r\n4. Click Append\r\n5. Watch the Console logs and see the last item is not `undefined`\r\n\r\n**Desired output**\r\n\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/embed/unruffled-thompson-yx492?file=/src/App.js:1628-2152\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nthe index-1 item is not `undefined`\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: MacOS 10.15.7\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Version: 86\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIf I add `shouldUnregister: false` option to `useForm`, the problem goes away\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3353/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
