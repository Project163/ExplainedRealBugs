the bug**\r\nI think it might be related to #2655, but slightly different. I am creating a form where I have defaultValues that pre-populate the form, but a field needs to be disabled so the user cannot change it. In the previous version I used (6.3.3), on submission, I used to get the value back, but in the latest version (6.7.0) it is showing up as undefined.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Create a form with default values\r\n2. disable the input field\r\n3. Click submission\r\n4. The field value is undefined\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nI'm using the same form you linked as an example in one of the help threads.\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/mystifying-grass-zelzc?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\nIf I change the input field to have the disabled prop and click submit, this is what I see\r\n![Screen Shot

the same value as the defaultValues.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: Mac\r\n- Browser Chrome\r\n- Version 6.7.0

@bluebill1049 Is this issue been fixed? You mentioned [here](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1080) that the latest release should include that if I understand correctly, but I'm still getting disabled values in submit. So not sure if I'm doing something wrong or it's not fixed.. 🙈\r\n\r\ncan you share a codesandbox and which version are you using?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/908762038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5229073830,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTIyOTA3MzgzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/5229073830","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-30T23:00:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5229073836,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUyMjkwNzM4MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/5229073836","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-30T23:00:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
