Create some state with the `useState()` hook.\r\n2. Change the state within the `onSubmit()` callback passed to the form.\r\n3. In a `useEffect()` hook, react to this state change and call `form.setError()`.\r\n\r\nThe `form.formState.isSubmitting` value never changes back to `false`, even after the `onSubmit()` callback completes.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/upbeat-smoke-37dix?file=/src/App.tsx:214-221\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`form.formState.isSubmitting` should turn to `false` after the `onSubmit` callback is executed.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: macOS 10.15.6\r\n- Browser: Chrome 86.0.4240.193\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIf `form.setError()` is called within the `onSubmit()` callback, `form.formState.isSubmitting` does return to `false` once the callback completes, as expected.","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
