continued coming from #603 \r\n\r\nRegression tests would help to keep issues closed by creating tests that resemble the exact bug description.\r\n \r\nAfter a short glance it seems you are using

[react-testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library). Do you use something like that, or are you planning to? I could prepare a scaffold depending on how you decide.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Ah I see you use jest already!
