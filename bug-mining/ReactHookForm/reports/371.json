Verify loaded version of react-hook-form in codesandbox dependencies is set on the latest version\r\n2. Click on \"Submit\" for all of the provided forms\r\n3. See validation errors and current form values\r\n\r\nI have also provided a table of the current version our software is on (7.12.2), the version that we believe broke our current implementation (7.13.0), and the latest at the time of this issue (7.22.3).\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nReact Hook Form behavior matches the native form behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Value is displayed to user\r\n2. Input cannot be modified\r\n3. Input has :disabled styling\r\n4. On submit, field is not validated\r\n5. On submit, field value is undefined\r\n\r\nHere is a link to a vanilla JS sandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/focused-germain-gcr5m?file=/index.html\r\n\r\nOn version 7.23.2 of react-hook-form, the only combination of HTML attributes/RHF rules that works as expected is React's `defaultValue` attribute and RHF's disabled rule. Using the RHF default values and RHF disabled rule does not match native browser behavior.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nFirefox, Chrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/7347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/7347/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
