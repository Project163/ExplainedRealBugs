Is there a way around this?\r\n\r\n<input type=\"text\" {...register('xxx')} />\r\n<button onClick={() => setValue(\"xxx\", \"test\")}>press me</button>\r\n\r\nAlso, similarly, I have a file input that I am not currently register on and just using setValue after uploading the image and resizing it... this also does not cause the isDirty to update. I tried to use register() and place the onChange inside it, but it caused the value of the input to become { 0: {} } and I'm not sure I understand why.\r\n\r\n <input\r\n        type=\"file\"\r\n        onChange={(e) => { handleImageUpload(e, (imageUrl) =>  setValue(\"image_url\", imageUrl))}}\r\n    />\r\n\r\nAny tips appreciated.
