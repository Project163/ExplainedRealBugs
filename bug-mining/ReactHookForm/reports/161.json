Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-query-builder-clearerrors-on-nested-items-z7d3o?file=/src/QueryBuilder.tsx\r\n2. Click on console\r\n3. Click on \"Remove Condition\"\r\n4. Note: Error on root item\r\n5. Click on \"Add Logical Group\"\r\n6. Note: There should be an error on the most nested item, but it's cleared because root item `clearErrors` fires last (see console)\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\n\r\n https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-query-builder-clearerrors-on-nested-items-z7d3o?file=/src/QueryBuilder.tsx\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nOnly the ErrorOptions at the specified path are cleared -- `{ type, types, message }` and if its an empty object, then it can be removed...\r\n\r\nSuggest the above logic or adding opts as second param to `clearErrors(arg1, { exact: true })` for backward compatibility\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n![2020-08-26 13 00 36](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1776100/91350907-3ba7f980-e79c-11ea-87d3-27c3e3f840fa.gif)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2730/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2730/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
