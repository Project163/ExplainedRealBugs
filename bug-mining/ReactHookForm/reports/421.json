Go to CodeSandbox.\r\n\r\n2. Click \"Submit\" to start displaying validation errors on change.\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-03-31 22-25-26](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8977964/229265526-7dec5de0-f42e-40a8-8e72-90c76ae03faf.png)\r\n\r\n3. Click \"Add\" button to add an element to the array, causing the array length to be too long, and the error \"Form error: Array must contain at most 3 element(s)\" to correctly appear.\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-03-31 22-25-39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8977964/229265540-5bee5e5e-7815-48bd-9531-b1098fdcd04c.png)\r\n\r\n4. Click \"Remove\" next to the newly-added element to remove it, causing the array length to be valid, thus causing the error to correctly disappear.\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-03-31 22-25-44](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8977964/229265567-abde61fb-09fe-417b-abd1-26ff47670ad3.png)\r\n\r\n5. Delete all of the text in one of the existing array elements, making it invalid and causing an error to correctly appear.\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-03-31 22-25-56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8977964/229265590-e28cf702-451a-4ab3-9ea6-baaa883b84b0.png)\r\n\r\n6. Click the \"Add\" button again to add another element to the array.  \r\n**INCORRECT BEHAVIOR:** even though the array length is no longer valid, the error from before, \"Form error: Array must contain at most 3 element(s)\", is **NOT** being displayed.\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-03-31 22-26-14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8977964/229265600-6ae9fcd9-2bdb-4324-867b-6e9426642ca2.png)\r\n\r\n7. Click the \"Submit\" button, which causes the expected error \"Form error: Array must contain at most 3 element(s)\"  to correctly display.\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-03-31 22-26-28](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8977964/229265646-2b57f838-233e-4890-b9a1-1bb77a6c1223.png)\r\n\r\n8. Click \"Remove\" next to the newly-added element, causing the array length to be valid.  \r\n**INCORRECT BEHAVIOR:** even though the array length is now valid, the error \"Form error: Array must contain at most 3 element(s)\" is still incorrectly being displayed.\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-03-31 22-26-40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8977964/229265676-56051c71-165e-4939-8c6c-f665927bf57e.png)\r\n\r\n9. Click the \"Submit\" button, which causes the incorrect error \"Form error: Array must contain at most 3 element(s)\" to disappear.\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-03-31 22-26-46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8977964/229265708-8e679250-9eaf-44cc-9c0c-117d833d6ebd.png)\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nOn step 6, clicking the \"Add\" button should immediately display the error \"Form error: Array must contain at most 3 element(s)\" instead of requiring the form to be submitted to display it.\r\n\r\nOn step 8, clicking the \"Remove\" button should immediately hide the error \"Form error: Array must contain at most 3 element(s)\" instead of requiring the form to be submitted to hide it.\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\nFirefox, Chrome\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/10139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/10139/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
