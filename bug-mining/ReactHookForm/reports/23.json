The `register` options say all items are required. After completing the form, all fields have a value and `formState.touched` includes all items are touched, but `isValid` is `false`. If you look at the `errors` of the form, you can see an error for `dateOfBirth`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce...**\r\n1. Create a form with some inputs having the name of a nested object.\r\n2. Set the submit button's `disabled` state to `!isValid`.\r\n3. Observe the behavior.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox**\r\nI have created a Codesandbox to reproduce the bug. The `console.log`'s will help you see the issue more clearly. \r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-isvalid-bug-r8dc5\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\n`dateOfBirth` should not be listed in the `errors` of the form. If the error is set to `undefined`, `isValid` should be `true`.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots:**\r\nThe ref:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22056205/71492387-77995200-27fc-11ea-80b2-6dc5026fe6ad.png)\r\n\r\nThe output after filling out the form:\r\n![2019-12-26 16_40_00-Window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22056205/71492650-913b9900-27fe-11ea-8a69-d3871eac854b.png)\r\n\r\n**Specifications**\r\n - OS: Windows 10 Pro, Version 1809\r\n - Browser: Google Chrome, Version 79.0.3945.88\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I can provide any further details.
