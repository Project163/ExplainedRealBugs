Add two friends\r\n2. Click submit\r\n3. See four inputs highlighted red\r\n4. Enter first name of the first friend - input will get re-validated and red highlight will disappear (as expected)\r\n5. Enter last name of the first friend - inputs for the second friend will lose their red highlight - there will be two console outputs and the errors object will look like this:\r\n\r\nFirst console output:\r\n`{\r\n  \"friends\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"firstName\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"required\",\r\n        \"message\": \"\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"lastName\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"required\",\r\n        \"message\": \"\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n} `\r\n\r\nSecond console output:\r\n`{\r\n  \"friends\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"firstName\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"required\",\r\n        \"message\": \"\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n} `\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-array-fields-qw6is\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nFriends array in `errors` object should have length of 2 and the first item in the array should be null\r\nAfter entering last name of the first friend errors object should look like this:\r\n`{\r\n  \"friends\": [\r\n    null,\r\n    {\r\n      \"lastName\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"required\",\r\n        \"message\": \"\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"firstName\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"required\",\r\n        \"message\": \"\"\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n} `\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27491471/71885340-74765e00-313a-11ea-9615-6276d3543bd1.png)\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n - Browser: Brave Version 1.2.41 Chromium: 79.0.3945.88 (Official Build)  (64-bit)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/791/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/791/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
