Because of this, there are unreported errors in controller.tsx for the exhaustive-deps rule.\r\n\r\nThe fixes are simple enough, but I don't feel confident making the changes necessary, as I don't know if the library (or some users) are relying on some of the current behavior. Dependencies can be stale in production in some cases.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Run `yarn lint:check`\r\n2. Run `npx eslint ./src/controller.tsx`\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nSorry, this one's dev only and not present in the final build.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe lint task checks all files, and no issues are reported.","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1341/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1341/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
