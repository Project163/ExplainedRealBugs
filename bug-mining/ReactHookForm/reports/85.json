So I initialise the hookForm as soon as I can, but after a while, the validation schema changes (this could also be because of some user input for example, but is automatic in my case.\r\n\r\nI had the same issue when using the old (deprecated) validationSchema and thought it might have been solved if I switched to the new validationResolver, which was not the case.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. create a hookForm with a validationResolver\r\n2. replace the resolver after it has rendered\r\n3. run the validations\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nSample is here, I just replace the resolver after 2 seconds, and it keeps using the old one:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-validationresolver-ke2fo\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhen I change the validation schema, of the validationResolver, it should always use the newest version in all validations.\r\n\r\n**Desktop:**\r\n - OS: OSX\r\n - Browser Chrome\r\n - Version Latest","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1302/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
