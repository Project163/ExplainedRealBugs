This is my first issue report so sorry in advanced if I made any mistakes :)\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nRequired validation is not triggered after using useFieldArray's \"prepend\" with \"Controller\". For the same scenario but using \"append\" (instead of \"prepend\") - it is working fine.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nUsing the example here: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-forked-sjixc, click prepend and \"submit\" (leave the new fields empty). \r\nExpected behavior - errors should be logged. \r\nActual behavior: onSubmit was called.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"399\" alt=\"array3\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29173459/126639227-3c698cfc-d78e-443e-a99f-aa163b4ea047.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: win10\r\n- Browser : chrome\r\n- Version : 91.0.4472.164\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/6052/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/6052/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
