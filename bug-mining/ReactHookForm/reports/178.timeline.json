the bug**\r\nDeconstructing `register` from `useForm` triggers `@typescript-eslint` error [`unbound-method`](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/v4.1.0/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/unbound-method.md)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nUse ESlint with a rule mentioned above.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nCodeSandbox does not support ESlint (https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client/issues/1933)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`register` is not a method that depends on `this` context, so should not trigger a warning. **`handleSubmit` doesn't**.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-09-11

is my attempt to fix #3500 (there is a motivation behind these changes)\r\n\r\n* replaced all `TControl` with `FieldValues` + `Control<FV>` combination\r\n* removed `FieldValuesFromControl` type since now `FieldValues` are used directly and no need to infer them from `(T)Control`\r\n\r\nTODO (need help or yes/no)\r\n\r\n- [ ] how to test these changes? Since this bug doesn't appear in dev, but it can be reproduced locally if types are imported from `./dist` instead of `./src`\r\n- [x] there are multiple bugs fixed by the TControl solution, if anyone remembers the issues I'd check them out for possible regression\r\n\r\n**Update:** I found 3 more mentions of this bug so far: #2700 #2984 #3002\r\nAll of them with no such error on this revision: https://codesandbox.io/s/crazy-moon-kh79k\r\n\r\nPS: branch name should be `controller-generics-contravariance` :P","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3501/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7587321330,"node_id":"LOE_lADOCl-cD84qQCB6zwAAAAHEPVXy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/7587321330","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-14T06:21:05Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
