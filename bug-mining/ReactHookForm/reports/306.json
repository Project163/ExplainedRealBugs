That makes me unable to set `defaultValue` to the field. The error shown as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nType '{ from: Date; to: Date; }' is not assignable to type 'NestedValue<{ from: Date; to: Date; }>'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nForm field types\r\n```typescript\r\ninterface FormFields {\r\n  rentalRange: NestedValue<{\r\n    from: Date;\r\n    to: Date;\r\n  }>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nController\r\n```jsx\r\n        <Controller\r\n          control={control}\r\n          name=\"rentalRange\"\r\n          defaultValue={{ from: rentalDate, to: returnDate }}\r\n          rules={{ required: true }}\r\n          render={({ field: { onChange, value } }) => (\r\n            <>\r\n              <input type=\"date\" />\r\n\r\n              <input type=\"date\" />\r\n              {/* more logic omited... */}\r\n            </>\r\n          )}\r\n        />\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Define types for form fields. One of the field (field A) is typed with `NestedValue<TypeOfA>`\r\n2. Use `Controller` to render field A\r\n3. Set `defaultValue` property to field A, with correct structure of `TypeOfA`\r\n4. TS complier shows error on `defaultValue` property.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/condescending-lehmann-otski?file=/src/App.tsx\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n- TS complier not complaining about `defaultValue` property\r\n- Or, displaying `error.message` without using `NestedValue`\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: MacOS\r\n- Browser Chrome\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI am using v7.9.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5787/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5787/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
