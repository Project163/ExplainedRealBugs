Click the \"Submit\" button. Console logs will be displayed. 😄\r\n2. Click the \"APPEND\" button.\r\n3. Click the \"Submit\" button. No console logs will be displayed, but this is intended. 😄\r\n4. Click the \"DELETE\" button.\r\n5. Click the \"Submit\" button. Again, no console logs will be displayed (!) 🙁\r\n\r\nI also confirmed that if formState.errors or formState.isValid are referenced in the component, console logs are displayed in step 5.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n1. Click the \"Submit\" button. Console logs will be displayed. 😄\r\n2. Click the \"APPEND\" button.\r\n3. Click the \"Submit\" button. No console logs will be displayed, but this is intended. 😄\r\n4. Click the \"DELETE\" button.\r\n5. Click the \"Submit\" button. Console logs will be displayed. 😄\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is the intended behavior, is there any way to allow submitting without referencing formState?\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9383/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9383/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
