Version Number\r\n\r\n7.23.0\r\n\r\n### Codesandbox/Expo snack\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/sharp-joliot-5cb75?file=/src/App.js\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use sandbox, observe the same form rendered twice, once normally and once in a portal.\r\n2. The normal form works fine but the portaled form only allows the _last_ option to be registered. use the submit button to see this in action\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nShouldn't this work the same in both cases? Perhaps this is because of some unusualness with my `Portal` implementation, but note this is very similar to the portal example from the official React docs.\r\n\r\nAfter some debugging, I think this is a related issue to https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/6776, though not exactly the same. I think this comes down to this `live` check for radio and checkbox inputs. In the version I originally discovered this in (`7.22`), there's a `document.contains(el)` check, which won't be true when the refs are registered, since the `useEffect` hasn't attached the portal to the DOM yet. I know in newer versions, the form submission now causes a crash. Unfortunately, even if this crash is fixed, I believe latest version will use `el.isConnected` which is still falsy before the `useEffect` runs.\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\nFirefox, Chrome\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nTypeError\r\ne.refs[0] is undefined\r\nz\r\nhttps://5cb75.csb.app/node_modules/react-hook-form/dist/index.cjs.js:1:4551\r\nhandleSubmit/<\r\nhttps://5cb75.csb.app/node_modules/react-hook-form/dist/index.cjs.js:1:18951\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/7515/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/7515/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7567137769,"node_id":"LOE_lADOCl-cD849A5zFzwAAAAHDCVvp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/7567137769","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-12T00:02:45Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
