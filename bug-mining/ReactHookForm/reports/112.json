Follow the Sandbox link posted below\r\n2. Try the first app (<App1 />) which is setup as FormContext. When you click \"remove\" the `dirty` property is unchanged.\r\n3. Try the second app (<App2 />) which is setup as a regular `useForm`. When you click \"remove\" the `dirty` property updates.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-lq3ld?file=/src/index.js\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would expect the `dirty` property to update when a field array item is removed regardless of whether the form is using FormContext or regular form.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n - Browser: Chrome","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1787/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
