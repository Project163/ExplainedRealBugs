Register radio buttons *but* with `{ disabled: false }` as an option like for example `{...register(\"theme\", { disabled: false })}`\r\n2. Specify a `defaultValues` for one of these radio buttons\r\n3. Nothing is `checked` by default\r\n4. Now remove `{ disabled: false }` like for example `{...register(\"theme\")}`\r\n5. The radio button is `checked` as it should be\r\n\r\nSo it seems that `disabled`, even when set to `false`, prevents the checked state to be set.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n`{...register(\"theme\", { disabled: false })}` should behave the same as `{...register(\"theme\")}` and a radio button should always be checked when `defaultValues` was set for it.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11821/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11821/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
