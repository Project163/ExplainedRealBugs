@impzero , after reading the discussions it sounds to me like it's a different issue. Eventually, the root cause might be the same but that's unlikely, I guess. In my case, I'm not dealing with an `any` type but the new `Merge` construct from v7.33.0 (released after the linked discussion was created). This `Merge` somehow completely ignores optional properties, as they are not defined at all.\r\n\r\nSo in my example above, `errors.foo?` should have the type `FieldError | FieldErrors<{ bar: string }> | undefined` but instead it's only `FieldError | undefined`.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/1168568133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Chaoste","id":9327071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMjcwNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9327071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaoste","html_url":"https://github.com/Chaoste","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaoste/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaoste/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaoste/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaoste/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaoste/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaoste/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaoste/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaoste/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Chaoste/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6892919840,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCl-cD85MofXozwAAAAGa2Zwg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/6892919840","actor":{"login":"lyubchev","id":35530157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTMwMTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35530157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev","html_url":"https://github.com/lyubchev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-28T10:55:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6892919848,"node_id":"SE_lADOCl-cD85MofXozwAAAAGa2Zwo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/6892919848","actor":{"login":"lyubchev","id":35530157,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NTMwMTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35530157?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev","html_url":"https://github.com/lyubchev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyubchev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-28T10:55:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"anark","id":101184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anark","html_url":"https://github.com/anark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-28T15:41:40Z","updated_at":"2022-06-28T15:41:40Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/8589","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/8589/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rea

Version Number\n\n7.33\n\n### Codesandbox/Expo snack\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/amazing-saha-izugnp?file=/src/App.tsx\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI have an form values with nested values like this:\r\n`attachment: {\r\n    data: string;\r\n    type: string;\r\n}`\r\n\r\nlater in the errors object, I have a type error in: `errors?.attachment?.type?.message`\r\nHere is a screenshot of

is because of the merge. Now attachment has a type FieldError which has it is own \"type\" property and that interferes with the \"type\" property in my form values\r\n\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\n\"attachment\" should not have type FieldError but maybe something like this:\r\n`attachment: {\r\n    data: FieldError;\r\n    type: FieldError;\r\n}`\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n###
