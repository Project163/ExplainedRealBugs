This is done by passing `shouldUnregister` to `useForm` and watching the values. This is a demonstration of a bug in a larger more complex component, so I need to be able to just watch all the values rather than watching individual values. By default in this example all are checked so all are shown. If you uncheck the second one, the third one should be hidden and the value unregistered. If you uncheck the first one, the second should be hidden and unregistered and if it wasn't already, the third should also hide and unregister.\r\n\r\nTo Reproduce:\r\n1. Uncheck the \"First\" field.\r\n2. Notice that the \"Third\" field is still shown and the \"values\" logged in the console are \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"first\": false,\r\n  \"second\": true,\r\n  \"third\": true,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nI would expect that values that are returned from `watch` or `useWatch` should match the values that would be submitted. In this case, that should be just \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"first\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\nsince the other 2 fields should be unregistered. \r\n\r\nCurrently it is \r\n```json \r\n{\r\n  \"first\": false,\r\n  \"third\": true\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich shows that the second field is getting correctly unregistered, but because the logic for that is using `watch` the third field doesn't get unregistered.\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/6193/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/6193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
