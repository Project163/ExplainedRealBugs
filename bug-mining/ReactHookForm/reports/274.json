I'm trying to do the same as the OP, just using `useController` instead of `register`.\r\n> \r\n> Sure, can u give some more detail and a codesandbox to show case the problem?\r\n\r\nLike the OP, I'm trying to share the ref usage, but I'm doing it inside of a component which uses `useController`. The ref returned in the `ControllerRenderProps` of the `UseControllerReturn` has the type `Ref<any>` which Typescript deems not callable.\r\n\r\nSee the following codesandbox for a reproduction: https://codesandbox.io/s/sharp-allen-obk9k?file=/src/App.tsx:424-439\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @larrifax in https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4696#issuecomment-834120417_","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5065/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5065/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
