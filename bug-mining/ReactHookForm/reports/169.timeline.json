the bug**\r\nI use react-hook-form 3.23.0. I am not to be able to use setValue on type=\"hidden\" input fields, while setValue works OK on default input fields.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI have this simple component using semantic-ui-react.\r\n```\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\nimport useForm from \"react-hook-form\";\r\nimport {Form,Button,Radio} from \"semantic-ui-react\";\r\n\r\nconst MyForm: React.FC = props => {\r\n  const { register, handleSubmit, setValue } = useForm();\r\n\r\n  const onSubmit = (formData) => console.log(formData);\r\n\r\n  let data = {\r\n    start: true\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>\r\n         <Form.Field>\r\n          <label>Start?</label>\r\n          <input\r\n            type=\"hidden\"\r\n            name=\"start\"\r\n            defaultValue={data.start.toString()}\r\n            ref={register({required: true})}\r\n          />\r\n\r\n          <Radio toggle name=\"start_toggle\" defaultChecked={data.start}\r\n                    onChange={(e, radio) => {\r\n                        setValue(\"start\", radio.checked)\r\n                      }\r\n                    } />\r\n        </Form.Field>\r\n        <Button primary type=\"submit\">\r\n          Submit\r\n        </Button>\r\n      </Form>\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default MyForm;\r\n```\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI want to use Semantic UI's Radio component visualized as a toggle. I would like to store the value of the toggle in a backing field (name=\"start\"). When I have a type=\"hidden\" as the backing field the value always remains \"true\" (clicking submit logs the form value and start is always \"true\" there). However if I remove type=\"hidden\" and have a default text field then everything works fine and the value of \"start\" matches the state of the toggle.\r\n\r\nIs there anything special in the handling of hidden inputs? Or what am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks!
