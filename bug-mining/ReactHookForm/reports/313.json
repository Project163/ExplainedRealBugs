Create a form using the useForm hook\r\n2. Create a new form field using a Controller component\r\n3. Create a new array field with useFieldArray\r\n4. Trigger a `remove` call and if one of the keys is null/undefined it'll throw an array access error\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/gracious-buck-3nx3u\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt should remove the triggered item from the useFieldArray hook\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWe could've missed something in the docs regarding sharing the form control between the two but this seems like an unintended side effect from using the controller\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5942/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5942/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
