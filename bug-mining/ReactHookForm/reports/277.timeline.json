Duplicates\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Latest version\r\n\r\n- [X] I have tested the latest version\r\n\r\n### Current behavior 😯\r\n\r\nWith the new update of the version `\"@mui/x-data-grid\": \"5.2.0\"`, I have the following problem:\r\n\r\nWhen I define my `GridColumns`, if I write\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalueGetter: (params: GridValueGetterParams) => {\r\n    return TransformFunction(params.value)\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nI going to have the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProperty 'value' does not exist on type 'GridValueGetterParams<any, any>'.\r\nProperty 'value' does not exist on type 'GridValueGetterSimpleParams<any>'.ts(2339)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't have this problem with the  version `5.1.0`.\r\nEven though it fails me when writing that, it really does bring me the `value` parameter. Should be type declaration bug.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior 🤔\r\n\r\nShould accept the parameter `value`, because exists.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce 🕹\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n1. Define the columns value like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvalueGetter: (params: GridValueGetterParams) => {\r\n    return TransformFunction(params.value)\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `TransformFunction` is any function to transform the value I receive to another\r\n\r\n2. Im going to have \r\n\r\n```\r\nProperty 'value' does not exist on type 'GridValueGetterParams<any, any>'.\r\nProperty 'value' does not exist on type 'GridValueGetterSimpleParams<any>'.ts(2339)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. If I check the existing values in `params`, there is a `value` parameter\r\n\r\n\r\n### Context 🔦\r\n\r\nI feel like it's OK to have a more general way of finding a value, other than\r\n\r\n```\r\nparams.row.field1\r\nparams.row.field2\r\nparams.row.field3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Your environment 🌎\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>`npx @mui/envinfo`</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 12.0.1\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 14.17.6 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.11 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.14.15 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: Not Found\r\n    Edge: Not Found\r\n    Firefox: Not Found\r\n    Safari: 15.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @emotion/react: 11.7.1 => 11.7.1 \r\n    @emotion/styled: 11.6.0 => 11.6.0 \r\n    @mui/base:  5.0.0-alpha.62 \r\n    @mui/icons-material: 5.2.5 => 5.2.5 \r\n    @mui/material: 5.2.6 => 5.2.6 \r\n    @mui/private-theming:  5.2.3 \r\n    @mui/styled-engine: 5.2.6 => 5.2.6 \r\n    @mui/styles: 5.2.3 => 5.2.3 \r\n    @mui/system:  5.2.6 \r\n    @mui/types:  7.1.0 \r\n    @mui/utils:  5.2.3 \r\n    @mui/x-data-grid: 5.2.0 => 5.2.0 \r\n    @types/react: 17.0.38 => 17.0.38 \r\n    react: 17.0.2 => 17.0.2 \r\n    react-dom: 17.0.2 => 17.0.2 \r\n    styled-components: 5.3.3 => 5.3.3 \r\n    typescript: 4.5.4 => 4.5.4 \r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Order ID 💳 (optional)\r\n\r\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mui/mui-x/issues/3548/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mui/mui-x/issues/3548/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7568514614,"node_id":"LOE_lADOCl-cD840sGqCzwAAAAHDHl42","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/7568514614","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-12T06:08:06Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
