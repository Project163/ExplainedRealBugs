Go to https://codesandbox.io/s/react-keepdirtyvalues-forked-l2h95t?file=/src/App.js\r\n2. Click on \"Add row\"\r\n3. Click on \"Start fetch\"\r\n4. Observe that after 3s the \"users\" field is reset to its default value (i.e. an empty array), despite being dirty (i.e. it contains one row) and have `keepDirtyValues` set.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nFields containing array values should work with `keepDirtyValues`.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a simplified example and I can't use `useFieldArray` in my real code as the field name is dynamic. (I'm building a form builder so all field names are dynamic and only known at runtime).\r\n\r\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n### Relevant log output\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12097/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12097/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
