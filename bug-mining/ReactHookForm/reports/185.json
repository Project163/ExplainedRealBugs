When I reset the form, the dirtyFields become empty again. So far so good.\r\nBut when I append (or prepend or insert) a new row to the fieldArray, **two rows** are added to dirtyFields. If I repeat reset and append, more and more rows appear in dirtyFields.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to [forked CodeSandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-forked-os2r7)\r\n2. Click on Append (or prepend or insert at)\r\n3. Click on Reset\r\n4. Click on Append (or prepend or insert at)\r\n5. Optionally repeat as many times as you like\r\n6. Scroll down to the last paragraph about the formState.dirtyFields\r\n4. See the always growing array in it\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-usefieldarray-forked-os2r7\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nreset **permanently** resets form state, dirtyFields only contains the current fields' dirtiness state\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: Win 10\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Version 85\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nreact-hook-form version 6.9.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
