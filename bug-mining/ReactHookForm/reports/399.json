Go to [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-bug-form-state-ysd0lv?file=/src/App.js)\r\n2. On the UI, append and remove some items on the `Field Array`\r\n3. Notice that `Input With Error` and `Controlled Input` render counter is the same as `Field Array`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nI expected that subscribing to specific errors by providing `name` would only re-render at the hook level when that specific field has an error:\r\n```\r\n// re-render only if `address` field has error\r\nconst { errors } = useFormState({ name: 'address' })\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Investigation\r\nI investigated a bit and I think that it happens because:\r\n- `append` and `remove` from `useFieldArray` calls `control._updateFieldArray`\r\n- [_updateFieldArray](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/blob/master/src/logic/createFormControl.ts#L217-L222) publish to `observers` without providing a specific name.\r\n- [useFormState](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/blob/master/src/useFormState.ts#L64-L82) subscription guard calls `shouldSubscribeByName`\r\n- [shouldSubscribeByName](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/blob/master/src/logic/shouldSubscribeByName.ts#L8-L11) without `signalName` returns true\r\n- Consequently every subscriber to `useFormState` updates.\r\n\r\n### Extra notes\r\n\r\nIf it's not the expected behavior, I'm willing to work on this 🙋‍♂️! (probably on the weekend) \r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9430/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9430/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
