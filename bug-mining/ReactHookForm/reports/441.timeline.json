quite sure whether to categorize this as a bug as it seems to me that this is a design decision, so I'll hold off on that for now.\r\n\r\nUsing `useWatch<T>()` (without providing any parameters) returns a deep partial unlike the `watch` type from `useFormContext`. This results in having to either cast the result to the non-partial value (`T`) or `@ts-ignore` the type in order to get my defined type instead of the deep partial one. \r\n\r\nI can't actually just use the `useFormContext#watch` because that results in infinite updates when I try to use it the same way I use `useWatch` and gives me performance issues so I've moved away from using it even though the typing there is what I need.\r\n\r\nA possible workaround is to modify the data model and add a new level like so:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { useWatch } from \"react-hook-form\";\r\n\r\ntype Form = {\r\n  name: string;\r\n  age: number;\r\n};\r\n\r\ntype HelperText = {\r\n  form: Form;\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst data = useWatch<Form>();\r\n\r\nconst nonPartialData = useWatch<HelperText, 'form'>({ name: 'form' });\r\n\r\ndata.age; // number | undefined\r\ndata.name; // string | undefined\r\n\r\nnonPartialData.age; // number\r\nnonPartialData.name; // string\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut that feels like a workaround. It would be nice to be able to use the non deep partial type just like useContext's watch does it, unless there's a reason for the type being like this and it would go against react-hook-form's intended design.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @Zetxus in https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/discussions/10610_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/10721/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/10721/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9970802325,"node_id":"LE_lADOCl-cD85tA-szzwAAAAJSTl6V","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/9970802325","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-08-01T01:18:03Z","label":{"name":"TS","color":"638acc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/1723053289","html_url":"https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/10734#issuecomment-1723053289","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/10734","id":1723053289,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCl-cD85ms7Tp","user":{"login":"SebDelile","id":75162920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1MTYyOTIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75162920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebDelile","html_url":"https://github.com/SebDelile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebDelile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebDelile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebDelile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebDelile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebDelile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebDelile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebDelile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebDelile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SebDelile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-18T09:29:45Z","updated_at":"2023-09-18T10:06:13Z","body":"Hello,\r\nI ran into the same issue, thanks for the work around !
