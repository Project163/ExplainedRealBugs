Go to https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/compassionate-leaf-9gsxtf\r\n3. Immediately click submit to trigger a validation error\r\n  _\"invalid\" appears below the input_\r\n4. Type something in the input\r\n5. Form stays invalid, until \"submit\" is pressed again\"\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nValidation is triggered on change and the field is updated to be `invalid: false`.\r\n\r\nInstead, validation is triggered but the field state is not updated. To see this behaviour, click the button to toggle the disabled value to `undefined` and repeat the steps.\r\n\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nFirefox, Chrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12127/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
