Version Number\n\n7.40.0\n\n### Codesandbox/Expo snack\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-isvalidating-stuck-js9gpj?file=/src/index.tsx\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Go to [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-isvalidating-stuck-js9gpj?file=/src/index.tsx)\r\n2. Focus the only input field\r\n3. Type one character\r\n4. Observe that the Submit button correctly changes state from disabled to enabled\r\n5. Type a second character into the input field\r\n6. Observe that the Submit button erroneously changes state from enabled to disabled despite the fact that the form is valid\r\n7. Look at the console logs which show that `isValidating` is stuck in `true` state, which is causing the submit button to be disabled\r\n8. Change the version of `react-hook-form` to 7.39.7 in `package.json` and observe that `isValidating` does not get stuck in `true` state after typing more than one character into the input field\r\n\r\nIf you change the form's `mode` from `onChange` to `onBlur`, you can type multiple characters into the field initially, but as soon as the field is blurred `isValidating` gets stuck in `true` state.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe `isValidating` property should update from `true` to `false` once validation has completed.  This issue seems similar to https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9251, but in this case the behavior can be reproduced consistently, and it's just using vanilla yum validation.  This behavior was introduced in 7.40.0.  It works as expected in 7.39.7 and prior.\n\n### What browsers are you seeing the problem on?\n\nChrome\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n```shell\nenabled: true \r\n{isDirty: true, isSubmitting: false, isValid: true, isValidating: false}\r\n\r\nenabled: false \r\n{isDirty: true, isSubmitting: false, isValid: true, isValidating: true}\n```\n\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\n- [X] I agree to follow this project's Code of Conduct","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9521/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/9521/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8073827491,"node_id":"LOE_lADOCl-cD85Ub44AzwAAAAHhPNSj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/8073827491","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-20T00:00:36Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12878555149,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCl-cD85Ub44AzwAAAAL_nygN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/events/12878555149","actor":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"267332da303446426b6d11b3615a0fe112c16744","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/commits/267332da303446426b6d11b3615a0fe112c16744","created_at":"2024-05-21T11:13:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
