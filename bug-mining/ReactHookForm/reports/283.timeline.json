the bug**\r\nCalling setValue for Material UI Autocomplete component when default value is \"undefined\" fails to work as expected.\r\nWhen setting default value to empty string, calling setValue returns expected results. \r\nAutocomplete is connected up using Controller component as per documentation. \r\n\r\nPotentially related to, but not exactly the same as #5276\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-v7-controller-forked-683yc?file=/src/index.js)\r\n2. Scroll down to the new set country button (below MUI autocomplete section which is enabled).\r\n3. Verify that country is empty.\r\n4. Click set country button.\r\n5. This is the bug, nothing happens. I would expect to see country now display \"New Zealand\" but it's still empty. \r\n\r\nTemporary workaround: \r\n1. Scroll up to line 41 of index.js and change `country: undefined,` to `country: \"\"`\r\n2. Reload the app, and repeat steps 3 and 4.\r\n3. Clicking set country when default is empty string works as expected. \r\n\r\nAs country is an object I would expect that I can leave it empty by defaulting it to undefined.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-v7-controller-forked-683yc?file=/src/index.js\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: MacOS\r\n- Browser: Edge\r\n- Version: 90.0.818.62 (Official build) (64-bit)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem
