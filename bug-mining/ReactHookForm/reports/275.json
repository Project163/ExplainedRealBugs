EX: \r\n\r\n```\r\nReact.useEffect(() => {\r\n  setValue(\"names\", [{ name: \"will\" }]);\r\n}, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**And** then later on we try and update an index of the same field array using `setValue`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst changeValue = () => {\r\n  setValue(`names.${index}`, {\r\n    name: \"updated\"\r\n  });\r\n}; \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Then** formValue will **not** update\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the sandbox\r\n2. Click on the change value button\r\n3. Notice that the value does not change\r\n4. Comment out line 48 or replace line 48 with lines 51-53.\r\n5. Notice that it works now.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/pensive-hofstadter-chm2i?file=/src/App.js:302-310\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would expect a call of `setValue` to not affect future calls of `setValue`. While we can use reset here as a workaround, I think this should work. Additionally, I know in this example it would be better to use default values, but in my project, I need to use either `setValue` or `reset` to initlize the form.","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5089/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
