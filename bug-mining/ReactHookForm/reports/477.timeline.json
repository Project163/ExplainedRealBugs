popular ORM in the TypeScript ecosystem. Today’s release brings a bunch of new bug fixes and overall improvements:\n\n- `prisma init` now creates a `prisma.config.ts` automatically\n\nWhen creating a new project with 6.18.0, `prisma init` will now create a `prisma.config.ts` file automatically. This prepares new applications for the future of Prisma 7. Some fields that have been historically set in the `schema.prisma` file are now able to be set in the `prisma.config.ts`, and we encourage people to migrate over to the new structure before the release of version 7, where this file will become a requirement.\n\n- Support for defining your `datasource` in `prisma.config.ts`\n\nIf you’re adopting the new `prisma.config.ts` setup in your projects, version 6.18.0 brings the ability to set your datasource directly in your config file. Once this is in your config file, any datasource set in your `schema.prisma` will be ignored.  To set the datasource, we also must include the new `engine` key which we can set to `\"classic\"` , which will be required for Prisma v7\n\n```tsx\nimport { defineConfig, env } from \"prisma/config\";\nexport default defineConfig({\n    // The Rust-compiled schema engine \n    engine: \"classic\",\n    datasource: {\n        url: env('DATABASE_URL'),\n    }\n});\n```\n\n- [#&#8203;28291](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/28291) Support multiple Prisma instances with different providers\n- [#&#8203;28305](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/28305) Add `env` helper function\n- [#&#8203;28266](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/28266) Add support for `js` or `classic` as engine types in `prisma.config`\n- [#&#8203;28139](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/28139) Map `Bytes` to `Uint8Array` depending on Typescript version\n\n##### Preparing for Prisma v7\n\nWhile it has been mentioned a few times already, many of the changes in this release are here to prepare folks for the upcoming release of Prisma v7. It’s worth repeating that these changes and the migration to `prisma.config.ts` will be required for Prisma v7, so we’re releasing this as opt-in features for developers. But come Prisma v7, they will be the new way of configuring your project.\n\n##### [Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres)\n\n[Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres) is our fully managed Postgres service designed with the same philosophy of great DX that has guided Prisma for close to a decade. With this release we are introducing the following improvements:\n\n##### Database Metric in Console\n\nInside of your database console, you can now view metrics on your database usage and interactions. You can get insights into the follow:\n\n- Total egress\n- Average response size\n- Average query duration\n\nIn addition, you can also get insights into how to improve your query caching and gain better performance.\n\n##### Open roles at Prisma\n\nInterested in joining Prisma? We’re growing and have several exciting opportunities across the company for developers who are passionate about building with Prisma.

This update is recommended for all users who have any fields marked as `Unsupported` in their schema files.\n\n#### Changes\n\n- [prisma/prisma-engines#5633](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/pull/5633)\n\n### [`v6.17.0`](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.17.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/compare/6.16.3...6.17.0)\n\nToday, we are excited to share the `6.17.0` stable release 🎉\n\n**🌟 Star this repo for notifications about new releases, bug fixes & features — or [follow us on X](https://pris.ly/x)!**\n\n#### Prisma ORM\n\nPrisma ORM is the most popular ORM in the TypeScript ecosystem. Today's release brings a number of bug fixes and improvements to Prisma ORM.\n\n##### Bug fixes and improvements\n\n- Added support for Entra ID (ActiveDirectory) authentication parameters for the MS SQL Server driver adapter. For example, you can use the `config` object to configure [DefaultAzureCredential](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/developer/javascript/sdk/authentication/credential-chains#use-defaultazurecredential-for-flexibility):\n  ```ts\n  import { PrismaMssql } from '@&#8203;prisma/adapter-mssql'\n  import { PrismaClient } from '@&#8203;prisma/client'\n\n  const config = {\n    server: 'localhost',\n    port: 1433,\n    database: 'mydb',\n    authentication: {\n      type: 'azure-active-directory-default',\n    },\n    options: {\n      encrypt: true,\n    },\n  }\n\n  const adapter = new PrismaMssql(config)\n  const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })\n  ```\n  Learn more in this  [PR](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/28156/files#diff-351f5d894309f058776099c378e3956271f34f34c04e2b54576045b9773ab61aR61-R62).\n- Relaxed the support package range for `@opentelemetry/instrumentation` to be compatible with `\">=0.52.0 <1\"`.

With this release we are introducing the following improvements:\n\n##### New usage workspace metrics available in your Console Dashboard\n\nThe Dashboard in your [Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io) account now displays new metrics about your Prisma Postgres usage:\n\n- Key metrics\n  - Estimated upcoming invoice\n  - Total storage used\n  - Total DBs\n- Overall usage\n  - Cumulative operations\n  - Operations per day\n\n##### Using Prisma Postgres with any tool is ready for production\n\nPreviously, the only way to connect to Prisma Postgres was using Prisma ORM. That combination is great because it gives you connection pooling, global caching and overall an amazing DX.\n\nThat being said, we understand that preferences vary and some developers prefer to use plain SQL or lower-level query builders in their applications. As of this release, these ways for connecting to Prisma Postgres are now officially generally available and can be used in your production apps!\n\nYou can connect using Drizzle, Kysely, TypeORM, `psql`, or *any other* Postgres-compatible library, database migration [tools like Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/) or interfaces like DBeaver, Postico, and more.\n\n📚 Learn more in the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/database/direct-connections).\n\n#### Enterprise support\n\nThousands of teams use Prisma and many of them already tap into our Enterprise & Agency Support Program for hands-on help with everything from schema integrations and performance tuning to security and compliance.\n\nWith this program you also get priority issue triage and bug fixes, expert scalability advice, and custom training so that your Prisma-powered apps stay rock-solid at any scale. Learn more or join: <https://prisma.io/enterprise>.\n\n### [`v6.16.3`](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.16.3)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/compare/6.16.2...6.16.3)\n\nToday, we are issuing a 6.16.3 patch release focused on bug fixes.\n\n#### 🛠 Fixes\n\n- **Prisma Client** (`prisma-client` generator): fixed missing JSON null type definitions (`JsonNull`, `DbNull`, `AnyNull`) in the `browser.ts` entrypoint. *([#&#8203;28186](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/28186))*\n\n- **Prisma Migrate**: don't add the default schema (namespace) to the generated migrations unless it was specified explicitly in the schema file. This restores the pre-6.13.0 behaviour that was inadvertently changed with enabling multi-schema support by default. Users who rely on database schemas for multi-tenancy can now again use the same migration files for all of their schemas. *([prisma/prisma-engines#5614](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/pull/5614))*\n\n- **Prisma Client**: enabled negative `take` with `findFirst` again. *([prisma/prisma-engines#5616](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma-engines/pull/5616) — contributed by [@&#8203;jay-l-e-e](https://redirect.github.com/jay-l-e-e))*\n\n- **Prisma Accelerate**: aligned the behaviour of the new Rust-free client with Query Engine to handle self-signed certificates consistently and ensure backward compatibility.  *([#&#8203;28134](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/28134))*\n\n- **`@prisma/adapter-mariadb`**: fixed error event listeners leak. *([#&#8203;28177](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/28177) — contributed by [@&#8203;Tiaansu](https://redirect.github.com/Tiaansu))*\n\n#### ⚠️ Known Limitation: JSON null types in browser builds\n\nThe fix introduces the missing types, but the singleton instances differ between the client and browser entrypoints of the generated client. This means that values like `Prisma.JsonNull` imported from browser cannot yet be assigned to fields expected from the client entrypoint, and vice versa. This results in confusing TypeScript errors if you mix them. A follow-up improvement is planned to unify these utility types across entrypoints.\n\n### [`v6.16.2`](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.16.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/compare/6.16.1...6.16.2)\n\nToday, we are issuing a 6.16.2 patch release.\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- In Prisma ORM 6.16.0, we've enabled usage of the new `engineType = client` with Prisma Postgres, but our validation rules permitted invalid combinations of Prisma Postgres URLs and driver adapters. This now produces a clear error message indicating Prisma Postgres URLs and driver adapters are mutually exclusive.\n- In the previous minor release, we've included a change that calls `unref()` on NodeJS timers to prevent them from keeping the NodeJS event loop active. This change unintentionally affected non-NodeJS runtimes like `workerd`, where it has resulted in runtime errors. This behavior has been made conditional to prevent these runtime errors.\n\n### [`v6.16.1`](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.16.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/compare/6.16.0...6.16.1)\n\nToday, we are issuing a 6.16.1 patch release.\n\n#### Bug fixes\n\n- In Prisma ORM 6.16.0, the `driverAdapters` and `queryCompiler` features were stabilized, but leftover code in the `prisma-client-ts` generator required them to still be specified in edge runtimes. This has now been fixed, runtimes like `workerd` and `vercel-edge` no longer require these preview features.\n\n### [`v6.16.0`](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.16.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/compare/6.15.0...6.16.0)\n\nToday, we are excited to share the `6.16.0` stable release 🎉\n\n**🌟 Star this repo for notifications about new releases, bug fixes & features — or [follow us on X](https://pris.ly/x)!**\n\n#### Prisma ORM\n\nThis section contains all the updates made in Prisma ORM v6.16.0.\n\n##### Rust-free ORM and driver adapters are Generally Available\n\nEight months ago, we published our [ORM manifesto](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-orm-manifesto) with the first hint that we're going to remove the Rust-based query engine from Prisma ORM:\n\n> We're addressing this by migrating Prisma's core logic from Rust to TypeScript and redesigning the ORM to make customization and extension easier.\n\nAfter a lot of hard work and feedback from the community, we're incredibly excited to share that the migration has been completed and you can now use Prisma ORM without its Rust engine in your production apps. 🎉 This is a major milestone in the history of Prisma ORM and comes with a lot of benefits:\n\n- Reduced bundle size by \\~90%\n- Faster queries (check out our [latest benchmarks](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-orm-without-rust-latest-performance-benchmarks))\n- Lower CPU footprint\n- Less deployment complexity\n- Easier to make open-source contributions\n\n… and overall a much better DX since you don't need to worry about the extra binary in your generated Prisma Client code any more.\n\nWhile the Rust-free ORM will become the default in Prisma ORM v7 soon, for now you still need to opt-into using it:\n\n1. Configure the `generator` block in your Prisma schema:\n   ```prisma\n   generator client {\n     provider   = \"prisma-client\" // (or \"prisma-client-js\") \n     output     = \"../src/generated/prisma\"\n     engineType = \"client\"\n   }\n   ```\n   Note: If you tried the Rust-free ORM before, you can now also drop the `queryCompiler` and `driverAdapter` feature flags from the `previewFeatures` array. And if you used `binaryTargets`, you can also get rid of these.\n2. Install the [driver adapter](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/overview/databases/database-drivers#driver-adapters) for your database, e.g. to use [`pg`](https://node-postgres.com/) for PostgreSQL:\n   ```\n   npm install @&#8203;prisma/adapter-pg\n   ```\n3. Finally, you can instantiate `PrismaClient` using the `PrismaPg` driver adapter as follows:\n   ```ts\n   import { PrismaClient } from './generated/prisma'\n   import { PrismaPg } from '@&#8203;prisma/adapter-pg'\n\n   const adapter = new PrismaPg({ connectionString: env.DATABASE_URL })\n   const prisma = new PrismaClient({ adapter })\n\n   // ... send queries using `prisma` like before\n   ```\n\n📚 To learn more and see instructions for all other supported databases, check out the [documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/setup-and-configuration/no-rust-engine).\n\n> The Rust-free version of Prisma ORM has been thoroughly tested with the `prisma-client` generator (see below), not with `prisma-client-js`. Use the old generator at your discretion.\n\n##### New ESM-first `prisma-client` generator is Generally Available\n\nAnother major milestone has been achieved in this release: The new, flexible and ESM-first `prisma-client` generator is ready for production too. Here's a quick overview of its main benefits:\n\n- No more [magic generation into `node_modules`](https://www.prisma.io/blog/why-prisma-orm-generates-code-into-node-modules-and-why-it-ll-change); generated code is fully under control by the developer\n- ESM-compatible by default\n- Flexible configuration for specific runtimes (Node.js, Deno, Bun, Cloudflare, …)\n\n```prisma\ngenerator client {\n  // Required\n  provider = \"prisma-client\"\n  output   = \"../src/generated/prisma\"\n\n  // Optional\n  engineType             = \"client\"\n  runtime                = \"nodejs\"\n  moduleFormat           = \"esm\"\n  generatedFileExtension = \"ts\"\n  importFileExtension    = \"ts\"\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to making it production-ready, we also made some changes to the `prisma-client` generator:\n\n- removed `Prisma.validator`; you can use TypeScript native [`satisfies`](https://www.prisma.io/blog/satisfies-operator-ur8ys8ccq7zb) keyword instead\n- created a new `./generared/prisma/browser` entrypoint for importing types in browser environments\n\nIf you want to try out the new generator with your favorite framework, check out one of our [ready-to-run examples](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/generator-prisma-client) (e.g. for [Next.js](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/generator-prisma-client/nextjs-starter-webpack-turborepo), [Nuxt](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/generator-prisma-client/nuxt3-starter-nodejs) or [React Router](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/generator-prisma-client/react-router-starter-nodejs)).\n\n📚 Learn more in the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview/generators#prisma-client).\n\n##### Type check performance optimizations\n\nRuntime performance is not the only performance category that matters. In fact, when it comes to DX, type checking performance is equally important: if your TypeScript types become too complex and the compiler needs to do too much work (e.g. inferring types), it may slow down your editor, lead to laggy auto-completion or prevent jump-to-definition from working.\n\nWe've worked with TypeScript expert [David Blass](https://x.com/ssalbdivad) to find ways for improving the type checking performance in Prisma ORM and created benchmarks comparing the type checking performance with Drizzle.\n\nYou can read about the results here: [**Why Prisma ORM Checks Types Faster Than Drizzle**](https://www.prisma.io/blog/why-prisma-orm-checks-types-faster-than-drizzle)\n\n##### Deprecating the `postgresqlExtensions` Preview feature\n\nWe're deprecating the `postgresqlExtensions` Preview feature. Note that this doesn't mean that you can't use extensions with Prisma ORM any more. Instead of setting the Preview feature, you can install extensions manually with a [customized migration](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/customizing-migrations) via the `--create-only` flag:\n\n```\nnpx prisma migrate dev --name add-extension --create-only\n```\n\nYou can then install an extension with plain SQL in the newly created, empty migration file:\n\n```sql\nCREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"pgcrypto\";\n```\n\n#### Prisma Postgres\n\n[Prisma Postgres](https://www.prisma.io/postgres) is our fully managed Postgres service designed with the same philosophy of great DX that has guided Prisma for close to a decade. With this release we are introducing the following improvements:\n\n##### Manage OAuth apps in Prisma Console\n\n[In Prisma Console](https://console.prisma.io), you can now manage all of the 3rd party applications that you've granted access to perform actions on behalf of yourself in your Prisma Console account. Find the 🧩 **Integrations** tab in the sidenav to see which applications currently have access.\n\n##### Rust-free Prisma ORM with Prisma Accelerate and Prisma Postgres\n\nWith this release, the Rust-free Prisma ORM (Query Compiler) can now be used together with Prisma Postgres and also Prisma Accelerate. This means you can take advantage of connection pooling and caching while using the new TypeScript-based ORM architecture.\n\nTo enable it, update your Prisma schema:\n\n```prisma\ngenerator client {\n  provider   = \"prisma-client\"\n  output     = \"../src/generated/prisma\"\n  engineType = \"client\"\n}\n```\n\nWe'd love for you to try this out and share your feedback as we prepare for General Availability. Please [open an issue on GitHub](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/issues) if you encounter any problems or have suggestions.\n\n#### Enterprise support\n\nThousands of teams use Prisma and many of them already tap into our Enterprise & Agency Support Program for hands-on help with everything from schema integrations and performance tuning to security and compliance.\n\nWith this program you also get priority issue triage and bug fixes, expert scalability advice, and custom training so that your Prisma-powered apps stay rock-solid at any scale. Learn more or join: <https://prisma.io/enterprise>.\n\n### [`v6.15.0`](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.15.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/compare/6.14.0...6.15.0)\n\nToday, we are excited to share the `6.15.0` stable release 🎉\n\n**🌟 Star this repo for notifications about new releases, bug fixes & features — or [follow us on X](https://pris.ly/x)!**\n\n#### Highlights\n\n##### AI safety guardrails for destructive commands\n\nPrisma ORM now includes built-in safety checks that protect against destructive commands when triggered by AI coding assistants. The CLI can recognize when it is being executed by popular AI agents such as Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Cursor, Aider and Replit.\n\nIf a command like `prisma migrate reset --force` is attempted, Prisma ORM will prompt for explicit confirmation before proceeding.\n\n![Cursor AI guardrail](https://redirect.github.com/user-attachments/assets/81b47674-ad93-4270-b073-69fe583e34a5)\n\nThis feature ensures that irreversible operations which drop and recreate the database are not executed automatically by an AI tool. Prisma ORM is the first ORM to provide this level of protection, making it safer to use AI-assisted development while working with your databases.\n\n📚 Learn more [in the docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-cli-reference#ai-safety-guardrails-for-prisma-migrate-reset).\n\n##### `prisma-client`: runtime improvements and schema flexibility\n\nWe simplified Prisma ORM by making the runtime options for the Prisma Client more consistent and easier to understand. Previously there were several overlapping aliases which created confusion. With this release we simplified the inputs while keeping support for all the major environments you might be targeting.\n\nChanges include:\n\n- `node` has been removed, use `runtime = \"nodejs\"` instead\n- `deno-deploy` has been removed, use `runtime = \"deno\"` instead\n- `vercel` has been replaced by the new `runtime = \"vercel-edge\"`\n- `edge-light` is now just an alias for `vercel-edge`\n- `nodejs`, `deno`, and `bun` now share the same internal code path, while still keeping their separate input values for clarity\n- The VS Code extension has been updated to reflect these changes\n\nThe updated list of supported runtimes is now:\n\n`nodejs`, `deno`, `bun`, `workerd` (alias `cloudflare`), `vercel-edge` (alias `edge-light`), and `react-native`.\n\nIn addition, we fixed an issue where running `prisma generate` would fail if your schema contained no models. This is now supported with the new `prisma-client` generator, just like it already worked with the older `prisma-client-js` generator.\n\nFor example, the following schema will now generate a client without errors:\n\n```prisma\ngenerator client {\n  provider = \"prisma-client\"\n  output   = \"../generated/client\"\n}\n\ndatasource db {\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n  url      = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n}\n```\n\nRunning `prisma generate` with this schema will succeed and create the client in `./generated/client`.\n\n📚 Learn more [in the docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/overview/generators#prisma-client-preview).\n\n##### Using Prisma ORM with Vercel Fluid\n\n[Fluid compute](https://vercel.com/fluid) is a new compute model from Vercel that combines the flexibility of serverless with the stability of servers, making it ideal for dynamic workloads such as streaming data and AI APIs.\n\nA common challenge in traditional serverless platforms is that when functions are suspended, database connection pools can’t close idle connections. This leads to leaked connections that stay open until the database times them out, which can exhaust the pool.\n\nVercel provides the [`attachDatabasePool`](https://vercel.com/blog/the-real-serverless-compute-to-database-connection-problem-solved) utility to solve this problem. It ensures idle connections in the pool are properly released before a function is suspended, preventing connection leaks.\n\nYou can use this utility together with Prisma’s driver adapters to safely manage database connections in Fluid Compute:\n\n```ts\nimport { Pool } from \"pg\";\nimport { attachDatabasePool } from \"@&#8203;vercel/functions\";\nimport { PrismaPg } from \"@&#8203;prisma/adapter-pg\";\nimport { PrismaClient } from \"./generated/prisma/client\";\n\nconst pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_URL });\nattachDatabasePool(pool);\n\nconst prisma = new PrismaClient({\n  adapter: new PrismaPg(pool),\n});\n```\n\n📚 Learn more [in the docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/deployment/serverless/deploy-to-vercel#using-prisma-orm-with-vercel-fluid).\n\n#### Other news\n\n##### Prisma Postgres Management API is Generally Available\n\nThe Prisma Postgres Management API allows you to [programmatically](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/management-api-basic) provision and manage Prisma Postgres instances. It’s the perfect way to spin up a database in your CI/CD workflow, see our GitHub Action examples for [creating](https://redirect.github.com/marketplace/actions/create-prisma-postgres-database) and [deleting](https://redirect.github.com/marketplace/actions/delete-prisma-postgres-database) if you’re curious about this use case.\n\nIt also enables developers to offer databases to their own users! For example, did you know that [Co.dev](http://co.dev/) (YC23), a popular “low-code AI app builder” is [using the Management API to provision Prisma Postgres instances to people building apps with their platform](https://www.prisma.io/blog/how-co-dev-uses-prisma-postgres-to-power-ai-driven-app-development-for-non-developers)?\n\nWe’re excited to share that the Management API is now fully ready for production. With it moving into GA, we also added another piece of functionality where you can now create new projects without a default database.\n\nWe’re looking forward to see what you’re going to build with it!\n\n📚 Learn more [in the docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/introduction/management-api).\n\n##### Prisma Postgres is now available on Pipedream\n\nPrisma Postgres can now be used directly in your Pipedream workflows 🎉\n\nWith this integration, you can connect Prisma Postgres to over 2,800+ apps supported on Pipedream, enabling powerful automations and data workflows. For example, you can:\n\n- Automatically spin up a new Prisma Postgres database when a customer signs up in Stripe.\n- Connect Prisma Postgres with Slack, Notion, Airtable, or any other app in the Pipedream ecosystem\n\nThis makes it easier than ever to use Prisma Postgres in your automation pipelines, without needing to manage custom scripts or infrastructure.\n\n📚 Learn more [on the Pipedream integration page](https://pipedream.com/apps/prisma-management-api).\n\n<img width=\"1624\" height=\"994\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-08-26 at 3 15 19 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0d98f8f-362d-4887-baeb-019ed9625c66\" />\n\n##### New `--json` flag for `npx create-db`\n\nThe `npx create-db` command lets you spin up a temporary, production-ready Prisma Postgres database that you can later claim for continued use. With this release, you can now add the `--json` flag to return the database details in JSON format.\n\nThis makes it straightforward to programmatically use the connection details, whether you are building custom APIs or integrating database provisioning into your workflows.\n\n📚 Learn more [in the docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/introduction/npx-create-db).\n\n![npx create-db --json command](https://redirect.github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fa40e7c-d531-4f81-b26c-2e150c5cade3)\n\n##### Direct connections to Prisma Postgres are coming close to GA\n\nDirect connections enable you to connect to your database using any ORM library or tool of your choice (e.g. Drizzle ORM, Kysely but also database GUIs like Postico or TablePlus).\n\nIn this release, we’ve improved the robustness of direct TCP connections and are close to bringing it to General Availability.\n\n📚 Learn more [in the docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/database/direct-connections).\n\n#### Enterprise support\n\nThousands of teams use Prisma and many of them already tap into our Enterprise & Agency Support Program for hands-on help with everything from schema integrations and performance tuning to security and compliance.\n\nWith this program you also get priority issue triage and bug fixes, expert scalability advice, and custom training so that your Prisma-powered apps stay rock-solid at any scale.

Views are *virtual* tables that don't allows for defining unique constraints, indexes or foreign keys in the underlying database.\n\nHowever, as an application developer, it can be convenient to also define relationships involving views or paginate them using cursors. We've received this feedback from several people who had been using views in that way with Prisma ORM, so in this release we're re-introducing the `@unique` attribute for views. This attribute enables:\n\n- relationships involving views\n- `findUnique` queries, cursor-based pagination & implicit ordering for views\n\nHere's an example schema using `@unique` and defining a relationship from a model to a view:\n\n```prisma\nmodel User {\n  id        Int            @&#8203;id @&#8203;default(autoincrement())\n  email     String         @&#8203;unique\n  posts     Post[]\n  stats     UserPostStats? @&#8203;relation(fields: [email], references: [userEmail])\n}\n\nmodel Post {\n  id        Int      @&#8203;id @&#8203;default(autoincrement())\n  title     String\n  published Boolean  @&#8203;default(false)\n  createdAt DateTime @&#8203;default(now())\n  authorId  Int?\n  author    User?    @&#8203;relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])\n}\n\nview UserPostStats {\n  userEmail        String    @&#8203;unique\n  totalPosts       BigInt?\n  publishedPosts   BigInt?\n  unpublishedPosts BigInt?\n  latestPostDate   DateTime? @&#8203;db.Timestamp(6)\n  user             User?\n}\n```\n\n<details><summary>Expand to view the SQL code for this view</summary>\n\n```sql\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW \"UserPostStats\" AS\nSELECT \n    u.email AS \"userEmail\",\n    u.name AS \"userName\",\n    COUNT(p.id) AS \"totalPosts\",\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN p.published = true THEN 1 END) AS \"publishedPosts\",\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN p.published = false THEN 1 END) AS \"unpublishedPosts\",\n    MAX(p.\"createdAt\") AS \"latestPostDate\"\nFROM \"User\" u\nLEFT JOIN \"Post\" p ON u.id = p.\"authorId\"\nGROUP BY u.id, u.email, u.name;\n```\n\n</details>\n\nYou can now query this view and its relationship using `include`:\n\n```ts\nconst userPostStats = await prisma.userPostStats.findMany({\n  include: {\n    user: true,\n  }\n})\n```\n\n📚 Learn more in the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/views).\n\n##### Various fixes & stability improvements\n\n- Fixed several issues related to new `prisma-client` generator and the `queryCompiler` Preview feature (aka “Prisma Client without Rust engines”). Both will become the default in the upcoming Prisma 7 release and we're working hard on bringing these features into General Availability. You can try them out with your favorite stack with our [ready-to-run examples](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma-examples/tree/latest/generator-prisma-client).\n- Fixed several regressions, e.g. related to Prisma Config\n- Removed middleware from Prisma Client (i.e. the `prisma.$use` method), which was deprecated since v4.16.0. Use [Prisma Client extensions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/client-extensions) instead.\n- Deprecated `metrics` Preview feature (which will be removed in Prisma 7)\n\n##### Improved type performance\n\nIn this release, we also addressed some type performance issues that led to slower editors and lagging auto-complete. If you're curious about the details, you can check the description and changes in [this PR](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/pull/27777).\n\n#### Other news\n\n##### Increased robustness of Management API (Early Access)\n\nWe recently released an [API for programmatically managing Prisma Postgres instances](https://www.prisma.io/docs/postgres/introduction/management-api) that's perfect for CI/CD workflows and scripting.\n\nIn this release, we made it more robust and are bringing it closer to its General Availability release.\n\n##### Revoke OAuth tokens in Prisma Console\n\nIf you use OAuth to authorize third-party applications to act on your behalf in the Prisma Console, you can now revoke any app's access at any time. The Prisma Console shows a list of your authorized (connected) apps, and you can easily remove one to immediately block further access.\n\n#### ICYMI\n\n[Last release](https://pris.ly/release/6.14.0) was *huge*, so just in case you missed it, here's the TLDR of what we put out last time:\n\n- **Prisma ORM**\n  - **Prisma Config file (`prisma.config.ts`) is Generally Available** – Native way to configure schema paths, migrations, seeds, and more; no need for `earlyAccess` flag anymore.\n  - **Multi-schema support is Generally Available** – Allows assigning models to different database schemas in Postgres and SQL Server using `@@&#8203;schema`.\n  - **Improved SQL views support (still in Preview)** – Adds guardrails for views by disabling unsupported features.\n  - **Externally managed tables** – Lets you exclude specific tables from Prisma Migrate while still querying them via Prisma Client.\n- **Prisma Postgres**\n  - **Extension support for Prisma Postgres** – Prisma Postgres now supports `pgvector`, `pg_search`, `pg_stat_statements`, `citext`, `pg_trgm`, `fuzzystrmatch`, and `unaccent`. If you don't see the extension you need, you can [request it here](https://pris.ly/i-want-extensions). Extensions only work on *new* instances, if you want to use any of them on your existing instance, [reach out to us](mailto:support@prisma.io).\n  - **Management API for Prisma Postgres** – REST API to provision, delete, and manage Prisma Postgres instances programmatically, perfect for CI/CD and scripting workflows.\n  - **GitHub Actions for Prisma Postgres** – Actions for creating and deleting databases in CI/CD workflows, available on GitHub Marketplace.\n  - **New CLI: `npx create-db`** – Instantly spin up a new Postgres database—no authentication required.\n\n### [`v6.13.0`](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/6.13.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/prisma/prisma/compare/6.12.0...6.13.0)\n\nToday, we are excited to share the `6.13.0` stable release 🎉\n\n**🌟 Star this repo for notifications about new releases, bug fixes & features — or [follow us on X](https://pris.ly/x)!**\n\n#### Highlights\n\nIn this ORM release, we’re moving the Prisma Config file and the multi-schema feature into [General Availability](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/more/releases#generally-available-ga). This means these features now are fully production-ready and we’re looking forward to seeing what you are going to build with them!\n\nAdditionally, support for SQL views is getting an important update to further stabilize its API.\n\n##### Configuring Prisma via Prisma Config is now Generally Available\n\nThe [`prisma.config.ts`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference) file is Prisma ORM’s native way to provide configuration options for your project. It currently lets you specify:\n\n- the locations for various Prisma-related assets, such as your:\n  - Prisma schema file\n  - migrations\n  - SQL view definitions\n  - TypedSQL queries\n- a `seed` command to populate your database based on some executable script\n- externally managed tables (see below)\n- the driver adapters to be used by the Prisma CLI when interacting with your database\n\nHere’s an example Prisma Config file that specified custom locations for various project assets in and a seed script inside a `db` directory:\n\n```tsx\nimport path from \"node:path\";\nimport { defineConfig } from \"prisma/config\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  schema: path.join(\"db\", \"schema.prisma\"),\n  migrations: {\n    path: path.join(\"db\", \"migrations\"),\n    seed: \"tsx db/seed.ts\"\n  }\n});\n```\n\nNote that you’ll also see warning now if you defined a `prisma.seed` command in `package.json`.\n\nWe’re excited to move the [`prisma.config.ts`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference) file into General Availability. If you used it before in your projects, you can now drop `earlyAccess` from its options:\n\n```diff\nimport { defineConfig } from \"prisma/config\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n- earlyAccess: true,\n});\n```\n\nThere still are and will be fields on the Prisma Config object that are Early Access or Preview features. To opt-into these, you’ll need to explicitly declare them via a new `experimental` field.\n\nFor example, usage of `adapters` is currently still in Preview:\n\n```tsx\nimport { defineConfig } from \"prisma/config\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n    experimental: {\n      adapter: true,\n    },\n    // requires `experimental.adapter`\n    adapter: async () => {\n\t\t\t// ...\n    },\n});\n```\n\nFinally, the Prisma Config file now also supports various file extensions so it fits neatly into your individual project setups: `.js`, `.ts`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.mts`, `.cts`. It also can be defined as `.config/prisma.${extension}`, where `extension` is the same one as file extensions above.\n\n📚 Learn more [in the docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/reference/prisma-config-reference).\n\n##### Using multiple schemas in now Generally Available\n\nDatabases like PostgreSQL or SQL Server provide a way to logically organize your tables in dedicated namespaces called *schemas*. In Prisma ORM, you can assign tables to various schemas via the `@@&#8203;schema` attribute:\n\n```tsx\ndatasource db {\n  provider = \"postgresql\"\n  url      = env(\"DATABASE_URL\")\n  schemas  = [\"base\", \"shop\"]\n}\n\nmodel User {\n  id     Int     @&#8203;id\n  orders Order[]\n\n  @&#8203;@&#8203;schema(\"base\")\n}\n\nmodel Order {\n  id      Int  @&#8203;id\n  user    User @&#8203;relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])\n  userId  Int\n\n  @&#8203;@&#8203;schema(\"shop\")\n}\n```\n\nThis feature has moved into General Availability, so if you were using it before, you can now drop the `multiSchema` feature flag from the `generator` block in your Prisma schema:\n\n```diff\ngenerator client {\n  // ...\n- previewFeatures = [\"multiSchema\"]\n}\n```\n\n📚 Learn more [in the docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/multi-schema).\n\n##### More robust support for SQL views (Preview)\n\nSQL views are *virtual* tables created by a query. Unlike regular tables, views do not store data themselves; instead, they represent the result of a stored SQL query that runs whenever the view is accessed.\n\nWe continue to improve support for SQL views, making them more reliable and better aligned with Prisma’s features. In this release, we ensured that `@id`, `@index` and `@unique` can’t be used on a `view` block in the Prisma schema. Without these attributes, several other features in Prisma Client or the Prisma schema don’t make sense any more either, so we made sure that they can’t be used with views:\n\n- disabled `findUnique` queries and cursor-based pagination in Prisma Client\n- disallowed writes and implicit ordering for views in Prisma Client\n- disallowed relationships involving views in Prisma Schema\n\nThis will align the API surface of Prisma ORM with the actual capabilities of SQL views and adds guardrails so you can use views with more c\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"every weekend\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Enabled.\n\n♻ **Rebasing**: Whenever PR is behind base branch, or you tick the rebase/retry checkbox.\n\n👻 **Immortal**: This PR will be recreated if closed unmerged.
