The submit function saves the formData to the redux by an action. After that, when re-enter the input, the application show's the error `Cannot assign to read only property 'username' of object '#<Object>'`.\n\n**Work around**\nAfter doing some try and error, i realized that the form will work as expected when I remove the `resolver` or use clone function to clone object like `lodash.cloneDeep` before dispatch it to redux.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Go to: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/87j5mr\n2. Input any thing\n3. Click Submit\n4. Edit the input\n5.  See error\n\n<details>\n<summary>Screen shot</summary>\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3279455e-b7e6-4524-8e14-67f614dff78d)\n\n</details>\n\n**More information**\nActually I met this error when I was working with `react-native + expo` project. The screen is not crash like the website. But after dispatch the action, all fields was not registed to the form anymore. When `form.handleSubmit` called, the formData's value was not updated.\n\nHope someone can explain or maybe fix this \"strage\" error.\n\nThank you very much\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nThe formData from `handleSubmit` should be the `snapshot` of the form's value, not the reference or anything like that, so there will be no problem when saving it to redux","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12900/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/12900/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
