When `defaultValues` is NOT passed to the `useForm` hook, the `reset` method fails to reset `Controller` controlled components.\r\n2. When `defaultValues` IS passed to the `useForm` hook, the `reset` method fails to reset `Controller` controlled components when passed `{}`.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-rhfinput-9l5m0\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would expect the `reset` method to reset the `Controller` controlled components without the need for `defaultValues` and when passing `{}` to `reset`.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nhttps://t.co/pyJuyD3SpF?amp=1\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows, Mac OSX\r\n - Browser: Chrome\r\n - Version: 79\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- When `defaultValues` is passed and nothing is passed to `reset` it does work.\r\n- When `defaultValues` is NOT passed, conditionally rendered `Controller`s DO properly reset.\r\n- When `defaultValues` is passed and `reset` is called with `defaultValues` it DOES properly reset.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1069/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/1069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
