Go to [this sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/cranky-kapitsa-3sd8m?file=/src/App.tsx)\r\n2. Hover variables [a1, ..., j1] from the first `watch` call (The one with 10 keys) types are correct\r\n3. Hover variables [a2, ..., k2] from the second `watch` call. See the variables being falsely typed.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe types should be correct in both cases.\r\n\r\n___\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary> Potential solutions </summary>\r\n\r\nI see two solutions to get rid of this typing issue.\r\n\r\n- \"Manually\" type the watch call\r\n```ts\r\n  const [key1, ..., key11] = watch<[\"key1\", ..., \"key11\"]>([\"key1\", ..., \"key11\"]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n***Pros***: It doesn't require any changes to the current API. (and this issue can be closed right away)\r\n***Cons***: Even tho it might be a niche use case, it's a bit verbose and the DX (that I found wonderful since v7) is less enjoyable.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Make use of [the variadic tuple typing](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/39094) of TS 4.0\r\nFor what I have tested this could be done by changing [this definition](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/blob/4cb6579b03e5f2a5b22ed2c04d5b6df037b33965/src/types/form.ts#L167-L346) to:\r\n```ts\r\n  <TFieldNames extends Array<FieldPath<TFieldValues>>>(\r\n    fieldNames: readonly [...TFieldNames],\r\n    defaultValue?: UnpackNestedValue<DeepPartial<TFieldValues>>,\r\n  ): [...FieldPathValues<TFieldValues, TFieldNames>];\r\n```\r\n\r\n***Pros***: It provides a better DX imho.\r\n***Cons***:  It could potentially be a breaking change if people have typed their `watch` like so (even tho I cannot see a use case to do so):\r\n```ts\r\nwatch<\"k1\", \"k2\">([\"k1\", \"k2\"])\r\n```\r\nas it would need to be define like this afterward:\r\n```ts\r\nwatch<[\"k1\", \"k2\"]>([\"k1\", \"k2\"])\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nIf, by chance, you would like to see this implemented, I'll be more than happy to create a PR.","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/4994/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
