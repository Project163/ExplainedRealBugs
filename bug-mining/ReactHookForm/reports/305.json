Go to the code sandbox\r\n2. English is displayed in the textfield\r\n3. Switch to DE\r\n4. English ist still displayed, but Deutsch should appear\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/rhf-basic-muitabs-icp7m\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhen switching the tabs, the value in the textfield should reflect the field value for the corresponding language.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: linux\r\n- Browser chrome/firefox\r\n- Version 87/89\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWhen pressing \"console log form state\" after startup, the log shows\r\n```\r\n{lang: {en: {name: \"English\"}}}\r\n```\r\nwhich is ok so far, but after switching (without typing anything)\r\n```\r\n{lang: {de: {name: \"English\"}}}\r\n```\r\nthis is wrong, it looks like that the value got overwritten.</div>","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/5777/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
