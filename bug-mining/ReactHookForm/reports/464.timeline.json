whatever comments I have regarding the tracking process here.*\r\n\r\n### ✅ radix-ui\r\n\r\n- ~React 19 support is being tracked in the open PR.~\r\n- ~The branch has been merged in and released as a 'release candidate' under the `next` tag (`-rc.4`).~\r\n- Radix has pushed the changes to main.\r\n\r\n### 🚨 recharts\r\n\r\n- React 19 support is being tested in the releases tagged under `alpha`.\r\n\r\n### 🚨 cmdk\r\n\r\n- The packages uses primitives by radix-ui, so it can be expected that React 19 support should follow soon after the Radix PR goes through.\r\n\r\n### ✅ react-hook-form\r\n\r\n- ~The `form.watch` doesn't work when the react-compiler is turned on, unless you memorize the watcher with an eslint ignore.~\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst form_checkoutDate = React.useMemo(\r\n    () => form.watch(\"checkoutDate\"),\r\n    // eslint-disable-next-line react-compiler/react-compiler\r\n    // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps\r\n    [form.watch(\"checkoutDate\")]\r\n);\r\n```\r\n-  The workaround is to use the [`useWatch`](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/usewatch) hook to not have to trick the react-compiler using `useMemo`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SeanCassiere/nv-rental-clone/issues/362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SeanCassiere/nv-rental-clone/issues/362/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/comments/2174761319","html_url":"https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11910#issuecomment-2174761319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/11910","id":2174761319,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCl-cD86BoDln","user":{"login":"mwskwong","id":32725014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzI1MDE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32725014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwskwong","html_url":"https://github.com/mwskwong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwskwong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwskwong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwskwong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwskwong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwskwong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwskwong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwskwong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwskwong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwskwong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-18T01:52:07Z","updated_at":"2024-06-18T01:52:07Z","body":"@bluebill1049 @josephsavona So can I conclude that, at this stage, if we still want/need to use `watch()` with React Compiler enabled, there are two workarounds:\r\n\r\nOption 1: replace `watch()` with `useWatch()`\r\n```diff\r\n  const { control, watch } = useForm();\r\n- const field = watch('field');\r\n+ const field = useWatch({ name: 'field', control })\r\n```\r\n\r\nOption 2: opt out of optimization with `use no memo` for components using `watch()`\r\n```diff\r\n  const Component = () => {\r\n+   'use no memo'\r\n    const { control, watch } = useForm();\r\n    const field =
