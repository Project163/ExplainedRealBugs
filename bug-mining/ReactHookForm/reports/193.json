Go to sandbox\r\n2. Remove 'Afghanistan' option. **dirtyFields will set 'true' for countries.**\r\n3. Re-select 'Afghanistan' option. **dirtyFields of countries is still 'true'.**\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\n- [Material UI Autocomplete Multiple](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-6-controller-forked-mow4i?file=/src/MuiAutoComplete.js) Template\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n**dirtyFields** behaviour should be same for all types of values. i.e (string, number, array). Ideally, the dirtyFields should not include countries in the above case as the selected option (Afghanistan) is the same when the form was initally loaded and at the end of the third step. \r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: [macOs Catalina]\r\n- Browser [chrome]\r\n- Version [e.g. 81]\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI'm have'nt gone through how the dirtyFields are being built in react-hook-form. But for reference types values like arrays, I think we need to compare it with its values instead of their references.","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3261/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/3261/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
