The value is set to true as soon the async function ran, without waiting for it to finish.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\nI used the code from the \"AsyncSubmitValidation\" example as base.\r\nSo basically go to the codesanbox, leave the form as is and try to submit it. The async validation requires that the firstName is set to \"bill\".\r\nYou could see that the value of `isSubmitSuccessful` is immediately set to true even if an error is returned after 2 seconds.\r\n\r\n**Codesandbox link (Required)**\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-hook-form-handlesubmit-v6-forked-ve3lm\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe state value `isSubmitSuccessful` should be set to true only **after** the submit function has finished without errors.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- OS: Windows 10\r\n- Browser: Chrome\r\n- Version: 85\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"bluebill1049","id":10513364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTEzMzY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10513364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049","html_url":"https://github.com/bluebill1049","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluebill1049/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/react-hook-form/react-hook-form/issues/2859/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
