Async validation is very common in apps and if there's async, there's a risk of race conditions. Even if we are using Rxjs with debounce and switchmap, react-hook-form will not ignore previous validations, they will just resolve at a later date with latest value. I don't think this is ideal. To make it work we'd have to write a custom resolver which is IMO too much work for a common use case like this.\r\nHere's an example of what i mean.\r\n\r\nLet's say i have a debounce switchmap rxjs validator for duplicate email. This is the way i would use it\r\n```\r\n// validator\r\nconst validateDuplicate$ = new Subject();\r\nconst emailIsValid$ = validateDuplicate$.pipe(\r\n  debounceTime(250),\r\n  switchMap((email) => fetchIsDuplicate(email)),\r\n);\r\n// textfield\r\n<TextField {..register('email', { validate: async (email) => { \r\n  validateDuplicate$.next(email)\r\n  const isValid = await firstValueFrom(emailIsValid$)\r\n  return isValid || \"Email is duplicate\"\r\n}}}/>\r\n```\r\nLet's assume the debounceTime is 250ms\r\nWhen the user types and waits 250 ms, the request will be sent.\r\nThe user then starts typing again, so the validator will ignore that request and will wait 250ms after the user stops typing and send another request.\r\n\r\nThis works, but the problem i see with it is that formState.isValidating will updated multiple times as user types as well as errors object. Granted, it will be updated with the same latest validation value, but it might create some unexpected behavior and bugs.\r\n\r\nIf you see a better solution to my problem, please advise.\r\n\r\nI'd expect the library to handle this use case. Maybe adding a support for Observables can fix this issue, but I don't see why ignoring previous async validation could cause an issue or would be out of this library's
