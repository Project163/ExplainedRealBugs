                            <comment id="15390865" author="markhamstra" created="Sat, 23 Jul 2016 23:05:18 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The 2.1.0 release is the very earliest that we can allow removal of things first deprecated in 2.0.0.  That is different from saying that we &lt;b&gt;should&lt;/b&gt; remove those things in 2.1.0.  The decision as to exactly when we should and will remove things first deprecated in 2.0.0 needs more discussion. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15392484" author="shivaram" created="Mon, 25 Jul 2016 18:57:13 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Yeah lets hold off on this for now. For one, these functions aren&apos;t blocking other features (like say the CRAN checks). Also we should wait to hear from users if they prefer to use the deprecated function for some reason.  We can do a discussion on dev/user@spark say a month or so after 2.0 gets pushed out and then do this PR just before 2.1. &lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="15392517" author="markhamstra" created="Mon, 25 Jul 2016 19:05:12 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;As much as makes sense and is possible, we should also strive to coordinate removal of stuff deprecated in 2.0.0 of SparkR with removal of stuff deprecated elsewhere in Spark 2.0.0.  It&apos;s just easier for all parties concerned to be able to say that all the things were removed as of release x.y.z than to have Spark developers and users need to keep track that SparkR removed stuff in release x.y.a, Spark SQL removed stuff in x.y.b, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15392537" author="felixcheung" created="Mon, 25 Jul 2016 19:23:09 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Deprecated methods because of Spark JVM API changes are only a very small subset (actually, there&apos;s only 1: registerTempTable), agreed we should coordinate with JVM side if we could.&lt;br/&gt;
There are bigger changes to SparkR specific APIs (sqlContext parameter removal, sparkR.init) I think would be very good to clean up soon. They present changes to behavior they would become harder to maintain over time.&lt;br/&gt;
SparkR API has been &quot;experimental&quot; so I didn&apos;t think there would be a big problem, but we could certainly wait to get some feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15833206" author="felixcheung" created="Sun, 22 Jan 2017 00:46:14 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I want to bring this up again and potentially to discuss in dev@, now that we are on Spark 2.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only having these are harder to work with, making it harder to add new parameter (eg. numPartitions) and so on, but more importantly, the wrapper/stub methods (e.g createDataFrame.default) shows up in auto-complete, tooltips, help doc and so on and create confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, on a slightly orthogonal note, we should also consider removing all the internal RDD methods, or at least making them non-export S3 methods. Right now every time we are adding a new method having the same name of the existing, internal-only RDD method in R we would need to update the generic, and rename the existing method (by appending &quot;RDD&quot; to its name), and all its call sites, otherwise we would get a check-cran warning of lacking documentation. And by adding such method to the NAMESPACE file the existing RDD-only will get exposed as well (again showing up in auto-complete etc.), unless it is renamed. Since we are renaming the existing method to fix this, we are also breaking backward compatibility anyway (although the method was not public so strictly speaking there has not been any guarantee).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I could scope this JIRA to only sqlContext methods and leave this 2nd issue to a different JIRA.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

what do you think? &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I suppose we keep this till 2.4.0&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
