            <title>[SPARK-25543] Confusing log messages at DEBUG level, in K8s mode.</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25543</link>
                <project id="12315420" key="SPARK">Spark</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Steps to reproduce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start spark shell by providing a K8s master. Then turn the debug log on, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;
scala&amp;gt; sc.setLogLevel(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;DEBUG&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;
sc.setLogLevel(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;DEBUG&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)

scala&amp;gt; 2018-09-26 09:33:54 DEBUG ExecutorPodsLifecycleManager:58 - Removed executors with ids  from Spark that were either found to be deleted or non-existent in the cluster.

2018-09-26 09:34:04 DEBUG ExecutorPodsLifecycleManager:58 - Removed executors with ids  from Spark that were either found to be deleted or non-existent in the cluster.

2018-09-26 09:34:06 DEBUG ExecutorPodsLifecycleManager:58 - Removed executors with ids  from ...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fix is easy, first check if there are any removed executors, before producing the log message.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
