 This watermark lets the engine maintain intermediate state for additional 10 minutes to allow late
 data to be counted. For example, the data `(12:09, cat)` is out of order and late, and it falls in

 counts of the related windows. However, when the watermark is updated to `12:11`, the intermediate
