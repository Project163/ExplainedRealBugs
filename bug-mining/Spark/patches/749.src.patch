 read those text files directly if you want. Start with index.md.
 
 The markdown code can be compiled to HTML using the [Jekyll tool](http://jekyllrb.com).
-To use the `jekyll` command, you will need to have Jekyll installed. 
-The easiest way to do this is via a Ruby Gem, see the 
-[jekyll installation instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation).
-If not already installed, you need to install `kramdown` and `jekyll-redirect-from` Gems
-with `sudo gem install kramdown jekyll-redirect-from`.
-Execute `jekyll build` from the `docs/` directory. Compiling the site with Jekyll will create a directory
+`Jekyll` and a few dependencies must be installed for this to work. We recommend
+installing via the Ruby Gem dependency manager. Since the exact HTML output 
+varies between versions of Jekyll and its dependencies, we list specific versions here
+in some cases:
+
+    $ sudo gem install jekyll -v 1.4.3
+    $ sudo gem uninstall kramdown -v 1.4.1
+    $ sudo gem install jekyll-redirect-from
+
+Execute `jekyll` from the `docs/` directory. Compiling the site with Jekyll will create a directory
 called `_site` containing index.html as well as the rest of the compiled files.
 
 You can modify the default Jekyll build as follows:
