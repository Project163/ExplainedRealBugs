-# Building for PySpark on YARN

-PySpark on YARN is only supported if the jar is built with Maven. Further, there is a known problem
-with building this assembly jar on Red Hat based operating systems (see [SPARK-1753](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-1753)). If you wish to
-run PySpark on a YARN cluster with Red Hat installed, we recommend that you build the jar elsewhere,
-then ship it over to the cluster. We are investigating the exact cause for this.

 # Packaging without Hadoop Dependencies for YARN
 
 The assembly jar produced by `mvn package` will, by default, include all of Spark's dependencies, including Hadoop and some of its ecosystem projects. On YARN deployments, this causes multiple versions of these to appear on executor classpaths: the version packaged in the Spark assembly and the version on each node, included with `yarn.application.classpath`.  The `hadoop-provided` profile builds the assembly without including Hadoop-ecosystem projects, like ZooKeeper and Hadoop itself.

 The SBT build is derived from the Maven POM files, and so the same Maven profiles and variables
 can be set to control the SBT build. For example:
