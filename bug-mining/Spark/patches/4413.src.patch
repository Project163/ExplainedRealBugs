 is dropped only its metadata is removed.
 
+Starting from Spark 2.1, persistent datasource tables have per-partition metadata stored in the Hive metastore. This brings several benefits:
+
+- Since the metastore can return only necessary partitions for a query, discovering all the partitions on the first query to the table is no longer needed.
+- Hive DDLs such as `ALTER TABLE PARTITION ... SET LOCATION` are now available for tables created with the Datasource API.
+
+Note that partition information is not gathered by default when creating external datasource tables (those with a `path` option). To sync the partition information in the metastore, you can invoke `MSCK REPAIR TABLE`.
