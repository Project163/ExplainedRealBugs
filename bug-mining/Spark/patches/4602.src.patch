 The `Tokenizer.transform()` method splits the raw text documents into words, adding a new column with words to the `DataFrame`.
 The `HashingTF.transform()` method converts the words column into feature vectors, adding a new column with those vectors to the `DataFrame`.
 Now, since `LogisticRegression` is an `Estimator`, the `Pipeline` first calls `LogisticRegression.fit()` to produce a `LogisticRegressionModel`.
