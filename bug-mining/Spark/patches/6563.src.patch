   - Since Spark 3.0, substitution order of nested WITH clauses is changed and an inner CTE definition takes precedence over an outer. In version 2.4 and earlier, `WITH t AS (SELECT 1), t2 AS (WITH t AS (SELECT 2) SELECT * FROM t) SELECT * FROM t2` returns `1` while in version 3.0 it returns `2`. The previous behaviour can be restored by setting `spark.sql.legacy.ctePrecedence.enabled` to `true`.
 
-  - Since Spark 3.0, the `add_months` function does not adjust the resulting date to a last day of month if the original date is a last day of months. For example, `select add_months(DATE'2019-02-28', 1)` results `2019-03-28`. In Spark version 2.4 and earlier, the resulting date is adjusted when the original date is a last day of months. For example, adding a month to `2019-02-28` resultes in `2019-03-31`.

+  - Since Spark 3.0, 0-argument Java UDF is executed in the executor side identically with other UDFs. In Spark version 2.4 and earlier, 0-argument Java UDF alone was executed in the driver side, and the result was propagated to executors, which might be more performant in some cases but caused inconsistency with a correctness issue in some cases.
