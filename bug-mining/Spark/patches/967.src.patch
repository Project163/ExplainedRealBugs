 # Building With Hive and JDBC Support
 To enable Hive integration for Spark SQL along with its JDBC server and CLI,
 add the `-Phive` profile to your existing build options. By default Spark
 will build with Hive 0.13.1 bindings. You can also build for Hive 0.12.0 using
-the `-Phive-0.12.0` profile. NOTE: currently the JDBC server is only
-supported for Hive 0.12.0.
