 Different from many other R packages, to use SparkR, you need an additional installation of Apache Spark. The Spark installation will be used to run a backend process that will compile and execute SparkR programs.
 
-If you don't have Spark installed on the computer, you may download it from [Apache Spark Website](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html). Alternatively, we provide an easy-to-use function `install.spark` to complete this process. You don't have to call it explicitly. We will check the installation when `sparkR.session` is called and `install.spark` function will be  triggered automatically if no installation is found.
+After installing the SparkR package, you can call `sparkR.session` as explained in the previous section to start and it will check for the Spark installation. If you are working with SparkR from an interactive shell (eg. R, RStudio) then Spark is downloaded and cached automatically if it is not found. Alternatively, we provide an easy-to-use function `install.spark` for running this manually. If you don't have Spark installed on the computer, you may download it from [Apache Spark Website](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).
 
 ```{r, eval=FALSE}

-If you already have Spark installed, you don't have to install again and can pass the `sparkHome` argument to `sparkR.session` to let SparkR know where the Spark installation is.
