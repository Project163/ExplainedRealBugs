I see now. I think the issue is that coveralls plugin is an aggregate mojo and jacoco isn't. That causes an issue that coveralls and jacoco report file paths are not actually referring to same files. Good thing is that you can get this working, bad thing is that you need quite a lot of \"hard coded\" paths. So when you define `jacocoReports` configuration option, it is only visible to the root project and not to any submodule. Due to that fact all the paths must be relative to the root project so you actually need a custom path for every module and every jacoco report file.\n\n```\n<jacocoReports>\n  <jacocoReport>module1/target/site/jacoco-it/jacoco.xml</jacocoReport>\n  <jacocoReport>module1/target/site/jacoco-ut/jacoco.xml</jacocoReport>\n  ...\n</jacocoReports>\n```\n\nThis is far from optional solution, but I'm not sure if I can make this work out any reasonable way. All the paths are already expanded to full paths at runtime so I cannot even access the user defined variables to figure out that the user maybe wanted to use a module relative path. For cobertura I think this is not an issue because it can run in aggregate mode too and collect a report to the root project.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/comments/73384393/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trautonen","id":1641063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDEwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/comments/73384857","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/64#issuecomment-73384857","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/64","id":73384857,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMzg0ODU3","user":{"login":"ptahchiev","id":5320045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjAwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5320045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev","html_url":"https://github.com/ptahchiev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-07T21:49:46Z","updated_at":"2015-02-07T21:49:46Z","body":"I guess I'm stuck -

I can introduce a new configuration property `relativeReportDirs` where you can add module relative directories where to look the coverage report files. In your case it would be `/jacoco-it` and `/jacoco-ut`. The not so good thing is that I might shoot in the leg if there are new coverage tools introduced which report file names collide. But let's figure out a new solution then. And also the relative dirs rely on some magic dirs, which are the module's build and reporting output dirs, to look up the coverage reports.\n\n@paranoiabla do you think this is a reasonable solution and can you see any problems with it in your config or any other config?

Maybe I could do stateful source aggregation so that I keep track of the covered sources but this would require quite a lot of rewriting the plugin and also kill the streaming it has currently. For large code bases it would be quite hard to manage this with reasonable memory consumption.\n\nSo at the moment, not supported.

supported.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/comments/134377587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trautonen","id":1641063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDEwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":391032500,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzkxMDMyNTAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/events/391032500","actor":{"login":"ptahchiev","id":5320045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjAwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5320045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev","html_url":"https://github.com/ptahchiev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-08-24T20:56:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":391032501,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5MTAzMjUwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/events/391032501","actor":{"login":"ptahchiev","id":5320045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjAwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5320045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev","html_url":"https://github.com/ptahchiev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptahchiev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-08-24T20:56:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/comments/144169099","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/64#issuecomment-144169099","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/64","id":144169099,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDE2OTA5OQ==","user":{"login":"stevendlander","id":3169732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjk3MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3169732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander","html_url":"https://github.com/stevendlander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlan

I had a similar issue that I tracked down finally.  For my project, this error occurred when a class file got moved to a different folder, yet the package name was not updated to reflect that change.\n\nIn other words, one of my developers moved a class (Memoize2.java) one directory above it in the folder hierarchy but did _not_ update the package name.  I think the coveralls plugin was looking for the source where the package name specified and could not find it.\n\nHope this helps someone!\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/comments/144169099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stevendlander","id":3169732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjk3MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3169732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander","html_url":"https://github.com/stevendlander","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stevendlander/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":422310577,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDIyMzEwNTc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/events/422310577","actor":{"login":"trautonen","id":1641063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDEwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-29T19:49:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
