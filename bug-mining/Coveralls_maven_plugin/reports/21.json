I have a multi-module project setup like this:\n\n```\nparent (no tests, no coverage)\n    |---- module1 (tests and coverage reports)\n    |---- module2 (no tests no coverage reports)\n    |---- module 3 (tests and coverage reports)\n```\n\nSo what I do is I run maven from the parent project to run all my unit and integration tests and some of the modules produce results. Then after build is complete and jacoco has produced reports in some of the modules, I run maven again like this:\n\n```\nmvn coveralls:report\n```\n\nagain from the parent project. However the build fails with the following error:\n\n```\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.eluder.coveralls:coveralls-maven-plugin:3.0.1:report (default-cli) on project platform: I/O operation failed: No coverage report files found -> [Help 1]\n```\n\nThis happens because the parent has no tests  and no coverage reports. How can I can have the coveralls-maven-plugin aggregate all the reports from my modules and send it to coveralls?\n\nThank you \n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/64/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/64/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
