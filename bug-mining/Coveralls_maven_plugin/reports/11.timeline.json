So if you want to create a single coveralls report for your multimodule project, use Cobertura instead. There are some hacks that allow creating aggregate reports, but I think it's not worth the trouble.\n\nTo enable cobertura and report aggregation, add the following to your parent module's pom:\n\n``` xml\n      <plugin>\n        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>\n        <artifactId>cobertura-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n        <version>2.5.2</version>\n        <configuration>\n          <format>xml</format>\n          <maxmem>256m</maxmem>\n          <aggregate>true</aggregate>\n        </configuration>\n      </plugin>\n      <plugin>\n        <groupId>org.eluder.coveralls</groupId>\n        <artifactId>coveralls-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n        <version>2.0.0</version>\n      </plugin>\n```\n\nIf you are not using Travis CI, remember to provide repository token for the coveralls maven plugin, with Travis CI you can omit the token.\n\nAnd to create the aggregate report, then run in the parent module:\n\n```\nmvn clean cobertura:cobertura coveralls:cobertura\n```\n\nYou can test how the report generation goes by supplying `-DdryRun=true` parameter for the maven command.\n\nAnd for Travis CI, add the following to your `travis.yml`:\n\n```\nafter_success:\n  - mvn clean cobertura:cobertura coveralls:cobertura\n```\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/comments/22752449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trautonen","id":1641063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDEwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/comments/22802551","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/15#issuecomment-22802551","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/15","id":22802551,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODAyNTUx","user":{"login":"louiszuckerman","id":1179099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/louiszuckerman","html_url":"https://github.com/louiszuckerman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louiszuckerman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louiszuckerman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louiszuckerman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louiszuckerman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louiszuckerman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louiszuckerman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louiszuckerman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louiszuckerman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/louiszuckerman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-17T00:55:11Z","updated_at":"2013-08-17T00:55:11Z","body":"Thank you for the quick response.

I just forked your repo, made it Travis and Coveralls enabled and did few tests. First i ran with your current config and got the same peer not authenticated error which is caused by issuing an SSL connection without a trusted certificate in keystore.\n\nAfter that i changed Travis to use oraclejdk7 but got a failing test in `GlusterFileSystemProviderTest.java`. Not sure if this was due to change of the JDK, but I just ignored it to get along. After ignoring the test the coverage report was submitted right.\n\nThis issue is unfortunate, because the certificate mismatch will not allow any openjdk7 users in Travis to submit coverage reports to Coveralls. You could try to use Oracle JDKs keystore somehow when running the build or add the Coveralls certificate to Travis env keystore in before install phase. Or I could roll a version of the plugin that ignores the certificate validity, but I would not want to do this because it is a security risk and could allow a man in the middle attack.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/comments/22822094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trautonen","id":1641063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDEwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/comments/22896302","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/15#issuecomment-22896302","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/15","id":22896302,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODk2MzAy","user":{"login":"trautonen","id":1641063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDEwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-19T19:05:20Z","updated_at":"2013-08-19T19:05:20Z","body":"I've contacted to Travis and Coveralls about this issue.

there,\nI have the following project:\n- parent\n  - module1\n  - module2\n  - module3\n\nand I have configured the maven surefire AND failsafe plugins to produce results in each of the module's target folder. So to run the build I run the following in the parent folder:\n\n> mvn clean install coveralls:report -Ptest \n\nwhich cleans (with success), builds(with success), executes tests(with success), generates jacoco reports(with success) in each module and then it starts executing the coveralls:report but it fails because parent has no source, no tests and hence no jacoco.xml so the coveralls plugin complains with the following:\n\n[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.eluder.coveralls:coveralls-maven-plugin:3.0.1:report (default-cli) on project platform: I/O operation failed: No coverage report files found -> [Help 1]\n\nhere's the stacktrace:\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: No coverage report files found\n    at org.eluder.coveralls.maven.plugin.util.CoverageParsersFactory.createParsers(CoverageParsersFactory.java:101)\n    at org.eluder.coveralls.maven.plugin.CoverallsReportMojo.createCoverageParsers(CoverallsReportMojo.java:231)\n    at org.eluder.coveralls.maven.plugin.CoverallsReportMojo.execute(CoverallsReportMojo.java:196)\n\nI'd like to have an attribute like 'failOnError' maybe which can be set to true or false. This way if jacoco.xml was not found the build will continue to the next modules instead of failing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/61/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/61/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":755487437,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDc1NTQ4NzQzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/events/755487437","actor":{"login":"konohiroaki","id":11331801,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzMxODAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11331801?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/konohiroaki","html_url":"https://github.com/konohiroaki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konohiroaki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konohiroaki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konohiroaki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konohiroaki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konohiroaki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konohiroaki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konohiroaki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konohiroaki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/konohiroaki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ec0d0043f1c70bedee8699b2459f7c07c20e4012","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/konohiroaki/deep-initializer/commits/ec0d0043f1c70bedee8699b2459f7c07c20e4012","created_at":"2016-08-15T10:11:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
