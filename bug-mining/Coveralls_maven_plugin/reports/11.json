My two submodules are packaged as jar and as such have jacoco reports.  My parent module is packaged as pom though, so it does not have a jacoco report.  The maven coveralls plugin fails because it can not find the jacoco report for the parent project.  Please advise.\n\nIf there is a better place to seek support for this issue please let me know.\n\nThank you very much,\n\n-louis\n","closed_by":{"login":"trautonen","id":1641063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDEwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
