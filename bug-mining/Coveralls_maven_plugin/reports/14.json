@trautonen,\n\nFor a long time reports for handlebars.java were wrong and now it simply doesn't work.\n\nI opened a ticket at: https://github.com/lemurheavy/coveralls-public/issues/205 but it seems coveralls is OK and they suggested to check with you :)\n\nI made this change: https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java/commit/9cd383faa0449ef5087b766abed8940515942aa5 to see if that help, but it doesn't.\n\nCan you help me?\n\nThanks\n","closed_by":{"login":"trautonen","id":1641063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDEwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/28/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/28/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
