I've been puzzled with the issue you have had for a long time, but after some debug, try and error scenarios I found the reason. The problem is related to the Cobertura's DTD and how STAX implementations parse it. I have no idea why it fails, might be an issue with Cobertura or might be an issue in STAX or in the implementations. I even even tested with Xerces and Woodstox, no difference. I tried some STAX input factory parameters and found a combination that parses the XML correctly.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/comments/33917218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trautonen","id":1641063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDEwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":90233092,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDkwMjMzMDky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/events/90233092","actor":{"login":"trautonen","id":1641063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDEwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9adf868ca72912d54d75675f41bacffcf7b4810f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/commits/9adf868ca72912d54d75675f41bacffcf7b4810f","created_at":"2014-02-02T23:48:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/comments/33917532","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/28#issuecomment-33917532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/28","id":33917532,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTE3NTMy","user":{"login":"trautonen","id":1641063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDEwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-02T23:57:34Z","updated_at":"2014-02-02T23:57:52Z","body":"The reason why the reports are not submitted at all is due to [dryRun](https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java/blob/master/.travis.yml#L6) property in your configuration.
