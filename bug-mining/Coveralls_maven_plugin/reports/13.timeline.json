In my opinion there is no reason to test generated sources, because it is more likely the source generator which you want to test, not what it generates. And assuming we are using a third party library, it's not your job to test it along with your project.\n\nSee https://github.com/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/blob/master/pom.xml#L247 as one solution for this problem. It just tells cobertura to ignore the generated source file. I think you could use also the plugin's explicit source directories definition and add also the generated sources dir, but as your project is multi-module project, you'd need to define the submobule source directories too and everything becomes cumbersome.\n\nDo you think this is acceptable solution or should some extra effort be put on finding a better solution for handling generated sources?\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/comments/28515290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"trautonen","id":1641063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDEwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1641063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trautonen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/comments/28515648","html_url":"https://github.com/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/22#issuecomment-28515648","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trautonen/coveralls-maven-plugin/issues/22","id":28515648,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTE1NjQ4","user":{"login":"vertti","id":557751,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Nzc1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557751?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertti","html_url":"https://github.com/vertti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vertti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-14T19:41:16Z","updated_at":"2013-11-14T19:41:16Z","body":"Definitely no point in measuring coverages for generated stuff so your suggested solutions is both fine for me and probably the correct way too.
