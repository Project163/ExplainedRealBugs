there,\n\nI was using coveralls-maven-plugin and it has been a great plugin. I try to integrate with travis ci. My project is maven based and while travis builds successfully and then execute \"after-success\" procedure, I got the following failure, which seems to have some problems when delivering report via converalls API to its platform. I tried a few times but failure still shows, I suppose it was a stable reproduced issue. So could you please help me figure out?
