It currently relies on `project.build.sourceEncoding` unless the plugin's `<configuration>` section contains `sourceEncoding` property. It is good practice to define `project.build.sourceEncoding` for all maven projects anyway. See http://maven.apache.org/general.html#encoding-warning for more information.\n\nI never thought this could actually be undefined and at least I should throw more informative exception on how to fix
