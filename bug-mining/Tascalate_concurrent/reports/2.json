Then, it is added to the `failure` as a suppressed exception. However, it can happen that `failure` == `e` (is the same object) since `failure` is retrown when its type already is the `CompletionException`.\r\n\r\nI added a test for this in #8.\r\n\r\nWhat about calling the `forwardException` after the `try-catch` block as in the following code? This also make the code a little bit cleaner since there is only one call to `forward...` now :)\r\n ```\r\n// exceptions are handled in regular way\r\nfailure -> {\r\n    try {\r\n        action.accept(null, failure);\r\n    } catch (Throwable e) {\r\n        // CompletableFuture does not override exception here\r\n        // unlike as in handle[Async](BiFunction)\r\n        // Preserve this behavior, but let us add at least \r\n        // suppressed exception\r\n        failure.addSuppressed(e);\r\n    }\r\n    return forwardException(failure);\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"vsilaev","id":3337603,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzc2MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3337603?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsilaev","html_url":"https://github.com/vsilaev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsilaev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsilaev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsilaev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsilaev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsilaev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsilaev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsilaev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsilaev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsilaev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vsilaev/tascalate-concurrent/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vsilaev/tascalate-concurrent/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
