There is no way to find what that output Path is without duplicating the logic. `writeTo(Path)` should return the actual output `Path` so we don't have to. `writeTo(File)` should return a `File`.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to change the method signature, please consider adding a comment to these methods that the signature should change in 2.x and add a separate method to return the output path taking a Path parameter.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/javapoet/issues/691/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/javapoet/issues/691/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
