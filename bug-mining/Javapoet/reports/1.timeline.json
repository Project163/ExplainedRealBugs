([#&#8203;3803](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3803)). Using Error Prone to compile code that is deployed to earlier versions is still fully supported, but will require using JDK 17 or newer for compilation and setting `--release` or `-source`/`-target`/`-bootclasspath`.\n\nChanges:\n\n-   Update protobuf version for CVE-2024-7254\n\nNew checks:\n\n-   [`ArrayRecordComponent`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/ArrayRecordComponent): Record components should not be arrays.\n\nFull changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.32.0...v2.33.0\n\n### [`v2.32.0`](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.32.0): Error Prone 2.32.0\n\nThe minimum support JDK version to run Error Prone is now JDK 17 ([#&#8203;3803](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3803)).\n\nUsing Error Prone to compile code that is deployed to earlier versions is still fully supported, but will requires using JDK 17 or newer for compilation and setting `--release` or `-source`/`-target`/`-bootclasspath`.\n\nFull changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.31.0...v2.32.0\n\n### [`v2.31.0`](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.31.0): Error Prone 2.31.0\n\nThis is the last planned minor release of Error Prone that will support running on JDK 11, see [#&#8203;3803](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3803). Using Error Prone to compile code that is deployed to earlier versions will continue to be fully supported, but will require using JDK 17 or newer for compilation and setting `--release` or `-source`/`-target`/`-bootclasspath`.\n\nChanges:\n\n-   Introduce [`@ThreadSafeTypeParameter`](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/blob/2656f48902f6723f3147caa117372309dbc6c15f/type_annotations/src/main/java/com/google/errorprone/annotations/ThreadSafeTypeParameter.java) with enforcement by [ThreadSafe](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/ThreadSafe)\n-   Improved support for latest JDK 24 EA builds\n-   Error Prone is now distributed as a Multi-Release jar ([#&#8203;3756](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3756))\n\nNew checks:\n\n-   [`AutoValueBoxedValues`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/AutoValueBoxedValues): AutoValue instances should not usually contain boxed types that are not Nullable. We recommend removing the unnecessary boxing.\n\nFull changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.30.0...v2.31.0\n\n### [`v2.30.0`](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.30.0): Error Prone 2.30.0\n\nNew checks:\n\n-   [`AutoValueBoxedValues`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/AutoValueBoxedValues): Detects unnecessary boxing in AutoValue classes.\n-   [`DefaultLocale`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/DefaultLocale): Detects implicit use of the JVM default locale, which can result in differing behaviour between JVM executions.\n-   [`UnnecessaryBreakInSwitch`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/UnnecessaryBreakInSwitch): Remove unnecessary `break` statements in `->` switches.\n\nClosed issues: [#&#8203;632](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/632), [#&#8203;4487](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4487)\n\nFull changelog:

fix for a crash in `TraditionalSwitchExpression` ([https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4479](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4479))\n-   restores the `module-info` for the annotations jar, which was accidentally removed ([https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4480](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4480))\n\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.29.1...v2.29.2\n\n### [`v2.29.1`](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.29.1): Error Prone 2.29.1\n\nThis release contains all of the changes in [2.29.0](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.29.0), plus:\n\n-   a bug fix to `UnusedVariable` to handle unnamed `_` variables

[`v2.28.0`](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.28.0): Error Prone 2.28.0\n\nError Prone nows supports the latest JDK 23 EA builds ([#&#8203;4412](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4412), [#&#8203;4415](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4415)).\n\nClosed issues:\n\n-   Improved errors for invalid check severities ([#&#8203;4306](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4306)).\n-   Fix a crash with nested `instanceof` patterns ([#&#8203;4349](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4349)).\n-   Fix a crash in JUnitIncompatibleType ([#&#8203;4377](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4377)).\n-   In ObjectEqualsForPrimitives, don't suggest replacing `equal` with `==` for floating-point values ([#&#8203;4392](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4392)).\n\nNew checks:\n\n-   [`DeeplyNested`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/DeeplyNested) discourages very deeply nested code that can cause StackOverflowErrors during compilation.\n-   [`GuiceNestedCombine`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/GuiceNestedCombine) discourages nesting of `Modules.combine()`, which is unnecessary.\n-   [`PatternMatchingInstanceof`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/PatternMatchingInstanceof) migrates code to use [pattern matching for `instanceof`](https://openjdk.org/jeps/394)\n-   [`SunApi`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/SunApi) discourages use of internal proprietary JDK APIs which may be removed from future releases.\n\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.27.1...v2.28.0\n\n### [`v2.27.1`](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.27.1): Error Prone 2.27.1\n\nThis release contains all

[`VoidUsed`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/VoidUsed) suggests using a literal `null` instead of referring to a `Void`-typed variable.\n\nModified checks:\n\n-   `TruthSelfEquals` has been renamed

Modularized libraries depending on Error Prone annotations `2.26.x` and newer may see errors like:\n\n    error: package com.google.errorprone.annotations is not visible\n    import com.google.errorprone.annotations.CheckReturnValue;\n                                ^\n      (package com.google.errorprone.annotations is declared in module com.google.errorprone.annotations, but module ... does not read it)\n\nThe fix is to add `requires static` to the module declaration of modularized libraries that depend on Error Prone annotations:\n\n```diff\n module your.module {\n...\n+  requires static com.google.errorprone.annotations;\n }\n```\n\n***\n\nFull Changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.26.0...v2.26.1\n\n### [`v2.26.0`](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.0): Error Prone 2.26.0\n\n**Warning: This release contains a bug, please use [2.26.1](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.26.1) or newer instead.**\n\nChanges:\n\n-   The 'annotations' artifact now includes a `module-info.java` for Java Platform Module System support, thanks to [@&#8203;sgammon](https://redirect.github.com/sgammon) in [#&#8203;4311](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4311).\n-   Disabled checks passed to `-XepPatchChecks` are now ignored, instead of causing a crash.
