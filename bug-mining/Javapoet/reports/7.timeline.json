most cases, it is not required, but in `FieldSpec` etc., it's required to represent the above form of type names. If we write `Outer.Inner<String>` which can be represented with the current API, it will be a compilation-error, since `Outer` is already a raw type.\n\nPlease add a means to represent such type names in JavaPoet.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/javapoet/issues/479/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/javapoet/issues/479/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18048599660,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAHl9h84I5YvVzwAAAAQzx8Zs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/javapoet/issues/events/18048599660","actor":{"login":"nidhiyanandh","id":2841316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NDEzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2841316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidhiyanandh","html_url":"https://github.com/nidhiyanandh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidhiyanandh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidhiyanandh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidhiyanandh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidhiyanandh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidhiyanandh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidhiyanandh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidhiyanandh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidhiyanandh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nidhiyanandh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"186ccd85c9e448195b9a2a88bf272041dd5f41bb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nidhiyanandh/javapoet/commits/186ccd85c9e448195b9a2a88bf272041dd5f41bb","created_at":"2025-06-09T04:22:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
