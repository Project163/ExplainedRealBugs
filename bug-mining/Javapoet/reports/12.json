From JLS §[9.7.4](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.7.4):\r\n\r\n> Type annotations can apply to an array type or any component type thereof (§10.1). For example, assuming that `A`, `B`, and `C` are annotation types meta-annotated with `@Target(ElementType.TYPE_USE)`, then given the field declaration:\r\n>\r\n> ```java\r\n>@C int @A [] @B [] f;\r\n>```\r\n> `@A` applies to the array type `int[][]`, `@B` applies to its component type `int[]`, and `@C` applies to the element type int. For more examples, see §[10.2](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-10.html#jls-10.2).\r\n\r\nIn its current state javapoet lacks the expressivity regarding Java 8 `TYPE_USE` annotations and  makes the current usage `arraytype.annotated(typeAnnotation)` confusing. The annotation will be emitted preceding the type and hence applies to the component not to the array type.\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to #431.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rluble","id":4175508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzU1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4175508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rluble","html_url":"https://github.com/rluble","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rluble/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rluble/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rluble/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rluble/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rluble/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rluble/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rluble/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rluble/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rluble/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/javapoet/issues/614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/javapoet/issues/614/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
