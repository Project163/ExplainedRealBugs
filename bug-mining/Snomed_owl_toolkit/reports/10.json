Attributes which were recorded as in group 0 in the stated relationships and marked as grouped in the MRCM will be represented as self grouped in the OWL axioms. This self grouping will also be reflected in the inferred form so many relationships which were in group 0 will now move to another role group number, one which is not yet used in that concept in the inferred form.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe problem is that when the complete set of OWL axioms are classified those self grouped inferred relationship records should be updated, changing group 0 to a new role group number. However the OWL toolkit is instead making the relationships inactive and creating new relationships.","closed_by":{"login":"kaicode","id":2010517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTA1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2010517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IHTSDO/snomed-owl-toolkit/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IHTSDO/snomed-owl-toolkit/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
