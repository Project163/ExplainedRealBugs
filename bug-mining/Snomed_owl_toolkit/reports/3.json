the current International Edition authoring cycle (July 2018) the attributes which take part in property chains also have transitive behaviour. This is masking the fact that the current normal form calculation uses transitive properties but does not use property chains for transitive reduction. \r\nThe normal form calculation should use property chains. Properties with the transitive behaviour should be considered as a property chain involving just that property.","closed_by":{"login":"kaicode","id":2010517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTA1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2010517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode","html_url":"https://github.com/kaicode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaicode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IHTSDO/snomed-owl-toolkit/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/IHTSDO/snomed-owl-toolkit/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
