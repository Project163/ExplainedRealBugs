Many of our AsyncThunks are now errors, where in 1.5 the correct return type was inferred.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we use a factory to bind the state and some other types into `createAsyncThunk` and we define a default condition check. One of the points of this is that it gives us the types of of `State` and `Extra` in our AsyncThunks without having to define any generic params. We instead only have to have a stable return type and define the `ThunkArg`. E.g.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const fetchFoo = createAsyncThunk(\r\n  'foo',\r\n  async ({ id, optionalProp = 'defaultProp' }: { id: string, optionalProp?: string }, { dispatch, extra: { http } }) => {\r\n    const data = await dispatch(http.get<SomeReturn>('/foo', {id, optionalProp}))\r\n\r\n    return data\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nIn this example, the return type is hinted to `http` generic. `http` and `dispatch` are fully typed because this `createAsyncThunk` is created from a factory w/ the types for those bound to our defaults. And `ThunkArg` is obviously typed as you'd expect. This means that in calling `const a = await dispatch(fetchFoo({id: 'a'})).then(unwrapResult)`, `a` is `SomeReturn` and the `ThunkArg` is type checked.\r\n\r\nI'm seeing a bunch of issues with return types in 1.6 when nothing in our code has changed. For example, union types are failing and it's showing the same sorts of errors as OP. Anything like:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nenum AorBProp {\r\n  A = 'A',\r\n  B = 'B',\r\n}\r\ntype A = { prop: AorBProp.A }\r\ntype B = { prop: AorBProp.B }\r\ntype AorB = A | B\r\n```\r\nResults in the error:\r\n```\r\nType 'Promise<AorB>' is not assignable to type 'Promise<RejectWithValue<unknown, unknown> | A>'.\r\n  Type 'AorB' is not assignable to type 'RejectWithValue<unknown, unknown> | A'.\r\n    Type 'B' is not assignable to type 'RejectWithValue<unknown, unknown> | A'.\r\n      Type 'B' is not assignable to type 'A'.\r\n        Types of property 'prop' are incompatible.\r\n          Type 'AorBProp.B' is not assignable to type 'AorBProp.A'.\r\n```\r\nIn this case, even giving the return type explicitly does nothing to fix the situation.\r\n\r\nI'm happy with some of the improvements in 1.6, but this sort of breaking change should not have made it into a feature release.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/comments/907501255/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bfricka","id":689311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/689311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka","html_url":"https://github.com/bfricka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/comments/907517508","html_url":"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/1156#issuecomment-907517508","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/1156","id":907517508,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB2ACAs42F55E","user":{"login":"bfricka","id":689311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/689311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka","html_url":"https://github.com/bfricka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-27T23:04:03Z","updated_at":"2021-08-27T23:04:19Z","body":"Here's a follow up repro:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nenum Foo {\r\n  A = 'A',\r\n  B = 'B',\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype A = { prop: Foo.A }\r\ntype B = { prop: Foo.B }\r\ntype AorB = A | B\r\n\r\n// Error\r\nconst a = createAsyncThunk('foo', () => Promise.resolve<AorB>({ prop: Foo.A }))\r\n```\r\nAlso note that `rejectWithValue` type can only be defined through generics and can't be inferred.

itself has breaking changes to all users of TypeScript in every minor version, similarly we also sometimes cannot avoid them on type level.  \r\nWe are trying our best, but even though we have a full suite of type tests running against the last 5 versions of TS, things slip through.  \r\nAlso, you might have noticed that we only do releases every few months, so if things slip through it might take some time to get back to it.  \r\nWe are few people and doing this in our free time and there is much more to this project than just writing code - there is a lot of community work involved as well that is just as important.  \r\nGiven that we are such a small team, real life *has* to have priority for us, as an Open Source project of this size otherwise can easily burn out the contributors. There have been enough examples of that over the last few years, so please keep that in mind and please in general keep in mind what message you are sending.

While there are still some type issues I'll need to work through with the new `rejectWithValue` types, the enum + union issues are fixed by that conditional voodoo.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/comments/908640621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bfricka","id":689311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4OTMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/689311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka","html_url":"https://github.com/bfricka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bfricka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/comments/908745443","html_url":"https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/1156#issuecomment-908745443","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/1156","id":908745443,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB2ACAs42Klrj","user":{"login":"phryneas","id":4282439,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI0Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4282439?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas","html_url":"https://github.com/phryneas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phryneas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-30T22:22:59Z","updated_at":"2021-08-30T22:22:59Z","body":"As I said - best install the CodeSandbox build - the link above has install instructions, it's really just `npm install <someUrl>`.
