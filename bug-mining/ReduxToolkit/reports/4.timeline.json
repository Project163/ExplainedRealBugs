the example works compiles fine in TypeScript 3.2.2 (the one we test against within redux-starter-kit), and the overall action type of the slice is inferred as `PayloadAction<any>`. However, in TypeScript 3.4 compilation fails as subscribed.\r\n\r\nI suspect the change in behavior stems from a [change in 3.4](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html):\r\n\r\n> __Higher order type inference from generic functions__\r\n>\r\n> TypeScript 3.4 can now produce generic function types when inference from other generic functions produces free type variables for inferences. This means many function composition patterns now work better in 3.4.\r\n\r\nSounds related, but I'm not 100% sure.\r\n\r\nAnyway, a pragmatic solution would be to change the type signature of `createSlice` to expect `PayloadAction<any>` everywhere.
