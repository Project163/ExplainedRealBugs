Does it work if you change it like this?\r\n```diff\r\n- export type AppThunk = ThunkAction<void, RootState, null, Action<string>>;\r\n+ export type AppThunk = ThunkAction<void, RootState, undefined, Action<string>>;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe I may have found the root cause for this:\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, we get Dispatch from the middleware via\r\n```ts\r\nM extends Middleware<infer DispatchExt, any, any>\r\n  ? DispatchExt extends Function\r\n    ? DispatchExt\r\n  : never\r\n: never\r\n```\r\n\r\nand our Middleware is per default\r\n\r\n`ThunkMiddleware<S>`. After some resolving, all these are equal:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype DefaultMiddleware<S> = ThunkMiddleware<S>\r\ntype DefaultMiddleware<S> = ThunkMiddleware<S, AnyAction, undefined, ThunkDispatch<S, undefined, AnyAction>>\r\ntype DefaultMiddleware<S> = Middleware<ThunkDispatch<S, undefined, AnyAction>, S, <ThunkDispatch<S, undefined, AnyAction>\r\n```\r\nSo we'd extract a Dispatch type of `ThunkDispatch<S, undefined, AnyAction>` from this.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack in 1.2.1, the Dispatch type was `ThunkDispatch<S, any, AnyAction>` which would not conflict with the new Dispatch type, but was a little more loose.\r\nUnfortunately, [the advanced tutorial](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/advanced-tutorial/#adding-a-reusable-thunk-function-type) recommends adding `type AppThunk = ThunkAction<void, RootState, null, Action<string>>` which would have been compatible with the old, more loose definition, but not with the new definition that is more strict, but more in line with the redux-thunk default behavior.\r\n\r\nLet's see if my fix above would fix it for @belgattitude - as a result, I might have to specify the ThunkMiddleware to be a `ThunkMiddleware<S, AnyAction, any, ThunkDispatch<S, any, AnyAction>>`. Or we change the tutorial and try to communicate the breakage there. Would be cleaner, but more of a hassle for users.
