the intermediate tutorial you showcase a really common pattern of importing an action creator from a slice and then map it to props using connect().  I'm struggling to decide what the right way to handle this is.  Since redux-toolkit seems to have some strong opinions I was hoping for one about this topic.\r\n\r\nThere's a great answer on SO about this same topic ( https://stackoverflow.com/a/42337137 ).\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards his #1 solution of just disabling this eslint rule in my project.  His #3 violates react/destructuring-assignment eslint rule. \r\n\r\nOnly other option imo is #2 where you rename the connected action creator with some strict naming convention but that just doesn't feel great to me either.\r\n\r\nWhat do the folks here recommend?  Based on the tutorial it seems you would also lean towards just allowing variable shadowing in this case?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"renovate[bot]","id":29139614,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjkxMzk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/2740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/renovate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/renovate%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-17T18:32:13Z","updated_at":"2023-02-17T18:32:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ZacharyDonnelly/BestPass/issues/10","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ZacharyDonnelly/BestPass","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ZacharyDonnelly/BestPass/issues/10/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ZacharyDonnelly/BestPass/issues/10/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ZacharyDonnelly/BestPass/issues/10/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ZacharyDonnelly/BestPass/pull/10","id":1283748064,"node_id":"PR_kwDOHhnb_846UCXc","number":10,"title":"fix(deps):

release** fixes a potential internal data leak in SSR environments, improves handling of headers in `fetchBaseQuery`, improves `retry` handling for unexpected errors and request aborts, and fixes a longstanding issue with `prefetch` leaving an unused subscription.  We've also shipped a new `graphqlRequestBaseQuery` release with updated dependencies and better error handling.\n\n#### Changelog\n\n##### Internal Subscription Handling\n\nWe had a report that a Redux SSR app had internal subscription data showing up across different requests.  After investigation, this was a bug introduced by the recent [RTKQ perf optimizations](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5064), where the internal subscription fields were hoisted outside of the middleware setup and into `createApi` itself.  This meant they existed outside of the per-store-instance lifecycle.  We've reworked the logic to ensure the data is per-store again.  We also fixed another issue that miscalculated when there was an active request while checking for cache entry cleanup.\n\nNote that no actual app data was leaked in this case, just the internal subscription IDs that RTKQ uses in its own middleware to track the existence of subscriptions per cache entry.\n\n##### `fetchBaseQuery` Headers\n\nWe've updated `fetchBaseQuery` to avoid setting `content-type` in cases where a non-JSONifiable value like `FormData` is being passed as the request body, so that the browser can set that content type itself.  It also now sets the `accept` header based on the selected `responseHandler` (JSON or text).\n\n##### `retry` Behavior and Cleanup\n\nThe `retry` util now respects the `maxRetries` option when catching unknown errors in addition to the existing known errors logic.  It also now checks the request's `AbortSignal` and will stop retrying if aborted.\n\nIn conjunction with that, dispatching `resetApiState` will now abort all in-flight requests.\n\nThe `prefetch` util and `usePrefetch` hook had a long-standing issue where they would create a subscription for a cache entry, but there was no way to clean up that subscription.  This meant that the cache entry was effectively permanent.  They now initiate the request without adding a subscription.  This will fetch the cache entry and leave it in the store for the `keepUnusedDataFor` period as intended, giving your app time to actually subscribe to the value (such as prefetching the cache entry in a route handler, and then subscribing in a component).\n\n##### `graphqlRequestBaseQuery`\n\nWe've published `@rtk-query/graphql-request-base-query` v2.3.2, which updates the `graphql-request` dep to ^7.  We also fixed an issue where the error handling rethrew unknown errors - it now returns `{error}` as a base query is supposed to.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- Fix potential subscription leakage in SSR environments by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;5111](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5111)\n- Improve `fetchBaseQuery` default headers handling by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;5112](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5112)\n- Respect maxRetries for unexpected errors by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;5113](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5113)\n- fix: update graphql-request dependency to include version ^7.0.0 by [@&#8203;eyesfocus](https://redirect.github.com/eyesfocus) in [#&#8203;4987](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4987)\n- Add `retry` abort handling and abort on `resetApiState` by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;5114](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5114)\n- Don't create subscriptions for prefetch calls by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;5116](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5116)\n\n**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.9.1...v2.9.2>\n\n### [`v2.9.1`](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.9.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.9.0...v2.9.1)\n\nThis **bugfix release** fixes how sorted entity adapters handle duplicate IDs, tweaks the TS types for RTKQ query state cache entries to improve how the `data` field is handled, and adds better cleanup for long-running listener middleware effects.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- fix(entityAdapter): ensure sorted addMany keeps first occurrence of duplicate ids by [@&#8203;demyanm](https://redirect.github.com/demyanm) in [#&#8203;5097](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5097)\n- fix(entityAdapter): ensure sorted setMany keeps just unique IDs in state.ids by [@&#8203;demyanm](https://redirect.github.com/demyanm) in [#&#8203;5107](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5107)\n- fix(types): ensure non-undefined `data` on isSuccess with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` by [@&#8203;CO0Ki3](https://redirect.github.com/CO0Ki3) in [#&#8203;5088](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5088)\n- Allow executing effects that have become unsubscribed to be canceled by `listenerMiddleware.clearListeners` by [@&#8203;chris-chambers](https://redirect.github.com/chris-chambers) in [#&#8203;5102](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5102)\n\n**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.9.0...v2.9.1>\n\n### [`v2.9.0`](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.9.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.8.2...v2.9.0)\n\nThis **feature release** rewrites RTK Query's internal subscription and polling systems and the `useStableQueryArgs` hook for better perf, adds automatic `AbortSignal` handling to requests still in progress when a cache entry is removed, fixes a bug with the `transformResponse` option for queries, adds a new `builder.addAsyncThunk` method, and fixes assorted other issues.\n\n#### Changelog\n\n##### RTK Query Performance Improvements\n\nWe had reports that [RTK Query could get very slow when there were thousands of subscriptions to the same cache entry](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/5052).  After investigation, we found that the internal polling logic was attempting to recalculate the minimum polling time after every new subscription was added.  This was highly inefficient, as most subscriptions don't change polling settings, and it required repeated O(n) iteration over the growing list of subscriptions.  We've rewritten that logic to debounce the update check and ensure a max of one polling value update per tick for the entire API instance.\n\nRelated, while working on the request abort changes, testing showed that use of plain `Record`s to hold subscription data was inefficient because we have to iterate keys to check size.  We've rewritten the subscription handling internals to use `Map`s instead, as well as restructuring some additional checks around in-flight requests.\n\nThese two improvements drastically improved runtime perf for the thousands-of-subscriptions-one-cache-entry repro, eliminating RTK methods as visible hotspots in the perf profiles.    It likely also improves perf for general usage as well.\n\nWe've also changed the implementation of our internal `useStableQueryArgs` hook to avoid calling `serializeQueryArgs` on its value, which can avoid potential perf issues when a query takes a very large object as its cache key.\n\n> \\[!NOTE]\n> The internal logic switched from serializing the query arg to doing reference checks on nested values.  This means that if you are passing a non-POJO value in a query arg, such as `useSomeQuery({a: new Set()})`, *and* you have `refetchOnMountOrArgChange` enabled, this will now trigger refeteches each time as the `Set` references are now considered different based on equality instead of serialization.\n\n##### Abort Signal Handling on Cleanup\n\nWe've had numerous requests over time for various forms of \"abort in-progress requests when the data is no longer needed / params change / component unmounts / some expensive request is taking too long\".  This is a complex topic with multiple potential use cases, and our standard answer has been that we *don't* want to abort those requests - after all, cache entries default to staying in memory for 1 minute after the last subscription is removed, so RTKQ's cache can still be updated when the request completes.  That also means that it doesn't make sense to abort a request \"on unmount\".\n\nHowever, it does then make sense to abort an in-progress request if the cache entry itself is removed.  Given that, we've updated our cache handling to automatically call the existing `resPromise.abort()` method in that case, triggering the `AbortSignal` attached to the `baseQuery`.  The handling at that point depends on your app - `fetchBaseQuery` should handle that, a custom `baseQuery` or `queryFn` would need to listen to the `AbortSignal`.\n\nWe do have [an open issue asking for further discussions of potential abort / cancelation use cases](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/2444) and would appreciate further feedback.\n\n##### New Options\n\nThe builder callback used in `createReducer` and `createSlice.extraReducers` now has `builder.addAsyncThunk` available, which allows handling specific actions from a thunk in the same way that you could define a thunk inside `createSlice.reducers`:\n\n```ts\n        const slice = createSlice({\n          name: 'counter',\n          initialState: {\n            loading: false,\n            errored: false,\n            value: 0,\n          },\n          reducers: {},\n          extraReducers: (builder) =>\n            builder.addAsyncThunk(asyncThunk, {\n              pending(state) {\n                state.loading = true\n              },\n              fulfilled(state, action) {\n                state.value = action.payload\n              },\n              rejected(state) {\n                state.errored = true\n              },\n              settled(state) {\n                state.loading = false\n              },\n            }),\n        })\n```\n\n`createApi` and individual endpoint definitions now accept a `skipSchemaValidation` option with an array of schema types to skip, or `true` to skip validation entirely (in case you want to use a schema for its types, but the actual validation is expensive).\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\nThe infinite query implementation accidentally changed the query internals to *always* run `transformResponse` if provided, including if you were using `upsertQueryData()`, which then broke.  It's been fixed to only run on an actual query request.\n\nThe internal changes to the structure of the `state.api.provided` structure broke our handling of `extractRehydrationInfo` - we've updated that to handle the changed structure.\n\nThe infinite query status fields like `hasNextPage` are now a looser type of `boolean` initially, rather than strictly `false`.\n\n##### TS Types\n\nWe now export Immer's `WritableDraft` type to fix another non-portable types issue.\n\nWe've added an `api.endpoints.myEndpoint.types.RawResultType` types-only field to match the other available fields.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- Add RawResultType as a type-only property on endpoints by [@&#8203;EskiMojo14](https://redirect.github.com/EskiMojo14) in [#&#8203;5037](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5037)\n- allow passing an array of specific schemas to skip by [@&#8203;EskiMojo14](https://redirect.github.com/EskiMojo14) in [#&#8203;5042](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5042)\n- fix(types): re-exporting WritableDraft from immer by [@&#8203;marinsokol5](https://redirect.github.com/marinsokol5) in [#&#8203;5015](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5015)\n- Remove Serialisation from useStableQueryArgs by [@&#8203;riqts](https://redirect.github.com/riqts) in [#&#8203;4996](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4996)\n- add addAsyncThunk method to reducer map builder by [@&#8203;EskiMojo14](https://redirect.github.com/EskiMojo14) in [#&#8203;5007](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5007)\n- Only run `transformResponse` when a `query` is used by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;5049](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5049)\n- Assorted bugfixes for 2.8.3 by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;5060](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5060)\n- Abort pending requests if the cache entry is removed by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;5061](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5061)\n- Update TS CI config by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;5065](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5065)\n- Rewrite subscription handling and polling calculations for better perf by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;5064](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/5064)\n\n**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.8.2...v2.9.0>\n\n### [`v2.8.2`](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.8.2)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.8.1...v2.8.2)\n\nThis **bugfix release** fixes a bundle size regression in RTK Query from the build and packaging changes in v2.8.0.\n\nIf you're using v2.8.0 or v2.8.1, please upgrade to v2.8.2 right away to resolve that bundle size issue!\n\n#### Changelog\n\n##### RTK Query Bundle Size\n\nIn v2.8.0, we reworked our packaging setup to better support React Native.  While there weren't many meaningful code changes, we did alter our bundling build config file.  In the process, we lost the config options to externalize the `@reduxjs/toolkit` core when building the RTK Query nested entry points.  This resulted in a regression where the RTK core code also got bundled directly into the RTK Query artifacts, resulting in a significant size increase.\n\nThis release fixes the build config and restores the previous RTKQ build artifact sizes.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- Restructure build config to fix RTKQ externals by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;4985](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4985)\n\n**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.8.1...v2.8.2>\n\n### [`v2.8.1`](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.8.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.8.0...v2.8.1)\n\nThis **bugfix release** makes an additional update to the package config to fix a regression that happened with Jest and `jest-environment-jsdom`.\n\n> \\[!CAUTION]\n> This release had a bundle size regression. Please update to [v2.8.2](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.8.2) to resolve that issue.\n\n#### Changes\n\n##### More Package Updates\n\nAfter releasing [v2.8.0](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.8.0), we got reports that [Jest tests were breaking](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/4971).  After investigation we concluded that `jest-environment-jsdom` was looking at the new `browser` package exports condition we'd added to better support JSPM, finding an ESM file containing the `export` keyword, and erroring because it doesn't support ES modules correctly.\n\n[#&#8203;4971 (comment)](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/4971#issuecomment-2859506562) listed several viable workarounds, but this is enough of an issue we wanted to fix it directly. We've tweaked the package exports setup again, and it appears to resolve the issue with Jest.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- fix: `browser` `exports` condition by [@&#8203;aryaemami59](https://redirect.github.com/aryaemami59) in [#&#8203;4973](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4973)\n\n**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.8.0...v2.8.1>\n\n### [`v2.8.0`](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.8.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.7.0...v2.8.0)\n\nThis **feature release** improves React Native compatibility by updating our package exports definitions, and adds `queryArg` as an additional parameter to infinite query page param functions.\n\n> \\[!CAUTION]\n> This release had a bundle size regression, as well as a breakage with `jest-environment-jsdom`. Please update to [v2.8.2](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.8.2) to resolve those issues.\n\n#### Changelog\n\n##### Package Exports and React Native Compatibility\n\nExpo and the Metro bundler have been adding improved support for the `exports` field in `package.json` files, but those changes started printing warnings due to how some of our package definitions were configured.\n\nWe've reworked the package definitions (*again*!), and this should be resolved now.\n\n##### Infinite Query Page Params\n\nThe signature for the `getNext/PreviousPageParam` functions has been:\n\n```ts\n(\n    lastPage: DataType,\n    allPages: Array<DataType>,\n    lastPageParam: PageParam,\n    allPageParams: Array<PageParam>,\n  ) => PageParam | undefined | null\n```\n\nThis came directly from React Query's API and implementation.\n\nWe've had some requests to make the endpoint's `queryArg` available in page param functions.  For React Query, that isn't necessary because the callbacks are defined inline when you call the `useInfiniteQuery` hook, so you've already got the query arg available in scope and can use it. Since RTK Query defines these callbacks as part of the endpoint definition, the query arg isn't in scope.\n\nWe've added `queryArg` as an additional 5th parameter to these functions in case it's needed.\n\n##### Other Changes\n\nWe've made a few assorted docs updates, including replacing the search implementation to now use a local index generated on build (which should be more reliable and also has a nicer results list uI), and fixing some long-standing minor docs issues.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- fix: React-Native package exports by [@&#8203;aryaemami59](https://redirect.github.com/aryaemami59) in [#&#8203;4887](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4887)\n- Add queryArg as 5th param to page param functions by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;4967](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4967)\n\n**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.7.0...v2.8.0>\n\n### [`v2.7.0`](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.7.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.6.1...v2.7.0)\n\nRTK has hit Stage 2.7! :rofl: This **feature release** adds support for Standard Schema validation in RTK Query endpoints, fixes several issues with infinite queries, improves perf when infinite queries provide tags, adds a dev-mode check for duplicate middleware, and improves reference stability in slice selectors and infinite query hooks.\n\n#### Changelog\n\n##### Standard Schema Validation for RTK Query\n\nApps often need to validate responses from the server, both to ensure the data is correct, and to help enforce that the data matches the expected TS types.  This is typically done with schema libraries such as Zod, Valibot, and Arktype.  Because of the similarities in usage APIs, those libraries and others now support a common API definition called [Standard Schema](https://standardschema.dev/), allowing you to plug your chosen validation library in anywhere Standard Schema is supported.\n\nRTK Query now supports using Standard Schema to validate query args, responses, and errors.  If schemas are provided, the validations will be run and errors thrown if the data is invalid.  Additionally, providing a schema allows TS inference for that type as well, allowing you to omit generic types from the endpoint.\n\nSchema usage is per-endpoint, and can look like this:\n\n```ts\nimport { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@&#8203;reduxjs/toolkit/query/react'\nimport * as v from 'valibot'\n\nconst postSchema = v.object({\n  id: v.number(),\n  name: v.string(),\n})\ntype Post = v.InferOutput<typeof postSchema>\n\nconst api = createApi({\n  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: '/' }),\n  endpoints: (build) => ({\n    getPost: build.query({\n      // infer arg from here\n      query: ({ id }: { id: number }) => `/post/${id}`,\n      // infer result from here\n      responseSchema: postSchema,\n    }),\n    getTransformedPost: build.query({\n      // infer arg from here\n      query: ({ id }: { id: number }) => `/post/${id}`,\n      // infer untransformed result from here\n      rawResponseSchema: postSchema,\n      // infer transformed result from here\n      transformResponse: (response) => ({\n        ...response,\n        published_at: new Date(response.published_at),\n      }),\n    }),\n  }),\n})\n```\n\nIf desired, you can also configure schema error handling with the `catchSchemaFailure` option.  You can also disable actual runtime validation with `skipSchemaValidation` (primarily useful for cases when payloads may be large and expensive to validate, but you still want to benefit from the TS type inference).\n\nSee the [\"Schema Validation\" docs section in the `createApi` reference](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/api/createApi#schema-validation) and the usage guide sections on [queries](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/queries#runtime-validation-using-schemas), infinite queries, and mutations, for more details.\n\n##### Infinite Query Fixes\n\nThis release fixes several reported issue with infinite queries:\n\n- The `lifecycleApi.updateCachedData` method is now correctly available\n- The `skip` option now correctly works for infinite query hooks\n- Infinite query `fulfilled` actions now include the `meta` field from the base query (such as `{request, response}`).  For cases where multiple pages are being refetched, this will be the meta from the last page fetched.\n- `useInfiniteQuerySubscription` now returns stable references for `refetch` and the `fetchNext/PreviousPage` methods\n\n##### `upsertQueryEntries`, Tags Performance and API State Structure\n\nWe recently published a fix to actually process per-endpoint `providedTags` when using `upsertQueryEntries`.  However, this exposed a performance issue - the internal tag handling logic was doing repeated O(n) iterations over *all* endpoint+tag entries in order to clear out existing references to that cache key.  In cases where hundreds or thousands of cache entries were being inserted, this became extremely expensive.\n\nWe've restructured the `state.api.provided` data structure to handle reverse-mapping between tags and cache keys, which drastically improves performance in this case.  However, it's worth noting that this *is* a change to that state structure.  This *shouldn't* affect apps, because the RTKQ state is intended to be treated as a black box and not generally directly accessed by user app code.  However, it's possible someone may have depended on that specific state structure when writing a custom selector, in which case this would break.  An actual example of this is the Redux DevTools RTKQ panel, which iterates the tags data while displaying cache entries.  That *did* break with this change.  Prior to releasing RTK 2.7,we released [Redux DevTools 3.2.10](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/releases/tag/remotedev-redux-devtools-extensions%403.2.10), which includes support for both the old and new `state.api.provided` definitions.\n\n##### TS Support Matrix Updates\n\nFollowing with the DefinitelyTyped support matrix, we've officially dropped support for TS 5.0, and currently support TS 5.1 - 5.8.  (RTK likely still works with 5.0, but we no longer test against that in CI.)\n\n##### Duplicate Middleware Dev Checks\n\n`configureStore` now checks the final middleware array for duplicate middleware references.  This will catch cases such as accidentally adding the same RTKQ API middleware twice (such as adding `baseApi.middleware` and `injectedApi.middlweware` - these are actually the same object and same middleware).\n\nUnlike the other dev-mode checks, this is part of `configureStore` itself, not `getDefaultMiddleware()`.\n\nThis can be configured via the new `duplicateMiddlewareCheck` option.\n\n##### Other Changes\n\n`createEntityAdapter` now correctly handles adding an item and then applying multiple updates to it.\n\nThe generated `combineSlices` selectors will now return the same placeholder initial state reference for a given slice, rather than returning a new initial state reference every time.\n\n`useQuery` hooks should now correctly refetch after dispatching `resetApiState`.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- Process multiple update for the same new entity by [@&#8203;demyanm](https://redirect.github.com/demyanm) in [#&#8203;4890](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4890)\n- add infinite query support for updateCachedData by [@&#8203;alexmotoc](https://redirect.github.com/alexmotoc) in [#&#8203;4905](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4905)\n- add infinite query skip support by [@&#8203;alexmotoc](https://redirect.github.com/alexmotoc) in [#&#8203;4906](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4906)\n- Cache initial state in injected scenarios by [@&#8203;EskiMojo14](https://redirect.github.com/EskiMojo14) in [#&#8203;4908](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4908)\n- Rewrite providedTags handling for better perf by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;4910](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4910)\n- Allow standard schemas to validate endpoint values by [@&#8203;EskiMojo14](https://redirect.github.com/EskiMojo14) in [#&#8203;4864](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4864)\n- fix(rtk-query): `useQuery` hook does not refetch after `resetApiState` by [@&#8203;juniusfree](https://redirect.github.com/juniusfree) in [#&#8203;4758](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4758)\n- Drop TS 5.0 from compat matrix by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;4925](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4925)\n- Add duplicate middleware dev check to configureStore by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;4927](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4927)\n- Improve duplicate middleware error and save build output by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;4928](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4928)\n- Add meta handling for infinite queries by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;4939](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4939)\n- improve stability of useInfiniteQuerySubscription's return value by [@&#8203;EskiMojo14](https://redirect.github.com/EskiMojo14) in [#&#8203;4937](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4937)\n- Add `catchSchemaFailure`, and docs for RTKQ schema features by [@&#8203;EskiMojo14](https://redirect.github.com/EskiMojo14) in [#&#8203;4934](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4934)\n\n**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.6.1...v2.7.0>\n\n### [`v2.6.1`](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.6.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.6.0...v2.6.1)\n\nThis **bugfix release** fixes several assorted types issues with the initial infinite query feature release, and adds support for an optional signal argument to `createAsyncThunk`.\n\n#### Changelog\n\n##### Infinite Query Fixes\n\nWe've fixed several types issues that were reported with infinite queries after the 2.6.0 release:\n\n- `matchFulfilled` and `providesTags` now get the correct response types\n- We've added pre-typed `Type*` types to represent infinite queries, similar to the existing pre-defined types for queries and mutations\n- `selectCachedArgsForQuery` now supports fetching args for infinite query endpoints\n- We fixed some TS type portability issues with infinite queries that caused errors when generating TS declarations\n- `useInfiniteQueryState/Subscription` now correctly expect just the query arg, not the combined `{queryArg, pageParam}` object\n\n##### Other Improvements\n\n`createAsyncThunk` now accepts an optional `{signal}` argument.

It's been [by far our most requested feature](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/discussions/1163).  Until recently, our answer was that [we felt there were too many use cases to support with a single API design approach](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/discussions/1163#discussioncomment-849158).\n\nLast year, we revisited this concept and concluded that the best approach was to mimic [the flexible infinite query API design from React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/infinite-queries).  We had additional discussions with [@&#8203;tkdodo](https://redirect.github.com/tkdodo) , who described the rationale and implementation approach and encouraged us to use their API design, and [@&#8203;riqts](https://redirect.github.com/riqts) provided an initial implementation on top of RTKQ's existing internals.\n\nWe're excited to announce that **this release officially adds full infinite query endpoint support to RTK Query!**\n\n##### Using Infinite Queries\n\nAs with React Query, the API design is based around \"page param\" values that act as the query arguments for fetching a specific page for the given cache entry.\n\nInfinite queries are defined with a new `build.infiniteQuery()` endpoint type.  It accepts all of the same options as normal query endpoints, but also needs an additional `infiniteQueryOptions` field that specifies the infinite query behaviors.    With TypeScript, you must supply 3 generic arguments: `build.infiniteQuery<ResultType, QueryArg, PageParam>`, where `ResultType` is the contents of a single page, `QueryArg` is the type passed in as the cache key, and `PageParam` is the value used to request a specific page.\n\nThe endpoint must define an `initialPageParam` value that will be used as the default (and can be overridden if desired).  It also needs a `getNextPageParam` callback that will calculate the params for each page based on the existing values, and optionally a `getPreviousPageParam` callback if reverse fetching is needed. Finally, a `maxPages` option can be provided to limit the entry cache size.\n\nThe `query` and `queryFn` methods now receive a `{queryArg, pageParam}` object, instead of just the `queryArg`.\n\nFor the cache entries and hooks, the `data` field is now an object like `{pages: ResultType[], pageParams: PageParam[]>`.  This gives you flexibility in how you use the data for rendering.\n\n```ts\nconst pokemonApi = createApi({\n  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: 'https://example.com/pokemon' }),\n  endpoints: (build) => ({\n    // 3 TS generics: page contents, query arg, page param\n    getInfinitePokemonWithMax: build.infiniteQuery<Pokemon[], string, number>({\n      infiniteQueryOptions: {\n        // Must provide a default initial page param value\n        initialPageParam: 1,\n        // Optionally limit the number of cached pages\n        maxPages: 3,\n        // Must provide a `getNextPageParam` function\n        getNextPageParam: (lastPage, allPages, lastPageParam, allPageParams) =>\n          lastPageParam + 1,\n        // Optionally provide a `getPreviousPageParam` function\n        getPreviousPageParam: (\n          firstPage,\n          allPages,\n          firstPageParam,\n          allPageParams,\n        ) => {\n          return firstPageParam > 0 ? firstPageParam - 1 : undefined\n        },\n      },\n      // The `query` function receives `{queryArg, pageParam}` as its argument\n      query({ queryArg, pageParam }) {\n        return `/type/${queryArg}?page=${pageParam}`\n      },\n    }),\n  }),\n})\n```\n\nAs with all RTKQ functionality, the core logic is UI-agnostic and does not require React.  However, using the RTKQ React entry point will also auto-generate `useInfiniteQuery` hooks for these endpoints.  Infinite query hooks fetch the initial page, then provide `fetchNext/PreviousPage` functions to let you trigger requests for more pages.\n\n```ts\nfunction PokemonList({\n    pokemonType = 'fire',\n  }: {\n    pokemonType?: string\n   ) {\n  const {\n    data,\n    isFetching,\n    isSuccess,\n    fetchNextPage,\n    fetchPreviousPage,\n    refetch,\n  } = api.useGetInfinitePokemonInfiniteQuery(pokemonType)\n\n  const handlePreviousPage = async () => {\n    const res = await fetchPreviousPage()\n  }\n\n  const handleNextPage = async () => {\n    const res = await fetchNextPage()\n  }\n  \n  // `data` is a `{pages, pageParams}` object.\n  // You can use those to render whatever UI you need.\n  // In this case, flatten per-page arrays of results for this endpoint\n  // into a single array to render a list.\n  const allPokemon = data?.pages.flat() ?? [];\n\n  // render UI with pages, show loading state, fetch as needed\n}\n```\n\n##### Docs and Examples\n\nThe RTK Query docs have been updated with new content and explanations for infinite queries:\n\n- [Usage Guides: Infinite Queries](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/infinite-queries) covers the new concepts, explains how to define infinite query endpoints and use the hooks, documents fetching behaviors, and describes common API interaction patterns\n- [API Reference: `createApi`](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/api/createApi) documents the new infinite query endpoint options\n- [Generated API Slices: React Hooks](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/api/created-api/hooks) has been updated to better organize the hook descriptions, and covers the infinite query hook arguments and behaviors\n\nWe've also added a new [infinite query example app](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/tree/master/examples/query/react/infinite-queries) in the repo that shows several usage patterns like pagination, cursors, infinite scrolling, and limit+offset queries.\n\n##### Notes\n\nAs with all new features and functionality, more code does mean an increase in bundle size.\n\nWe did [extensive work to byte-shave and optimize the final bundle size for this feature](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4804).  Final estimates indicate that this adds about 4.2Kmin to production bundles.  That's comparable to React Query's infinite query support size.\n\nHowever, given RTKQ's current architecture, that bundle size increase is included even if you aren't using any infinite query endpoints in your application.  Given the significant additional functionality, that seems like an acceptable tradeoff. (And as always, having this kind of functionality built into RTKQ means that your app benefits when it uses this feature without having to add a lot of additional code to your own app, which would likely be much larger.)\n\nLonger-term, we hope to investigate reworking some of RTKQ's internal architecture to potentially make some of the features opt-in for better bundle size optimizations, but don't have a timeline for that work.\n\n##### Thanks\n\nThis new feature wouldn't have been possible without huge amounts of assistance from several people.  We'd like to thank:\n\n- [@&#8203;tkdodo](https://redirect.github.com/tkdodo) of TanStack Query, for happily letting us reuse the API design and implementation approach that they worked hard to figure out, and offering us his advice and knowledge on why they made specific design choices\n- [@&#8203;riqts](https://redirect.github.com/riqts) , for [building the first initial POC draft PR](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4393) long before we were even ready to begin thinking about this ourselves\n- [@&#8203;remus-selea](https://redirect.github.com/remus-selea) and [@&#8203;agusterodin](https://redirect.github.com/agusterodin) , for trying out various stages of the draft PRs and offering significant detailed feedback and bug reports as I iterated on the implementation\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- \\[API Concept] - Infinite Query API by [@&#8203;riqts](https://redirect.github.com/riqts) in [#&#8203;4393](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4393)\n- RTKQ Infinite Query integration by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;4738](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4738)\n\nand numerous specific sub-PRs that went into that integration PR as I worked through the implementation over the last few months.\n\n**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.5.1...v2.6.0>\n\n### [`v2.5.1`](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.5.1)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.5.0...v2.5.1)\n\nThis **bugfix release** fixes a logic issue with the new `upsertQueryEntries` util that sometimes kept entries in a `pending` state indefinitely.\n\n#### Changelog\n\n##### `upsertQueryEntries` fixes\n\nUsers reported that in some cases, use of `upsertQueryEntries` to insert RTKQ cache entries prevented any further refetches of that data from happening.

It now always checks both effect + type.\n\n##### Additional TS Types\n\nWe now export `Typed[Query|Mutation]OnQueryStarted` helpers to let you define `onQueryStarted` callbacks outside of `createApi` if desired.\n\nWe also now export a `CreateAsyncThunkFunction` type that can be used to type userland wrappers around `createAsyncThunk`.\n\n##### TS Support Matrix Updates\n\nWe've historically tried to maintain TS backwards compatibility as long as possible, and made occasional updates to our TS support matrix in minor versions over time.  As of RTK 2.3.0, we officially supported back through TS 4.7.\n\nAs of this release, we're tweaking that support policy to match [the policy used by DefinitelyTyped](https://redirect.github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped?tab=readme-ov-file#support-window):\n\n> Definitely Typed only tests packages on versions of TypeScript that are less than 2 years old\n> ![image](https://redirect.github.com/user-attachments/assets/30c8c1e6-db37-4ef1-a323-1c935fe4a12d)\n\nGiven that, **we've dropped official support for TS versions earlier than 5.0**.  (RTK *may* work with those versions, but we no longer test against them and won't try to fix issues with those versions.)\n\nWe'll continue to update our TS support matrix over time based on that 2-year rolling window.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- add example to reproduce defect of serializeQueryArgs with skipToken by [@&#8203;Themezv](https://redirect.github.com/Themezv) in [#&#8203;4708](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4708)\n- Read `window.rAF` later to allow fake timers to work correctly by [@&#8203;ensconced](https://redirect.github.com/ensconced) in [#&#8203;4701](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4701)\n- Add type helpers for `OnQueryStarted` callbacks by [@&#8203;aryaemami59](https://redirect.github.com/aryaemami59) in [#&#8203;4713](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4713)\n- Add a type for `createAsyncThunk` without the `withTypes` method by [@&#8203;EskiMojo14](https://redirect.github.com/EskiMojo14) in [#&#8203;4667](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4667)\n- Add ability to reset lazy query hooks by [@&#8203;alexmotoc](https://redirect.github.com/alexmotoc) in [#&#8203;4689](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4689)\n- Ignore nullish values in tag invalidations by [@&#8203;pierroberto](https://redirect.github.com/pierroberto) in [#&#8203;4671](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4671)\n- Allow passing meta to retry.fail, and passing baseQuery to ensure types match by [@&#8203;EskiMojo14](https://redirect.github.com/EskiMojo14) in [#&#8203;4723](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4723)\n- Keep `isSuccess: true` when switching to an uninitialized cache entry by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;4731](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4731)\n- Keep `isSuccess` consistent when refetching after an error by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;4732](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4732)\n- Update to new version of upsert proposal, and fix listener equality checks by [@&#8203;EskiMojo14](https://redirect.github.com/EskiMojo14) in [#&#8203;4735](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4735)\n\n**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.3.0...v2.4.0>\n\n### [`v2.3.0`](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.3.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.2.8...v2.3.0)\n\nThis **feature release** adds a new RTK Query `upsertQueryEntries` util to batch-upsert cache entries more efficiently, passes through additional values for use in `prepareHeaders`, and exports additional TS types around query options and selectors.\n\n#### Changelog\n\n##### `upsertQueryEntries`\n\nRTK Query already had an `upsertQueryData` thunk that would upsert a single cache entry. However, some users wanted to upsert *many* cache entries (potentially hundreds or thousands), and found that `upsertQueryData` had poor performance in those cases. This is because `upsertQueryData` runs the full async request handling sequence, including dispatching both `pending` and `fulfilled` actions, each of which run the main reducer and update store subscribers.   That means there's `2N` store / UI updates per item, so upserting hundreds of items becomes extremely perf-intensive.\n\nRTK Query now includes an `api.util.upsertQueryEntries` action that is meant to handle the batched upsert use case more efficiently. It's a single synchronous action that accepts an array of many `{endpointName, arg, value}` entries to upsert.  This results in a single store update, making this vastly better for performance vs many individual `upsertQueryData` calls.\n\nWe see this as having two main use cases. The first is prefilling the cache with data retrieved from storage on app startup (and it's worth noting that `upsertQueryEntries` can accept entries for many different endpoints as part of the same array).\n\nThe second is to act as a \"pseudo-normalization\" tool. [RTK Query is *not* a \"normalized\" cache](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/usage/cache-behavior#no-normalized-or-de-duplicated-cache). However, there are times when you may want to prefill other cache entries with the contents of another endpoint, such as taking the results of a `getPosts` list endpoint response and prefilling the individual `getPost(id)` endpoint cache entries, so that components that reference an individual item endpoint already have that data available.\n\nCurrently, you can implement the \"pseudo-normalization\" approach by dispatching `upsertQueryEntries` in an endpoint lifecycle, like this:\n\n```ts\nconst api = createApi({\n  endpoints: (build) => ({\n    getPosts: build.query<Post[], void>({\n      query: () => '/posts',\n      async onQueryStarted(_, { dispatch, queryFulfilled }) {\n        const res = await queryFulfilled\n        const posts = res.data\n\n        // Pre-fill the individual post entries with the results\n        // from the list endpoint query\n        dispatch(\n          api.util.upsertQueryEntries(\n            posts.map((post) => ({\n              endpointName: 'getPost',\n              arg: { id: post.id },\n              value: post,\n            })),\n          ),\n        )\n      },\n    }),\n    getPost: build.query<Post, Pick<Post, 'id'>>({\n      query: (post) => `post/${post.id}`,\n    }),\n  }),\n})\n```\n\nDown the road we may add a new option to query endpoints that would let you provide the mapping function and have it automatically update the corresponding entries.\n\nFor additional comparisons between `upsertQueryData` and `upsertQueryEntries`, see [the `upsertQueryEntries` API reference](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/api/created-api/api-slice-utils#upsertqueryentries).\n\n##### `prepareHeaders` Options\n\nThe [`prepareHeaders` callback for `fetchBaseQuery`](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/api/fetchBaseQuery#prepareheaders) now receives two additional values in the `api` argument:\n\n- `arg`: the URL string or `FetchArgs` object that was passed in to `fetchBaseQuery` for this endpoint\n- `extraOptions`: any extra options that were provided to the base query\n\n##### Additional TS Types\n\nWe've added a `TypedQueryStateSelector` type that can be used to pre-type selectors for use with `selectFromResult`:\n\n```ts\nconst typedSelectFromResult: TypedQueryStateSelector<\n  PostsApiResponse,\n  QueryArgument,\n  BaseQueryFunction,\n  SelectedResult\n> = (state) => ({ posts: state.data?.posts ?? EMPTY_ARRAY })\n\nfunction PostsList() {\n  const { posts } = useGetPostsQuery(undefined, {\n    selectFromResult: typedSelectFromResult,\n  })\n}\n```\n\nWe've also exported several additional TS types around base queries and tag definitions.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- Fix serializeQueryArgs type by [@&#8203;Reedgern](https://redirect.github.com/Reedgern) in [#&#8203;4658](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4658)\n- Add the `TypedQueryStateSelector` helper type by [@&#8203;aryaemami59](https://redirect.github.com/aryaemami59) in [#&#8203;4656](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4656)\n- Pass query args to prepareHeaders function by [@&#8203;kyletsang](https://redirect.github.com/kyletsang) in [#&#8203;4638](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4638)\n- Implement a util function to batch-upsert cache entries by [@&#8203;markerikson](https://redirect.github.com/markerikson) in [#&#8203;4561](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4561)\n- fetchBaseQuery: expose extraOptions to prepareHeaders by [@&#8203;phryneas](https://redirect.github.com/phryneas) in [#&#8203;4291](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4291)\n\n**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.2.8...v2.3.0>\n\n### [`v2.2.8`](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.2.8)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.2.7...v2.2.8)\n\nThis **bugfix** release fixes a long-standing issue with RTK Query lazy query triggers returning stale data in some cases, fixes an error handling issue in RTK Query, and exports additional TS types.\n\n#### Changelog\n\n##### Lazy Query Trigger Handling\n\nWe'd had a couple long-standing issues reporting that `const result = await someLazyQueryTrigger()` sometimes returned stale data, especially if a mutation had just invalidated that query's tag.\n\nWe finally got a good repro of this issue and identified it as a mis-written call inside of the middleware that skipped past the necessary handling to activate the correct query status tracking in that scenario.  This should now be fixed.\n\n##### Other Changes\n\nTimeout handling in RTKQ endpoints should now correctly throw a timeout-related error instead of an `AbortError`.\n\nBase queries now have access to the current `queryCacheKey` value so it can be used in deciding query logic.\n\nWe've exported several more TS types related to query options, as some users have been depending on those even though they previously weren't part of the public API.\n\n#### What's Changed\n\n- Export `QueryExtraOptions` and `MutationExtraOptions` by [@&#8203;aryaemami59](https://redirect.github.com/aryaemami59) in [#&#8203;4556](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4556)\n- Fix `mangleErrors` not preserving different error types by [@&#8203;aryaemami59](https://redirect.github.com/aryaemami59) in [#&#8203;4586](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4586)\n- Add the `TypedUseQueryStateOptions` helper type by [@&#8203;aryaemami59](https://redirect.github.com/aryaemami59) in [#&#8203;4604](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4604)\n- feat(baseQuery): expose queryCacheKey in baseQuery by [@&#8203;HaakonSvane](https://redirect.github.com/HaakonSvane) in [#&#8203;4636](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4636)\n- Fix `AbortError` being triggered incorrectly on `createApi` endpoint timeout by [@&#8203;andrejpavlovic](https://redirect.github.com/andrejpavlovic) in [#&#8203;4628](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4628)\n- type: export QueryReturnValue by [@&#8203;hornta](https://redirect.github.com/hornta) in [#&#8203;4640](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4640)\n- call `initiate` to refetch queries from middleware by [@&#8203;phryneas](https://redirect.github.com/phryneas) in [#&#8203;4651](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/4651)\n\n**Full Changelog**: <https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.2.7...v2.2.8>\n\n### [`v2.2.7`](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.2.7)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/compare/v2.2.6...v2.2.7)\n\nThis **bugfix release** fixes issues with \"TS type portability\" errors, improves build artifact tree shaking behavior, and exports some additional TS types.\n\n#### Changelog\n\n##### TS Type Portability\n\nWe've had a slew of issues reported around \"TS type portability\" errors, such as:\n\n- [#&#8203;1806](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/1806)\n- [#&#8203;3962](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3962)\n- [#&#8203;3983](https://redirect.github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/issues/3983)\n\nThe error messages are typically along the lines of:\n\n> Type error: The \n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - At any time (no schedule defined), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.
