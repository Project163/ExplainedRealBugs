bundler is a tool that puts together all your JavaScript code (and any other formats that can be transpiled into JavaScript code, e.g. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)) and its dependencies and throws a new JavaScript output file with everything merged, ready for the web, commonly known as the bundle file.\r\n\r\nAs of [`v4.4.1`](https://github.com/EPICLab/synectic/releases/tag/v4.4.1), we utilize [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as our bundler. But there are other options available:\r\n\r\n- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), written in JavaScript and introduced in 2011\r\n- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), written in JavaScript and introduced in 2014\r\n- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), written in JavaScript and introduced in 2017\r\n- [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), written in JavaScript and introduced in 2018\r\n- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), written in TypeScript and introduced in 2020\r\n- [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack), written in Rust and introduced in 2022\r\n\r\nWe focus on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a replacement for [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Per the Vite [_Getting Started_](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#overview) page:\r\n\r\n> [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:\r\n>\r\n> * A dev server that provides [rich feature enhancements](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html) over [native ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), for example extremely fast [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).\r\n>\r\n> * A build command that bundles your code with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.\r\n>\r\n> Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box. Read about what's possible in the [Features Guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html). Support for frameworks or integration with other tools is possible through [Plugins](https://vitejs.dev/guide/using-plugins.html). The [Config Section](https://vitejs.dev/config/) explains how to adapt Vite to your project if needed.\r\n>\r\n> Vite is also highly extensible via its [Plugin API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html) and [JavaScript API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-javascript.html) with full typing support.\r\n>\r\n> You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the [Why Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) section.\r\n\r\nVite offers a variety of [templates](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) for scaffolding various types of Vue, React, Preact, Lit, Svelte, Solid, and Qwik projects (in both JavaScript and TypeScript). And Vite 4.0 uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), replacing [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) which was the built-in compiler in Vite 3.0 and earlier<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\nBut for Synectic, a more direct tool to use is called [`electron-vite`](https://electron-vite.org/), which is:\r\n\r\n> [electron-vite](https://electron-vite.org/) is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). It consists of five major parts:\r\n>\r\n> * A build command that bundles your code with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and able to handle Electron's unique environment including [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and browser environments.\r\n>\r\n> * Centrally configure the main process, renderers and preload scripts Vite configuration, and preconfigure for Electron's unique environment.\r\n>\r\n> * Use fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for renderers, and the main process and preload scripts support hot reloading, extremely improving development efficiency.\r\n>\r\n> * Optimize asset handling for Electron main process.\r\n>\r\n> * Use V8 bytecode to protect source code.\r\n>\r\n> electron-vite is fast, simple and powerful, designed to work out-of-the-box.\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/12/vite-4-faster-swc/","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EPICLab/synectic/issues/1289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/EPICLab/synectic/issues/1289/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
