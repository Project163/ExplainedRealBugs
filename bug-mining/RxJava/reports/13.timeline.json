here's an example where an observable emits `A` instances down the stream and transforms them into `B` instances.\r\n\r\n```java\r\ninterface A<T, R> {}\r\ninterface B<T> {}\r\n\r\n// RxJava 1\r\nstatic <T> rx.Observable.Transformer<A<T, ?>, B<T>> oldStyle() {\r\n    return new rx.Observable.Transformer<A<T, ?>, B<T>>() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public rx.Observable<B<T>> call(rx.Observable<A<T, ?>> a) {\r\n            return rx.Observable.empty();\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n\r\n// RxJava 2\r\nstatic <T> ObservableTransformer<A<T, ?>, B<T>> newStyle() {\r\n    return new ObservableTransformer<A<T, ?>, B<T>>() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public ObservableSource<B<T>> apply(Observable<A<T, ?>> a) {\r\n            return Observable.empty();\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid test() {\r\n    \r\n    A<String, Integer> a = new A<String, Integer>() { };\r\n\r\n    // RxJava 1\r\n    rx.Observable.just(a)\r\n            .compose(TransformersTest.<String>oldStyle())  // Yay, because Integer is irrelevant here\r\n            .subscribe(new Action1<B<String>>() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void call(B<String> stringB) {\r\n\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n\r\n    // RxJava 2\r\n    Observable.just(a)\r\n            .compose(TransformersTest.<String>newStyle())   // This doesn't compile\r\n            .subscribe(new Consumer<B<String>>() {\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void accept(B<String> tB) throws Exception {\r\n\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the RxJava 2 example, the `compose()` line there doesn't compile because of generics issues.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1341\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-01-07 at 11 55 01 pm\"

like the following:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nstatic <T, R> ObservableTransformer<A<T, R>, B<T>> newStyle() {\r\n    return new ObservableTransformer<A<T, R>, B<T>>() {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public ObservableSource<B<T>> apply(Observable<A<T, R>> a) {\r\n            return Observable.empty();\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd imposes some boilerplate on the consumer in that they now have to specify the second type even though it's irrelevant.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nObservable.just(a)\r\n        .compose(TransformersTest.<String, Integer>newStyle())  // :(\r\n        .subscribe(new Consumer<B<String>>() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void accept(B<String> tB) throws Exception {\r\n\r\n            }\r\n
