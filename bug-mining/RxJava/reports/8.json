the latest 0.20.0-RC1 a combination of takeWhile() and toList() on an Observable fails, sometimes. \n\nHere's a unit test that fails:\n\n``` java\n@Test\n    public void testTakeWhile() {\n        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};\n        final AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();\n        for(final int n: nums) {\n            Observable\n                    .from(Boolean.TRUE, Boolean.FALSE)\n                    .takeWhile(new Func1<Boolean, Boolean>() {\n                        @Override\n                        public Boolean call(Boolean value) {\n                            return value;\n                        }\n                    })\n                    .toList()\n                    .doOnNext(new Action1<List<Boolean>>() {\n                        @Override\n                        public void call(List<Boolean> booleans) {\n                            count.incrementAndGet();\n                        }\n                    })\n                    .subscribe();\n        }\n        assertEquals(nums.length, count.get());\n    }\n```\n\nHere's the same unit test that passes with slight modification:\n\n``` java\n@Test\n    public void testTakeWhile() {\n        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};\n        final AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();\n        for(final int n: nums) {\n            Observable\n                    .from(Boolean.TRUE, Boolean.FALSE, Boolean.FALSE)\n                    .takeWhile(new Func1<Boolean, Boolean>() {\n                        @Override\n                        public Boolean call(Boolean value) {\n                            return value;\n                        }\n                    })\n                    .toList()\n                    .doOnNext(new Action1<List<Boolean>>() {\n                        @Override\n
