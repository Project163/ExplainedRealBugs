If not, why not? Or is this a bug?\r\n\r\nMy code example where I'm getting this error is Android based:\r\nI have a HomePresenter with this code:\r\n```\r\nvoid setActivity(Activity activity) {\r\n\tTimber.d(“HomePresenter attachActivity”);\r\n\tthis.activity = activity;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid onStart() {\r\n\tTimber.d(“HomePresenter onStart”);\r\n\tdisposables.add(api.getEmail()\r\n\t\t.subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())\r\n\t\t.observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())\r\n\t\t.subscribe(email -> {\r\n\t\t\tTimber.d(“email was %s”, email);\r\n\t\t\tactivity.setEmail(email);\r\n\t\t})\r\n\t);\r\n```\r\n```\r\nvoid onStop() {\r\n\tTimber.d(“HomePresenter onStop”);\r\n\tdisposables.clear();\r\n\tactivity = null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin the logs I see:\r\n```\r\nLifecycle onStart HomeActivity\r\nHomePresenter attachActivity\r\nHomePresenter onStart\r\nLifecycle onStop HomeActivity\r\nHomePresenter onStop\r\nemail was foo@bar.com\r\nNullPointerException: attempt to invoke virtual method Activity.setEmail(String) on null object reference\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems the subscription to the observable was cleared before the `onSuccess` method was called.\r\n\r\nOr maybe I'm missing something else completely, anyways, thanks for the help :)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"akarnokd","id":1269832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjk4MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1269832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd","html_url":"https://github.com/akarnokd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/5742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/5742/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
