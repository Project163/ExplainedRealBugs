no, the problem cannot be remidied in kotlin which completely prevents the usage of that operator in kotlin. \r\nRemoving the annotation won't make it nullable though, it would just mean that we don't

Why is it important to keep it? I see very little harm in removing it and as @svenjacobs said the contract is broken in java too.

2.1.0)\r\nThe `GroupedObservable`'s key that the group was created with is annotated as `Nullable` (in both the return type and in the constructor parameter).\r\n\r\nHowever, the key is only ever created from the `keySelector` (in `ObservableGroupBy`), which is declared as a Function (and hence has `@NonNull` return type). It should therefore be considered a warning to return a null key for a group.\r\n\r\nI propose that RxJava actively verifies that the returned key is non-null and then change the `Nullable` annotations in `GroupedObservable` to `NonNull` correspondingly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/5448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/5448/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1140467641,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTE0MDQ2NzY0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/events/1140467641","actor":{"login":"akarnokd","id":1269832,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjk4MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1269832?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd","html_url":"https://github.com/akarnokd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarnokd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-27T13:11:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
