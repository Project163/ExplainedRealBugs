actually, I know little about Java type inference. I try the following codes and it works:\n\n``` java\nimport rx.Observable;\nimport rx.functions.*;\n\npublic class Issue1550 {\n\n    static class User {\n        String name;\n        int age;\n\n        User(String name, int age) {\n            this.name = name;\n            this.age = age;\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Func0<Observable<User>> empty = () -> Observable.empty();\n        Func1<User, Observable<User>> just = (User user) -> Observable.just(user);\n        savedUser().flatMap(\n                just,\n                e -> fetchUser(),\n                empty)\n        .forEach(user -> System.out.println(user.name));\n    }\n\n    static Observable<User> savedUser() {\n        return Observable.error(new IllegalStateException(\"there are no saved users\"));\n    }\n\n    static Observable<User> fetchUser() {\n        return Observable.just(new User(\"Adel\", 13));\n    }\n\n}\n\n```\n\nSo I guess it's a weakness of Java type inference. Looks we have to write a temp variable to tell the compiler type information.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/comments/58317436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":175588390,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc1NTg4Mzkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/events/175588390","actor":{"login":"benjchristensen","id":813492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzQ5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen","html_url":"https://github.com/benjchristensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-10-08T06:50:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":175588391,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3NTU4ODM5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/events/175588391","actor":{"login":"benjchristensen","id":813492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzQ5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen","html_url":"https://github.com/benjchristensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-10-08T06:50:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/comments/58319096","html_url":"https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/1550#issuecomment-58319096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/1550","id":58319096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MzE5MDk2","user":{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"
