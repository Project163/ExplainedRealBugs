For example, consider the following:\n\n``` java\nCluster cluster = new CouchbaseCluster(\"127.0.0.1\");\nBucket bucket = cluster.openBucket().toBlockingObservable().single();\n\nDocument doc = JsonDocument.create(\"hello\", JsonObject.empty().put(\"Hello\", \"World\"));\nbucket.upsert(doc).toBlockingObservable().single();\n\nSystem.out.println(bucket.get(\"hello\").toBlockingObservable().single());\n```\n\nEspecially if you are dealing a lot with just a single value, something like `await()` on the observable would be good, or some shorter way/alias name. To be honest I'm not sure if this is possible, but I also thought about shipping a helper class which just wraps the calls like `BlockingUtils(observable).single()` or something like this. \n","closed_by":{"login":"benjchristensen","id":813492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzQ5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen","html_url":"https://github.com/benjchristensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/1220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/1220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
