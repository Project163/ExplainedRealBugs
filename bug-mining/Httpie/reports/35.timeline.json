I recently switched to it after using `resty` for ages.\n\nOne of the nice features i am missing is a way to set a base url that will be used for subsequent `http` invocations.\n\nI often find myself issuing multiple rest calls when testing/browsing an API and defining a base url saves me from a lot of typing.\n\nFor example, assume the following base url:\n\n```\nhttps://api.example.com/api/v1\n```\n\nWhen issuing the following command\n\n```\nhttp GET /users\n```\n\nWill do a GET request to the resource located at `https://api.example.com/api/v1/users`.\n\nCurrently I solve my impediment by applying the following patch to the `httpie` library\n\n```\ndiff --git a/httpie/input.py b/httpie/input.py\nindex 8eb6a7d..e49079d 100644\n--- a/httpie/input.py\n+++ b/httpie/input.py\n@@ -131,6 +131,8 @@ class Parser(ArgumentParser):\n         self._parse_items()\n         if not self.args.ignore_stdin and not env.stdin_isatty:\n             self._body_from_file(self.env.stdin)\n+        if 'HTTPIE_BASEURL' in os.environ:\n+            self.args.url = os.environ['HTTPIE_BASEURL'].rstrip('/') + self.args.url\n         if not (self.args.url.startswith((HTTP, HTTPS))):\n             scheme = HTTP\n```\n\nThis allows me to define a base url for the current running shell:\n\n```\nexport HTTPIE_BASEURL='https://api.example.com/api/v1'\nhttp GET /users\nhttp GET /users/8292\n```\n\nI am curious what you think about this approach and maybe have a better idea.\nI would be happy to contribute to this idea if needed.\n\nKeep up the great work.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/215/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/215/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":118356778,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MTE4MzU2Nzc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/events/118356778","actor":{"login":"jkbrzt","id":326885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjg4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbrzt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-05-06T18:09:31Z","rename":{"from":"Profile

I started with\r\n\r\n    function girder {\r\n        https --session=~/.girder_session.json girder.host.local.lan/api/v1/$1 ${@:2}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nbut my main problem is that I cannot change the HTTP method (e.g. to PUT or PATCH) this way. I would like to be able to have a different way of specifying the default host, so that I do not have to add a commandline parsing around httpie. And I do have some hope, since httpie *already* supports a default hostname, only that it's hardcoded to be localhost.\r\n\r\nI see two potential solutions:\r\n1. #215 contains a small change introducing an environment variable for the default host, which would solve my issue.\r\n2. Another idea I had (more in the line of #180) would be to make the default hostname an optional part of the sessions. Maybe that could even be made to work with named sessions, by looking into a \"default\" host directory: `~/.httpie/sessions/default/<name>.json`\r\n\r\nWith both solutions, the above shell function could be turned into a simple alias passing the desired `--session` parameter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/838/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/838/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
