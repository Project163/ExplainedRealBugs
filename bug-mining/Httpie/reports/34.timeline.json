wasn't able to recreate the issue directly, since I couldn't find a live Drupal installation to test against, but I noticed a lot of servers were returning \"application/ld+json\" responses just fine.  I suspect the Drupal installation (or perhaps the server sitting in front of it) is just set to be overly strict about the \"Accept\" header.  As a mitigation step, perhaps you could adjust the server or application to be more lenient.\n\nIt looks like httpie has support for custom headers, so perhaps that is the best alternative here (i.e. calling \"http GET example.com Accepts:application/hal+json\").

I think I might understand what I've been doing wrong. I assumed that predefined content types would be the only \"types\" available, without understanding the full granularity brought by passing custom Accept headers.\n\nSo, here's what I've just been doing:\n\n`$ http -h GET rest.local/node/1 \"Accept: application/hal+json\"\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nCache-Control: must-revalidate, no-cache, post-check=0, pre-check=0, private\nContent-Type: application/hal+json\nContent-language: en\nDate: Mon, 07 Apr 2014 11:55:15 GMT\nETag: \"1396871715\"\nExpires: Sun, 19 Nov 1978 05:00:00 GMT\nLast-Modified: Mon, 07 Apr 2014 11:55:15 GMT\nServer: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.9-1ubuntu3\nX-UA-Compatible: IE=edge,chrome=1`\n\nThis does look to me like it is working better now, correct?\n\n@jkbr unfortunately Drupal 8 isn't yet available as a full release (beta should come out soon) so there's no live site I could point you to. What I'd suggest for the time being if you do want to test things out with an on-demand D8-dev site is that you:\n- Follow [this link](http://simplytest.me/project/drupal) and select the **8.x branch** in the dropdown.\n- Click click click until Drupal is installed.\n- Once you've got the test site installed, visit **admin/modules** and scroll down to the **Web Services section**.\n- Click the checkbox for the **HAL** module and press **Save Configuration** (this will enable its dependencies: **RESTful Web Services** and **Serialization**).\n- Now visit **node/add/article** and publish a dummy article.\n- Next, visit **admin/people/permissions** and search for the **Access GET on Content resource** permission. Give the permission to **anonymous users** and save.\n- You should be able to hit the new node with HAL+JSON (Drupal 8's default) at `$ http GET http://{simplytestme_unique_id}.simplytest.me/node/1 \"Accept: application/hal+json\"`\n\nHope that
