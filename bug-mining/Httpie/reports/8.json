Otherwise it is url.\n\nThere are some complexity of implementing such behavior raises due to usage of argparse module, but in my opinion such shortcut would be very helpful in everyday usage of httpie.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jkbrzt","id":326885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjg4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbrzt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/54/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/54/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
