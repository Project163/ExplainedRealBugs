But I understand your point of view and tend to agree that form data would've been a more sensible default.\n\nI'm not sure if it's a good idea to make such a big backwards-incompatible change now (although the introduction of a config file would make it easier for people used to JSON being default).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/comments/8362683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jkbrzt","id":326885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjg4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbrzt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/comments/8373125","html_url":"https://github.com/httpie/cli/issues/91#issuecomment-8373125","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/91","id":8373125,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzNzMxMjU=","user":{"login":"ryangreenberg","id":134712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDcxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134712?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryangreenberg","html_url":"https://github.com/ryangreenberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryangreenberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryangreenberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryangreenberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryangreenberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryangreenberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryangreenberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryangreenberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryangreenberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryangreenberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-09-07T17:51:38Z","updated_at":"2012-09-07T17:51:38Z","body":"Great--I'm sure that whichever default makes sense depends primarily on what type of services you interact with most often.
