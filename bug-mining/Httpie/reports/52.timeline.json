Doing so causes `http: error: Cannot use --output, -o with redirected output.`\r\n\r\nI have tried all sorts of combinations of `--download` and `--output`, as well as `--ignore-stdin` suggested from https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie/issues/290, which is pointed to by https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie/issues/402, and I can't get anything to work.\r\n\r\nI can't find anything in the docs that addresses this. Let's take a closer look:\r\n```\r\n  --output FILE, -o FILE\r\n      Save output to FILE. If --download is set, then only the response body is\r\n      saved to the file. Other parts of the HTTP exchange are printed to stderr.\r\n```\r\n```\r\n  --download, -d\r\n      Do not print the response body to stdout. Rather, download it and store it\r\n      in a file. The filename is guessed unless specified with --output\r\n      [filename]. This action is similar to the default behaviour of wget.\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of outputting the response body to stdout, it goes to a file. And the rest goes to stderr. Why shouldn't I be able to redirect stdout (which should have nothing) and stderr to a file?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it seems to imply that it is trying to mimic wget. But this works fine with wget.\r\n\r\nHere are some more details comparing behavior in wget, curl, and http. First, I have scripts that download a file in each. Run with no output redirection, they work fine. All scripts start with `#!/bin/bash -ex`, so the output here is somewhat self documenting.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./test-wget.sh\r\n+ url=https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png\r\n+ out_dir=./out\r\n+ mkdir -p ./out\r\n+ wget -O ./out/google-wget.png https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png\r\n--2019-02-26 12:21:18--  https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png\r\nResolving www.google.com (www.google.com)... 172.217.0.36, 2607:f8b0:4005:802::2004\r\nConnecting to www.google.com (www.google.com)|172.217.0.36|:443... connected.\r\nHTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\r\nLength: 5969 (5.8K) [image/png]\r\nSaving to: ‘./out/google-wget.png’\r\n\r\n./out/google-wget.png                     100%[=====================================================================================>]   5.83K  --.-KB/s    in 0s      \r\n\r\n2019-02-26 12:21:18 (36.4 MB/s) - ‘./out/google-wget.png’ saved [5969/5969]\r\n\r\nrich@rich16 [12:21:18 Tue Feb 26]:~/git/ll/users/rich/bugs/ra-7189/test\r\n$ ./test-curl.sh \r\n+ url=https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png\r\n+ out_dir=./out\r\n+ mkdir -p ./out\r\n+ curl -o ./out/google-curl.png https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png\r\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n100  5969  100  5969    0     0  35264      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 35319\r\nrich@rich16 [12:21:23 Tue Feb 26]:~/git/ll/users/rich/bugs/ra-7189/test\r\n$ ./test-http.sh \r\n+ url=https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png\r\n+ out_dir=./out\r\n+ mkdir -p ./out\r\n+ http --download https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png --output ./out/google-http.png\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\r\nAlt-Svc: quic=\":443\";

It works fine for wget and curl, and this is IMHO a fairly annoying limitation.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, noting this in the docs for `--output` might be worthwhile.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/756/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
