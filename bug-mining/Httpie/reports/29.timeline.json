my case, `http` was being invoked as part of a BsdMakefile script. `bmake` helpfully buffers IO when performing a parallel make (`make -jX`) so that lines from various rule outputs are not intermixed. httpie was detecting this as `stdin` and reporting an error about conflicting input streams (command line and STDIN).\r\n\r\nBefore looking up #150 or even Googling the issue, I correctly surmised that was the case, and attempted to work around it by explicitly closing `STDIN`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nhttp POST \"https://neosmart.net/xxxx\" authcode=\"xxxx\" version=\"5.5.2\" 0<&-\r\nusage: http
