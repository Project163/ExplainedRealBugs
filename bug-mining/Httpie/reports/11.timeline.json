(http --version gives 0.2.6dev for me) As I mention in my pull request, I had to change the stdout writing to a single print statement to get it working.\n\nAs a proof, here's a screenshot showing installation from the dev branch (on the left) and then from my fork (on the right):\nhttp://grab.by/eRsq\n\nI also had to install 'requests' separately, because the one provided by pip didn't work on my system. But by installing requests directly from their git repo worked flawesly.\n\nI'm totally newbie with python, pip and colorama, and quite newbie also with github, so I'm sorry if this is just some Stupid User Error. But I still think that there is something wrong with outputting to the cmd.exe window, and my pull request seems to fix it.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/comments/7095400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kaplas","id":1321686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE2ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1321686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas","html_url":"https://github.com/kaplas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":20598711,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwNTk4NzEx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/events/20598711","actor":{"login":"kaplas","id":1321686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjE2ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1321686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas","html_url":"https://github.com/kaplas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaplas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-07-19T11:01:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/comments/7095970","html_url":"https://github.com/httpie/cli/issues/36#issuecomment-7095970","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/36","id":7095970,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwOTU5NzA=","user":{"login":"mieky","id":299644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/299644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mieky","html_url":"https://github.com/mieky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mieky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mieky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mieky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mieky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mieky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mieky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mieky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mieky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mieky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-07-19T11:34:22Z","updated_at":"2012-07-19T11:34:22Z","body":"At a quick glance it would seem that a simple 'print output' (without any explicit encoding being done) works nicely on both Windows and OS X.
