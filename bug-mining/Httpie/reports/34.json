If yes, is there any plan to support this?\n\nFYI, currently I'm using cURL with basic auth such as below:\n\n`$ curl --user root:root -H \"Accept: application/hal+json\" --request GET http://head.local/entity/node/1`\n","closed_by":{"login":"jkbrzt","id":326885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjg4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbrzt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbrzt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/httpie/cli/issues/189/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
