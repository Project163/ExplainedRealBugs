the PR introduces correct behaviour or not depends on the implementation of the `round(...)` method.\nWhat we basically want is to display the lowest VISIBLE index.\n\nThis means if the edge of the chart is at 0.01 or 1, the lowest visible x-index returned by the method should be 1.\n\nAccording to [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/26351144/1590502) post, the round method does is round up for everything >= 0.5\nThis would introduce incorrect behaviour for values between 0.01 and 0.49, because those values would be rounded down but actually should be rounded up.\n\nI think the `ceil(...)` method should be used to force rounding
