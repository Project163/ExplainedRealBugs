The code for AxisBase.axisMaximum is:\n\n```\nopen var axisMaximum: Double\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return _axisMaximum\n    }\n    set\n    {\n        _customAxisMax = true\n        _axisMaximum = newValue\n        axisRange = abs(_axisMaximum - newValue) // Always results in a range of zero.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis results in axisRange is always being set to zero, because newValue has the same value as _axisMaximum. Making the following change fixed the problem:\n\n```\nopen var axisMaximum: Double\n{\n    get\n    {\n        return _axisMaximum\n    }\n    set\n    {\n        _customAxisMax = true\n        _axisMaximum = newValue\n   axisRange = abs(_axisMaximum - _axisMinimum)\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"danielgindi","id":366926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjkyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi","html_url":"https://github.com/danielgindi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/1603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/1603/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
