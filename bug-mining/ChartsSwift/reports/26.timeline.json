Do you take some actions, like filtering the data leads to no data?\nWhat's your data looks like? how many x values and y vlaues?\nYou can take a look at the 'data' setter. It should not draw the grid line. \n\n``` swift\n        set\n        {\n            if (newValue == nil || newValue?.yValCount == 0) <-- yours may be  if (newValue == nil)\n            {\n

there is one scenario: if we have a filter, when filting 'all', it show 10 bars, and if we filt and lead it to no data, currently, the bars are still there. Would it be better to do a redraw and show nothing? Like leave an empty axis, range from [0,1].
