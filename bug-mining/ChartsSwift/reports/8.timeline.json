  With further investigation, I think a very small view frame can easily be impacted. for exmaple, what I am doing is create a thumb view, the height is only 40. and ios-charts is doing calculations, leads to the viewPortHandler.contentRect has a very small height or even negative height. \n\neven I manually set the offset like this:\n\n``` swift\n    self.thumbView.data = radarData;\n    [self.thumbView.viewPortHandler restrainViewPortWithOffsetLeft:0 offsetTop:0 offsetRight:0 offsetBottom:0];\n```\n\nHowever, in ChartViewBase: drawRect, \n\n``` swift\n        if
