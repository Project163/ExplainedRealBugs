The graph has set setVisibleXRangeMaximum(9.0) but has more than 30 values, so the user can scroll on the graph.\n\nI could center the selected bar on the screen when the user tap on some of the graph bars, but I can't animate it. I am using moveViewToX() method to move to an specific index. Is there a way to do the same as \"moveViewToX()\" does but animated?\n","closed_by":{"login":"danielgindi","id":366926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjkyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi","html_url":"https://github.com/danielgindi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/318/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/318/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
