I've been looking for a good charting library for sometime now. Highly appreciated. I tried testing this today and getting the above error. I'm trying this in Xcode Version 6.3 (6D520o). \n\nIt is happening at two files in the library. I'm posting the final error message for both of them \n\n```\nWhile emitting IR SIL function @_TFC6Charts21CombinedChartRenderer15createRenderersfS0_FT_T_ for 'createRenderers' at /ios-charts/Charts/Classes/Renderers/CombinedChartRenderer.swift:50:14\n\nWhile emitting IR SIL function @_TFC6Charts19ChartLegendRenderer12renderLegendfS0_FT7contextCSo9CGContext6legendGSQCS_11ChartLegend__T_ for 'renderLegend' at /ios-charts/Charts/Classes/Renderers/ChartLegendRenderer.swift:104:12\n\n```\n\nCan you let me know how to get rid of those ?\n\nTried : \n1. When I comment out the switch cases in the respective functions (createRenderers, renderLegend) it compiles fine. Although I hardly think it's a solution. \n","closed_by":{"login":"danielgindi","id":366926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjkyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi","html_url":"https://github.com/danielgindi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
