I have this issue in CombinedChartView with CandleChartData, but as I can see in demo - plain Candle Stick Chart has the same issue. Chart is fully zoomed out. I know about fitBars property for BarChart, but it's not applicable for candle stick chart(\n\n![screen shot 2016-10-17 at 19 45 29](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4547974/19446647/5f1e0e64-94a2-11e6-944b-19a9b5ca6f1c.png)\n\nCalculating and setting xAxis.axisMaximum manually to be (candleWidth/2) larger than last candle's X-value would be the best decision?
