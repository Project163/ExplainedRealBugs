realm.objects(MinMaxMeasure)\n\nlet set: RealmLineDataSet = RealmLineDataSet(results: results, xValueField: \"Myvalue\", yValueField: \"MyValue\", label: \"MySeries\")\n\n```\n\nthe error says:\n\n```\ncannot convert value of type Results<MinMaxMeasure> to expected arguments RLMResults<RLMObjects>\n```\n\nI get the point, but cannot understand if this depends from a wrong version of swift, a bug, or something I am not doing properly.\n\nAlso, If I instantiate a RLMRealm instead of a Realm Object, I get no compilation errors, however I have a EXC_BAD_ACCESS on Realm.verify inside the Realm framework.\n\nI am trying to run in a XCode 8 /Swift3 project.\n\n![screen shot 2016-10-02 at 14 52
