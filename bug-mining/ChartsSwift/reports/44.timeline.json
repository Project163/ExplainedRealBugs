Please complete this template before creating pull request. -->\n#### What's in this pull request?\n\nPeople expect strides to allow zero size - like any traditional `for` loop that would have just skipped.\nAdding an additional condition just for that makes the code messier.\n\nBut moreover - Xcode itself expects it to allow `0` length stride.\nAs Xcode automatically converts old `for` loops to strides, it actually **breaks** code that may in some cases have zero-length strides.\n\nExample case:\nhttps://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/issues/931\n\n---\n\n<!-- This selection should only be
