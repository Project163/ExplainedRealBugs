High quality products, both.\n\nI wanted to explore the possibility of porting both libraries to [Xamarin.Forms](https://xamarin.com/forms). Xamarin.Forms is a relatively new C# API made by Xamarin that provides cross-platform sharing of UI code. The supported platforms are iOS, Android and Windows.\n\nWhile I've witnessed Xamarin.Forms substantially lessen overhead in cross-platform development, the project currently has a relatively scant selection of open-source components. With a common API between the iOS and Android versions, this project seems like it could make Xamarin.Forms much more useful.\n\n**I'm interested in knowing if  anyone has tried using ios-charts in a Xamarin.Forms (or Xamarin.iOS) project.** If so, could you explain how you did this?\n\nThe main problem I'm running that Xamarin seems to be [unable to import Swift frameworks](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/ios/advanced_topics/embedded_frameworks/). For Objective-C frameworks, C# bindings must be written for Xamarin to recognize the classes. I'm unsure whether C# bindings can be written for bridging ObjC headers in a Swift framework.\n\nFor MPAndroidChart, the process is much more straightforward as bindings for .JAR files are [well supported](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/advanced_topics/java_integration_overview/binding-a-java-library/binding-a-jar/).\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\n---\n#### This issue is dedicated for Xamarin support, any info and discussions on this matter should go here\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/606/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/606/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":621397662,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NjIxMzk3NjYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/events/621397662","actor":{"login":"danielgindi","id":366926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjkyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi","html_url":"https://github.com/danielgindi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"b52ca488a4c9ccbea74b36cea5819cc3f97683d8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/commits/b52ca488a4c9ccbea74b36cea5819cc3f97683d8","created_at":"2016-04-10T07:23:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
