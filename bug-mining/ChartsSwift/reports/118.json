This is due to `Compilation Mode` being set to `Whole Module` (rather than `Incremental`) for `Debug` builds:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"928\" alt=\"Xcode build timeline\" src=\"https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/assets/6386506/3a362f43-6942-4f54-952f-a7443775090b\">\r\n\r\nAdding `-Xfrontend -warn-long-expression-type-checking=50` to OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS, which causes the Swift compiler to emit warnings for expressions that take longer than 50ms to type-check, we do see some warnings that indicate Swift is taking a long time to type check some expressions:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"349\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/assets/6386506/9ef275a1-3df4-412b-aa5b-c21e80505285\">\r\n\r\nThese are all in ChartAnimationEasing.swift.  The worst are these offenders:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"762\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/assets/6386506/6d0e9103-46a3-46e6-a94f-b22d7c468db6\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"819\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/assets/6386506/b52e3aa2-e4d7-4862-a070-b0d9721d7a94\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"789\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/assets/6386506/39b1c160-90b6-4740-992c-2d4690464d98\">\r\n\r\nLooking at the other build settings:\r\n\r\n- `Eager Linking` should generally be enabled (`Yes`) to support better parallelization during builds (see WWDC 2022 video: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110364/)\r\n- `Enable Module Verifier` should be `No` for `Debug` builds, as this gets in the way of parallelization during builds also.\r\n- `Compilation Mode` should be `Incremental` for `Debug` builds, but `Whole Module` for `Release`.\r\n\r\n## RECOMMENDATIONS\r\n\r\n1. Set `Eager Linking` build setting to `Yes` for Charts framework target\r\n2. Set `Enable Module Verifier` build setting to `No` for `Debug` builds\r\n3. Set `Compilation Mode` to `Incremental` for `Debug` builds\r\n4. Add `-Xfrontend -warn-long-expression-type-checking=50` (or perhaps use `100`) to OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS so the Swift compiler will emit warnings for expressions that take a long time to type-check.  The number after the `=` is the number of milliseconds threshold, above which warnings will be emitted.\r\n5. Refactor the slow type-checking hotspots identified above.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/5123/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/5123/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
