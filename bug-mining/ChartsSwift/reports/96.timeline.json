`fileprivate` and extension may not contain stored properties.\r\n\r\nI wonder why the code does not use something like this to create a read-only variable:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    open var maxLabelCount = 25\r\n    open var minLabelCount = 2\r\n    open private(set) var labelCount: Int {\r\n        didSet {\r\n            guard minLabelCount <= maxLabelCount else {\r\n                return\r\n

minLabelCount\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nImplementing a read-only variable using a `_variableName` is in my opinion a legacy pattern from the Objective-C days. Using `private(set)` is a much more Swifty solution and moving those hardcoded limits to variables makes it customisable for the end
