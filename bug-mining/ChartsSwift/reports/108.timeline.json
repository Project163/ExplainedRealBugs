I've instantiated BarChartDataSet as\r\n`BarChartDataSet(myArrayOfBarChartDataEntries)`\r\ninstead of the equivalent in the demo project\r\n`BarChartDataSet(values: myArrayOfBarChartDataEntries, label: nil)`\r\nthe former example seemingly utilizing the initializer in ChartDataSet\r\n`\r\n@objc public convenience init(values: [ChartDataEntry]?)\r\n`\r\nand now for whatever reason Xcode 10.2+ seems to be treating the type of value returned as ChartDataSet instead of BarChartDataSet (even though the debugger claims the type to be BarChartDataSet).\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: Just to be clear, forcibly using the intended class initializers (in this case, using values and label as parameter) seems to work just fine.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/comments/486057004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kapisz","id":2817132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTcxMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2817132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz","html_url":"https://github.com/kapisz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2298934462,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQyMjk4OTM0NDYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/events/2298934462","actor":{"login":"liuxuan30","id":4375169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzUxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4375169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30","html_url":"https://github.com/liuxuan30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-25T02:16:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/comments/486496259","html_url":"https://github.com/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/3917#issuecomment-486496259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/3917","id":486496259,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjQ5NjI1OQ==","user":{"login":"liuxuan30","id":4375169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzUxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4375169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30","html_url":"https://github.com/liuxuan30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-25T02:28:11Z","updated_at":"2019-04-25T03:09:20Z","body":"I tried your demo, and it's true indeed.\r\n\r\n@jjatie would you take a look?

I reset my branch to 3.2.2 release, and your demo still the same issue. I didn't have an older Xcode on my side, so I don't know if this is introduced with Xcode 10.2\r\n\r\nBut like what @jjatie said, we can override all super class's designated initializers to make it inherit all superclass's convenient initialziers. \r\n\r\nThis seems never being raised up by anyone, that, the BarChartDataSet overrides one of the designated initializers:\r\n>public override init(entries: [ChartDataEntry]?, label: String?)\r\n\r\nso according to [Automatic Initializer Inheritance](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Initialization.html#ID216), \r\n>Rule 1\r\n    If your subclass doesn’t define any designated initializers, it automatically inherits all of its superclass designated initializers.\r\nRule 2\r\n    If your subclass provides an implementation of all of its superclass designated initializers—either by inheriting them as per rule 1, or by providing a custom implementation as part of its definition—then it automatically inherits all of the superclass convenience initializers.\r\nThese rules apply even if your subclass adds further convenience initializers.\r\nNote\r\nA subclass can implement a superclass designated initializer as a subclass convenience initializer as part of satisfying rule 2.\r\n\r\nthe convenient initializer \r\n>@objc public convenience init(entries: [ChartDataEntry]?)\r\n\r\nis not supposed to be inherited by BarChartDataSet in the first place. So IMO I'm not surprised now it won't work, because BarChartDataSet shouldn't be able to call `init(entries: [ChartDataEntry]?)` at all.\r\n\r\nBut I wonder why until now people start complains about this. If this is really a bug of Xcode or the compiler, I think Xcode 10.2.1 just fixed it, and being able to call `init(entries: [ChartDataEntry]?)` is wrong in previous versions.\r\n\r\nlooking deeper, that we can simply turn `init(label: String?)` in `ChartDataSet` to be a convenient initializer so it can be automatic inherited by all sub `ChartDataSet` classes.\r\n\r\nSo now we able able to call `init(entries: [ChartDataEntry]?)`\r\n\r\nBut the cast failure issue I think is apple's bug. I will file a radar

had to put my thinking cap on and really dig for this one @liuxuan30 , but I do think Xcode broke it rather than fixed it. First and foremost I was wrong, that is, BarChartDataSet(myArrayOfBarChartDataEntries) was never calling `init(values: [ChartDataEntry]?)` in ChartDataSet so this isn't an issue where initializers are available when they shouldn't be given the inheritance rules stated in the link you provided. What it's actually calling is `init<S>(_ elements: S) where S : Sequence, Self.Element == S.Element` of the RangeReplaceableCollection protocol as you discovered earlier, which then calls `init()` that ChartDataSet conforms to and BarChartDataSet inherits from (and populates the 'values' field using the implemented append method of RangeReplaceableCollection). The interesting thing is that while testing with breakpoints, prior to Xcode 10.2 the `public required init()` method in BarChartDataSet was called but since Xcode 10.2, it's the init method in ChartDataSet being called when instantiating with a Sequence as the argument. The unfortunate thing is that because it's instantiating with the conforming class rather than with the intended class when passing a Sequence as argument will cause typecasting to fail elsewhere as well (e.g. Instantiating PieChartData with a PieChartDataSet using a Sequence).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/comments/486934293/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kapisz","id":2817132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTcxMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2817132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz","html_url":"https://github.com/kapisz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapisz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2302123580,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjMwMjEyMzU4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/events/2302123580","actor":{"login":"liuxuan30","id":4375169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzUxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4375169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30","html_url":"https://github.com/liuxuan30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-26T05:49:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2302123581,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzMDIxMjM1ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/events/2302123581","actor":{"login":"liuxuan30","id":4375169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzUxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4375169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30","html_url":"https://github.com/liuxuan30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-26T05:49:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/comments/486937907","html_url":"https://github.com/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/3917#issuecomment-486937907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/3917","id":486937907,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjkzNzkwNw==","user":{"login":"liuxuan30","id":4375169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzUxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4375169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30","html_url":"https://github.com/liuxuan30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-26T06:08:56Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T06:58:05Z","body":"@kapisz yes, that's why I said the cast failure should be a bug of Apple. \r\nif it's calling `init<S>(_ elements: S)`, everything should be fine because we adopted the collection protocols.\r\n\r\nbut it could take a long time to get it really fixed, so I made the change that you could call \r\n>public convenience init(entries: [ChartDataEntry]?)\r\n\r\non your side by just adding an argument label \"entries\". \r\n\r\nWhat I mean \"but I think Xcode fix it\" is that, I don't remember if old Swift allows to automatically omit the argument label if there is only one parameter without `_` being specified. ~~But to my knowledge, `let set = BarChartDataSet(values)` should never work in any previous versions before we adopt collection protocol, because this initializer is not inherited at all~~. I just wonder why this is revealed until now. So if you were able to call it and get a valid set, I think it was a mistake back then.\r\n\r\n@kapisz can you check on your side, if you have old Xcode and say Charts 3.2.2 or even older, that you can actually get a return of `let set = BarChartDataSet(values)` ?
