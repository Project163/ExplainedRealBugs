It's quite interesting, since I never crashed like this on my side. And a few people are having the same issue here. That's what we need to dig deeper, and find out the difference. My app needs to support iOS 7, so I simply drag all the swift files into my project and start from there. Are you using the framework directly? Will this matter?\n\nI have tried with ChartsDemo, remove reference for charts.xcproject, and drag it back, on iOS simulator 9 and iPhone 6 plus model, nothing crashes for combined chart, debug

got this error message from console:\n\n```\nCharts was compiled with optimization - stepping may behave oddly; variables may not be available.\n```\n\nLooks like it has something to do with the

_fillFormatter = format\n```\n\ncan clean the crash is that the compiler optimized in another way and avoid the crash.\n\nSo either use the files or add above code to workaround it. @danielgindi would
