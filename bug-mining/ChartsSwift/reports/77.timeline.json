Set it to true and your bars are not cut in half.\n\n_However_, there’s a new problem, at least on my chart: the last bar is entirely missing. I think the problem is in `BarChartView.calcMinMax()`, which contains:\n\n> ```\n>     if fitBars\n>     {\n>         _xAxis.calculate(\n>             min: data.xMin - data.barWidth / 2.0,\n>             max: data.xMax - data.barWidth / 2.0)\n>     }\n> ```\n\nI think the second (max) calculation should read `max: data.xMax + data.barWidth /
