In Java, you can create a subclass of a chart renderer and take advantage of internal/protected methods & properties to create a custom chart renderer. This does not appear to be the case with the Swift module.\n\nI was trying to create a bar chart with rounded corners on the bars. I needed to subclass BarChartRenderer, but was unable to do so without moving the ios-charts source code into my app's module.\n\nIs there a way to accomplish a similar level of API-parity with the Java counterpart while at the same time allowing for extensibility? Perhaps take advantage of protocols or something.\n","closed_by":{"login":"danielgindi","id":366926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjkyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi","html_url":"https://github.com/danielgindi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/357/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
