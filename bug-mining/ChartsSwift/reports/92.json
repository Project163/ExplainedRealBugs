Here is the code that I use:\r\n\r\n```\r\npieChart.data = PieChartData(dataSets: [\r\n    PieChartDataSet(values: [PieChartDataEntry(value: 30)], label: \"Foo\"),\r\n    PieChartDataSet(values: [PieChartDataEntry(value: 70)], label: \"Bar\")\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I do that, I get this error: `fatal error: unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value`.\r\n\r\nIt seems to happen [here](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/blob/a540403f0d531f29ce01007dbccf2d6a26ad8253/Source/Charts/Renderers/LegendRenderer.swift#L47), on the second iteration, when `i` equals `1`.\r\n\r\nI reproduced it in an example project that can be found [here](https://github.com/aubm/My-iOS-Charts).\r\n\r\nCheers!","closed_by":{"login":"liuxuan30","id":4375169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzUxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4375169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30","html_url":"https://github.com/liuxuan30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/2099/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/2099/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
