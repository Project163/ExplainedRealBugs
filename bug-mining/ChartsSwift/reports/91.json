The data is set on the chart before auto layout engine has had a chance to layout the view.  The view effectively has CGRect.zero for its frame.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the view port jobs are ran [before](https://github.com/danielgindi/Charts/blob/5288c2500c56d18e2a166b6783cee2626e522354/Source/Charts/Charts/ChartViewBase.swift#L916) `notifyDataSetChanged()`.
