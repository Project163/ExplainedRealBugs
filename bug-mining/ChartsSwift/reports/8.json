I am confused why the left one is smaller than right one. I just feed the same frame for both of them, only data is different. What I want is the same size for radar chart.\n\nI found that `_viewPortHandler.contentRect` is giving different rect at diffrent phase. In init function, `_viewPortHandler.contentRect` is giving the right size.\n\nI disabled the legend like this:\n\n``` swift\nself.radarChart.legend.enabled = NO;\nself.radarChart.data = radarData; // after set legend disabled\n```\n\nand checking stack trace, it shows the stack is notifyDataSetChanged() ->  calculateOffsets(),\n\nin calculateOffsets(), \n\n``` swift\n        legendTop += self.extraTopOffset;\n        legendRight += self.extraRightOffset;\n        legendBottom += self.extraBottomOffset;\n        legendLeft += self.extraLeftOffset;\n\n        var minOffset = CGFloat(10.0);\n\n        if (self.isKindOfClass(RadarChartView))\n        {\n            let x = (self as! RadarChartView).xAxis;\n\n            if (x.isEnabled)\n            {\n                minOffset = max(10.0, x.labelWidth);\n            }\n        }\n        var offsetLeft = max(minOffset, legendLeft);\n        var offsetTop = max(minOffset, legendTop);\n        var offsetRight = max(minOffset, legendRight);\n        var offsetBottom = max(minOffset, max(self.requiredBaseOffset, legendBottom));\n\n        _viewPortHandler.restrainViewPort(offsetLeft: offsetLeft, offsetTop: offsetTop, offsetRight: offsetRight, offsetBottom: offsetBottom);\n```\n\nthe minOffset depends on the xAxis label width, the left radar is 11.56 whilte the right radar is 40. then it leads to diffrent size and even the factor is somewhat weird.\n\n``` swift\n    /// Returns the factor that is needed to transform values into pixels.\n    public var factor: CGFloat\n    {\n        var content = _viewPortHandler.contentRect;\n        return min(content.width / 2.0, content.height / 2.0)\n                / CGFloat(_yAxis.axisRange);\n    }\n```\n\nThe factor depends on the axisRange as well, and my left radar range is 120.0 while the left one is 140000000.0.\n\nI am not sure if this a bug. but if false, how can I fix it? I need the left one and right one is equal radius.\n","closed_by":{"login":"danielgindi","id":366926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjkyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi","html_url":"https://github.com/danielgindi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
