I found out where these errors are coming from.\n\nThese errors are generated when my LineChartView try to draw the highlight bar after I set its position manually.\n\nIn my code I used to position the highlight bar on the highest value in the chart right after setting up the LineChartData in my LineChartView.\n\nBut with Charts 3.0 the highlight bar doesn't draw at all, after I set its position with\n`self.chartView.highlightValue(x: Double, dataSetIndex: Int, callDelegate: Bool)`\n\nI succeed to reproduce this errors in the demo by adding this line \n`[_chartView highlightValueWithX:0.0 dataSetIndex:0 callDelegate:true];`\nat the end of the function \n`- (void)setDataCount:(int)count range:(double)range`\nin the LineChart1ViewController example.\n\nShould I open another issue for this ? or am I doing something wrong here ?\nI will investigate further to see if I can localize where the issue come from and maybe submit a PR with the correction.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/comments/252476304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"StevenMasini","id":1907562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDc1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1907562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini","html_url":"https://github.com/StevenMasini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":817311617,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODE3MzExNjE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/events/817311617","actor":{"login":"danielgindi","id":366926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjkyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi","html_url":"https://github.com/danielgindi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-09T09:44:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":817311618,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDgxNzMxMTYxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/events/817311618","actor":{"login":"danielgindi","id":366926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjkyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi","html_url":"https://github.com/danielgindi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-09T09:44:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/comments/252483279","html_url":"https://github.com/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/1626#issuecomment-252483279","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/1626","id":252483279,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjQ4MzI3OQ==","user":{"login":"danielgindi","id":366926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjkyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/366926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi","html_url":"https://github.com/danielgindi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danielgindi/received_events","type":"User","us

In my own project I succeed to bypass this issue by giving the `y` value to `open func highlightValue(x: Double, y: Double, dataSetIndex: Int, callDelegate: Bool)`.\n\nThe solution would be to retrieve the `y` value automatically. I could help with this issue if you want to ? I can correct it in my own branch and submit a pull request.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/comments/257228059/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"StevenMasini","id":1907562,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDc1NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1907562?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini","html_url":"https://github.com/StevenMasini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StevenMasini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":841525093,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODQxNTI1MDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/events/841525093","actor":{"login":"liuxuan30","id":4375169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzUxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4375169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30","html_url":"https://github.com/liuxuan30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-31T07:19:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":841525094,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDg0MTUyNTA5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/events/841525094","actor":{"login":"liuxuan30","id":4375169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzUxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4375169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30","html_url":"https://github.com/liuxuan30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-31T07:19:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":841549180,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQ4NDE1NDkxODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChartsOrg/Charts/issues/events/841549180","actor":{"login":"liuxuan30","id":4375169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzUxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4375169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30","html_url":"https://github.com/liuxuan30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuxuan30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-31T07:54:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Cha
