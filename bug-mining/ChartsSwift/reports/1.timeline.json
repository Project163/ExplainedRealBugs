I used version 2.1.4 up until today and decided to upgrade since there are features I'd like to use in 2.2.3. But now my animations are causing really weird behaviour. For some data it animates as expected, but for other data (I can't seem to find a pattern) it also animates correctly, but fills and unfills the background of the ChartView. Imagine taking the fill bucket in Photoshop and clicking in an empty square, that's what's happening visually.\n\nIf I don't animate everything works fine. Some ChartEasingOption is more messed up than others, but I really need to get this animation to work. There has been some changes to the way you structure data and colors in 2.2.3 compared to 2.1.4, but it doesn't feel like I've done anything wrong.\n\nI call my functions in this
