went through our migrations one by one and managed to distill some sort of example to replicate the issue.\r\n\r\nAssume we have the following SQL schema dump file:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE partners (\r\n  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,\r\n  support_priority INTEGER DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL,\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we have the following 2 migrations to run on top of that file:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSchema::table('partners', function (Blueprint $table) {\r\n    $table->unsignedSmallInteger('partner_type')->nullable();\r\n});\r\n\r\nSchema::table('partners', function (Blueprint $table) {\r\n    $table->unsignedSmallInteger('partner_type')->default(0)->change();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen running the second alter table statement Laravel 11 will execute the following queries:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ncreate table \"__temp__partners\" (\r\n  \"id\" integer primary key autoincrement not null,\r\n  \"support_priority\" integer not null,\r\n  \"partner_type\" integer not null default '0'\r\n);\r\n\r\ndrop table \"partners\";\r\n\r\nalter table\r\n  \"__temp__partners\" rename to \"partners\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNote how support_priority is now just `not null` somehow without any default.\r\n\r\nAfter I manually replaced default 0 with default '0' in schema dump it generated a correct query.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ncreate table \"__temp__partners\" (\r\n  \"id\" integer primary key autoincrement not null,\r\n  \"support_priority\" integer not null default '0',\r\n  \"partner_type\" integer not null default '0'\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not like this \"fix\", because it will be overridden each time I recreate SQL dump meaning I will need to manually change all of these again.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2156036990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adiachenko","id":10194667,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTk0NjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10194667?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiachenko","html_url":"https://github.com/adiachenko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiachenko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiachenko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiachenko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiachenko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiachenko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiachenko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiachenko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiachenko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiachenko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2156038023","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/51747#issuecomment-2156038023","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/51747","id":2156038023,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHMwOs6AgoeH","user":{"login":"staudenmeir","id":1853169,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTMxNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853169?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/staudenmeir","html_url":"https://github.com/staudenmeir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staudenmeir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staudenmeir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staudenmeir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staudenmeir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staudenmeir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staudenmeir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staudenmeir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staudenmeir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/staudenmeir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-08T13:30:07Z","updated_at":"2024-06-08T13:30:07Z","body":"/cc

#51747 \r\n\r\nModifying a column on a table that has another column with `default 0` was causing the default expression to be dropped, this PR fixes that.\r\n\r\nThis happens only when the table has a column with `default 0` as `->default(new Expression('0'))` and not `->default(0)` that compiles as `default '0'`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/51803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/51803/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2167121833","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/51747#issuecomment-2167121833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/51747","id":2167121833,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHMwOs6BK6ep","user":{"login":"hafezdivandari","id":56585913,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTg1OTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56585913?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hafezdivandari","html_url":"https://github.com/hafezdivandari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hafezdivandari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hafezdivandari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hafezdivandari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hafezdivandari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hafezdivandari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hafezdivandari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hafezdivandari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hafezdivandari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hafezdivandari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-14T02:58:26Z","updated_at":"2024-06-14T02:58:26Z","body":"You
