(Thank you for that!) \r\n\r\nDuring the release of the 11.35, a new `functions.php` file was added with the `enum_value` function in it. That function depends on the `transform` function in `illuminate/support` which isn't a dependency of `illuminate/collections`. This leads to this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function Illuminate\\Support\\transform() in /home/runner/.composer/vendor/illuminate/collections/functions.php:20\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the fix is here because `illuminate/support` has a dependency on `illuminate/collections` which would make it a cyclical dependency if we add `illuminate/support` as a dependency. It might be wroth trying to implement `enum_value` without using `transform`.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nYou can view the issue if you do a standalone install of `illuminate/collections` and navigate to `functions.php` in your IDE. You can see there's no definition for `transform`.","closed_by":{"login":"taylorotwell","id":463230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzIzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/463230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell","html_url":"https://github.com/taylorotwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/53867/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/53867/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
