But for plural words, it doesn't work anymore, giving the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nObject of class App\\Enums\\YourEnumHere could not be converted to string\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### ⚠️ See the \"Steps To Reproduce\" section below for more details.\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution\r\nDo not implicitly resolve backed enums when there is a custom route binding.\r\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Create a backed enum\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nnamespace App\\Enums;\r\n\r\nenum Fruit:string\r\n{\r\n    case APPLE = 'apple';\r\n    case BANANA = 'banana';\r\n    case PEAR = 'pear';\r\n\r\n    public static function fromPlural(string $plural): self\r\n    {\r\n        return match ($plural) {\r\n            'apples' => self::APPLE,\r\n            'bananas' => self::BANANA,\r\n            'pears' => self::PEAR,\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Add custom route binding to the AppServiceProvider.php\r\n```php\r\nRoute::bind('fruits', fn(string $x) => Fruit::fromPlural($x));\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Add a route to the web.php file\r\n```php\r\nRoute::get('shop/get/{fruit}/{id}', function (App\\Enums\\Fruit $fruit, string $id) {\r\n    dd($fruit, $id); // IT WORKS!!!\r\n});\r\n\r\nRoute::get('shop/list/{fruits}', function (App\\Enums\\Fruit $fruits) {\r\n    dd($fruits); // ERROR: Object of class App\\Enums\\Fruit could not be converted to string\r\n});\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"taylorotwell","id":463230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzIzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/463230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell","html_url":"https://github.com/taylorotwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/51514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/51514/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
