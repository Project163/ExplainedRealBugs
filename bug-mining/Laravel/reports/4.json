Specifically line 1010 within the `makePromise` method of `Illuminate/Http/Client/PendingRequest`.\r\n\r\nIn some situations, the exception that is thrown is not a `TransferException`, but an `OutOfBoundsException`. It may be preferable to remove the type hint.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nWhen using the Http Client to send concurrent requests e.g.\r\n\r\n```php\r\nHttp::pool(fn (Pool $pool) => [\r\n    $pool->get('http://localhost/first'),\r\n    $pool->get('http://localhost/second'),\r\n    $pool->get('http://localhost/third'),\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd writing a test that fakes a corresponding Http response sequence e.g.\r\n\r\n```php\r\nuse Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Http;\r\n\r\nHttp::fakeSequence()\r\n    ->push(null, 401)\r\n    ->push(null, 403) \r\n    ->push(null, 405);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following exception is thrown:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nTypeError: Illuminate\\Http\\Client\\PendingRequest::Illuminate\\Http\\Client\\{closure}(): Argument #1 ($e) must be of type GuzzleHttp\\Exception\\TransferException, OutOfBoundsException given, called in /vendor/guzzlehttp/promises/src/RejectedPromise.php on line 49\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error relates to the `TransferException` type hint within `Illuminate/Http/Client/PendingRequest` on line 1010. If the type hint is removed the test runs as expected.\r\n\r\nThis error is not present when sending requests separately (not concurrently) as promises are not used.","closed_by":{"login":"mattkingshott","id":51963402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxOTYzNDAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51963402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattkingshott","html_url":"https://github.com/mattkingshott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattkingshott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattkingshott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattkingshott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattkingshott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattkingshott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattkingshott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattkingshott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattkingshott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattkingshott/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/48938/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/48938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
