Changed\r\n\r\n- In https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/54606, the `artisan serve` command was changed to require a `--no-reload` flag when using the `PHP_CLI_WORKER_SERVERS`. Instead of ignoring the config (which is the default in [Laravel's scaffold](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/12.x/.env.example#L14)), we can wait for the port to become available (for a few seconds) and throw an exception if it doesn't (clearly something went wrong and we can't recover)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelated PRs:\r\n- https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/54606\r\n\r\n**Context:**\r\n\r\nAs I was working on the [Hotreload package](https://github.com/hotwired-laravel/hotreload), I noticed the processes were getting stuck by the SSE endpoint. Turns out there was only 1 process, even though we set the `PHP_CLI_WORKER_SERVERS` in the [default Laravel env](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/12.x/.env.example#L14).\r\n\r\nThe current way it's working right now, we're ignoring the desired number of processes configured. With the changes here, we'd respect that but disable the auto-reload behavior. This is important for the Hotreload package, but also for [Sail](https://github.com/laravel/sail/blob/1.x/runtimes/8.4/Dockerfile#L14), since the `--no-reload` flag is not being used in the default command there.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/54972/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/54972/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
