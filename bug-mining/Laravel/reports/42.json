Create table `users` with column `created_at`  if not present\n2. set `APP_DEBUG=true` in `.env`\n3. create endpoint with code\n```\n$router->get('binding_problems', function () {\nDB::table('users')\n        ->select('*')\n        ->where('created_at',  '>', new \\DateTimeImmutable())\n        ->get()\n        ->all();\n    throw new \\Exception('We should see Laravel 11 error page, but we see Symfony Exception page');\n});\n```\n4. query that endpoint (e.g. `localhost/binding_problems`)\n\nExpected: \"new\" Laravel page should be rendered  (with list of Database queries containing one query)\nActual: \"old\" Symfony error page is rendered","closed_by":{"login":"crynobone","id":172966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjk2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone","html_url":"https://github.com/crynobone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/56639/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/56639/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
