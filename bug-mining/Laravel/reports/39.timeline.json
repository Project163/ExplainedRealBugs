think accepting an `array` with a Multipart request might just be assuming you are sending your own like this:\n\n```php\nHttp::attach(\n    'attachment', file_get_contents('photo.jpg'), 'photo.jpg', ['Content-Type' => 'image/jpeg']\n)->post('http://example.com/users', [\n    [\n        'name' => 'name',\n        'contents' => 'Steve',\n    ],\n    [\n        'name' =>  'roles[]',\n        'contents' => 'Network Administrator',    \n    ],\n    [\n        'name' =>  'roles[]',\n        'contents' => 'Janitor',    \n    ],\n]);\n```\n\nSo it's probably not safe to try and do anything clever in `parseMultipartBodyFormat()` to handle it.\n\nhttps://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/request-options.html#multipart\n\nBut it also looks like `parseHttpOptions` supports `Arrayable` [classes](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/12.x/src/Illuminate/Http/Client/PendingRequest.php#L998), so in theory you could create your own class to pass in there and supply the data in the right format depending on whether it's `multipart` or not.\n\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2901170845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Muffinman","id":1319568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTk1Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1319568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Muffinman","html_url":"https://github.com/Muffinman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Muffinman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Muffinman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Muffinman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Muffinman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Muffinman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Muffinman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Muffinman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Muffinman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Muffinman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2901222225","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/55732#issuecomment-2901222225","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/55732","id":2901222225,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHMwOs6s7SNR","user":{"login":"tobia","id":48756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobia","html_url":"https://github.com/tobia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-22T13:25:07Z","updated_at":"2025-05-22T13:32:52Z","body":"@Muffinman It was not clear to me, by looking at the [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/http-client), that I could pass a numeric array of associative arrays, each with name and contents. I thought the second argument to post() had to be an associative array of `[$name => $contents]` pairs.\n\nEdit: I just checked, the numeric array of associative arrays only works when issuing a multipart request. In the other case `asForm()` I still need to send an \"array value,\" as in: `'roles' => ['Network Administrator', 'Janitor']` So I still think that the \"array value\" should be better supported by the multipart implementation, as well as documenting that the user can pass a different format (numeric array of associative arrays) and what keys are supported in the latter case.\n\nBut at least now there is a clear workaround on how to issue multipart POST requests with array fields.

Description\r\nFixes an issue where the HTTP client would throw `InvalidArgumentException: A 'contents' key is required.` when sending multipart/form-data requests containing both file attachments and array values (e.g., checkbox selections).\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe `parseMultipartBodyFormat` method in `PendingRequest` was unable to handle array values correctly when formatting multipart data. Array values like `['Network Administrator', 'Janitor']` would be passed through as-is instead of being converted to the proper multipart format.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n- Changed `map()` to `flatMap()` to properly expand array values\r\n- Array values are now formatted as individual `field[]` entries for each value\r\n- Maintains backward compatibility with existing `name`/`contents` format\r\n- Added comprehensive tests for the new functionality\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- **Core Fix**: Updated `parseMultipartBodyFormat()` method in `PendingRequest.php`\r\n- **Tests**: Added test cases for array values and mixed file+array scenarios\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- ✅ Array values are correctly formatted as `field[]` entries\r\n- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for existing multipart format\r\n- ✅ File uploads with array values work without exceptions\r\n- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\n```php\r\n// This now works without throwing exceptions\r\nHttp::attach('attachment', file_get_contents('photo.jpg'), 'photo.jpg')\r\n    ->post('http://example.com/users', [\r\n        'name' => 'Steve',\r\n        'roles' => ['Network Administrator', 'Janitor'], // Array values\r\n    ]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes
