trying to draft a pull request I ran into the following.\r\n\r\nI delved a little deeper into it and it looks like the issue lies in `operatorForWhere`. `value` calls `firstWhere` with only 1 argument (the key, and no value) which ultimately uses `operatorForWhere`, also with 1 argument. When `operatorForWhere` is called with just 1 argument it tries to search for any truthy value.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/e7b12ff811e4955224d292962d2f369627c6a47b/src/Illuminate/Collections/Traits/EnumeratesValues.php#L1082-L1086\r\n\r\nThe closure that `operatorForWhere` returns checks whether the retrieved value and the comparison value differ in being objects. If it does, a simple truth check occurs whether the requested operation is an inequality.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/e7b12ff811e4955224d292962d2f369627c6a47b/src/Illuminate/Collections/Traits/EnumeratesValues.php#L1101-L1103\r\n\r\nEnums are objects, `true` is not, so this check will return false. We could change this check to exclude enums:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nif (count($strings) < 2 && count(array_filter([$retrieved, $value], function ($v) {\r\n    return is_object($v) && ! $v instanceof UnitEnum;\r\n})) == 1) {\r\n    return in_array($operator, ['!=', '<>', '!==']);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, we run into a strange issue now. `operatorForWhere` now returns the result of `$retrieved == $value`. `$retrieved` is our enum, `$value` is `true`. The result of this comparison is `false`! This might actually be a bug in PHP (see: https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/16954).\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to proceed from here?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2503342044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CasEbb","id":617080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNzA4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/617080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CasEbb","html_url":"https://github.com/CasEbb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CasEbb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CasEbb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CasEbb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CasEbb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CasEbb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CasEbb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CasEbb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CasEbb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CasEbb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2514350803","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/53676#issuecomment-2514350803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/53676","id":2514350803,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHMwOs6V3fLT","user":{"login":"joelbladt","id":34725327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI1MzI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34725327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelbladt","html_url":"https://github.com/joelbladt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelbladt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelbladt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelbladt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelbladt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelbladt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelbladt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelbladt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelbladt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joelbladt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-03T11:57:32Z","updated_at":"2024-12-03T11:57:32Z","body":"If I have understood correctly, you want to receive all results from the collection as an array and the enums should not be skipped.
