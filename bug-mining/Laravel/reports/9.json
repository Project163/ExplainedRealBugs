Laravel Version\n\n10.47.0\n\n### PHP Version\n\n8.2.16\n\n### Database Driver & Version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\npassing a single Address object into Envelope causes two Address objects being created, with the second having the name as the email address and causing a malformed email address error\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nReproduced in Tinkerwell\r\n\r\nCreating an Address object\r\n```\r\n$to = new Address(\"peter@dragon.co.uk\", \"Peter Jones\");\r\n```\r\nresults in\r\n```\r\nIlluminate\\Mail\\Mailables\\Address {#1383\r\n    +address: \"peter@dragon.co.uk\",\r\n    +name: \"Peter Jones\",\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nA seemingly correct Address object with address and name correctly assigned\r\n\r\nHowever, pass this object into the envelope;\r\n```\r\n$to = new Address(\"peter@dragon.co.uk\", \"Peter Jones\");\r\n\r\n$en = new Envelope(to: $to);\r\n```\r\nresults in the two properties of Address to be turned into two separate Address objects\r\n```\r\nIlluminate\\Mail\\Mailables\\Envelope {#4873\r\n    +from: null,\r\n    +to: [\r\n      \"address\" => Illuminate\\Mail\\Mailables\\Address {#4399\r\n        +address: \"peter@dragon.co.uk\",\r\n        +name: null,\r\n      },\r\n      \"name\" => Illuminate\\Mail\\Mailables\\Address {#3631\r\n        +address: \"Peter Jones\",\r\n        +name: null,\r\n      },\r\n    ],\r\n    +cc: [],\r\n    +bcc: [],\r\n    +replyTo: [],\r\n    +subject: null,\r\n    +tags: [],\r\n    +metadata: [],\r\n    +using: [],\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nI suspect this could be a quite common issue, but with devs finding some alternate syntax that works for them, such as wrapping the address in an array;\r\n\r\n```\r\n$en = new Envelope(to: [$to]);\r\n```\r\ncorrectly gives\r\n```\r\nIlluminate\\Mail\\Mailables\\Envelope {#4469\r\n    +from: null,\r\n    +to: [\r\n      Illuminate\\Mail\\Mailables\\Address {#1619\r\n        +address: \"peter@dragon.co.uk\",\r\n        +name: \"Peter Jones\",\r\n      },\r\n    ],\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"crynobone","id":172966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjk2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone","html_url":"https://github.com/crynobone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/50430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/50430/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
