PostgreSQL GiST operator class support for spatial indexes\r\n\r\nFixes #56261\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nPostgreSQL GiST indexes require an operator class for certain data types like `inet`. Currently, Laravel's `spatialIndex()` method doesn't support specifying operator classes, causing errors like:\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nThis PR adds support for specifying operator classes in spatial indexes while maintaining backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Add `operatorClass` parameter to `Blueprint::spatialIndex()` method\r\n- Add operator class support to `IndexDefinition` \r\n- Implement operator class handling in `PostgresGrammar`\r\n- Add test case for spatial index with operator class\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n```php\r\n// Before (fails for inet type)\r\n$table->spatialIndex(['client_internet'], 'idx_name');\r\n\r\n// After (works with operator class)\r\n$table->spatialIndex(['client_internet'], 'idx_name', 'inet_ops');\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Generated SQL\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE INDEX idx_name ON table USING gist (client_internet inet_ops)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Backward Compatibility\r\nThe `operatorClass` parameter is optional, so existing code continues to work unchanged.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Added test case in `DatabasePostgresSchemaGrammarTest.php`\r\n- Verified with PostgreSQL 17.5\r\n- Confirmed backward compatibility with existing spatial indexes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/56277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/56277/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/3067738477","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/56261#issuecomment-3067738477","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/56261","id":3067738477,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHMwOs622flt","user":{"login":"joteejotee","id":85487037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NDg3MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85487037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joteejotee","html_url":"https://github.com/joteejotee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joteejotee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joteejotee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joteejotee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joteejotee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joteejotee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joteejotee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joteejotee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joteejotee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joteejotee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-14T03:49:27Z","updated_at":"2025-07-14T03:49:27Z","body":"Many

PR adds support for specifying operator classes when creating spatial indexes on PostgreSQL, addressing issue #56261.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nPostgreSQL GiST indexes require explicit operator classes for certain data types (like `inet`). Currently, Laravel's `spatialIndex()` method doesn't support specifying operator classes, causing migrations to fail with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: data type inet has no default operator class for access method \"gist\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nAdd an optional `$operatorClass` parameter to `Blueprint::spatialIndex()`:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// Before (fails for inet)\r\n$table->spatialIndex(['coordinates']);\r\n\r\n// After (works with operator class)\r\n$table->spatialIndex(['coordinates'], 'my_index', 'point_ops');\r\n$table->spatialIndex(['client_internet'], 'inet_idx', 'inet_ops');\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Add optional `$operatorClass` parameter to `Blueprint::spatialIndex()`\r\n- Update `PostgresGrammar::compileSpatialIndex()` to handle operator classes\r\n- Add comprehensive tests for the new functionality\r\n- Maintain full backward compatibility\r\n\r\nFixes
