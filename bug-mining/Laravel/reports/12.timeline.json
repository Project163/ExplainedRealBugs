The PHP end tag `?>` [gobbles up the following newline](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.instruction-separation.php). To prevent this, Blade looks if the expression is followed by a newline, and [injects two newlines after the PHP end tag](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/6da5093aa672d26d0357b3569d8b3b426673dc61/src/Illuminate/View/Compilers/Concerns/CompilesEchos.php#L94). One is gobbled up by PHP, the other one is the original.\r\n\r\nWith `@verbatim`, the verbatim block is [first replaced by a placeholder](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/6da5093aa672d26d0357b3569d8b3b426673dc61/src/Illuminate/View/Compilers/BladeCompiler.php#L391-L396). Because the whole block including newlines is replaced by a fixed string, the `{{ 1 }}` expression is no longer followed by a newline. The compiler doesn't detect the newline and doesn't double it, so in the end result the newline is gobbled up by the PHP closing tag.\r\n\r\nOne way to solve this is to leave newlines alone in the input and always add a newline after a PHP closing tag, regardless of whether it is followed by a newline in the input.\r\n\r\nE.g. \r\n\r\n```\r\nprotected function compileRegularEchos($value)\r\n{\r\n    $pattern = sprintf('/(@)?%s\\s*(.+?)\\s*%s/s', $this->contentTags[0], $this->contentTags[1]);\r\n\r\n    $callback = function ($matches) {\r\n        $wrapped = sprintf($this->echoFormat, $this->wrapInEchoHandler($matches[2]));\r\n\r\n        return $matches[1] ? substr($matches[0], 1) : \"<?php echo {$wrapped}; ?>\\n\";\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return preg_replace_callback($pattern, $callback, $value);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA workaround to get one newline is to put `@verbatim` on the same line as `second line`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfirst line\r\n{{ 1 }}\r\n@verbatimsecond line\r\n@endverbatim\r\nfinal line\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this is also unexpected, because there is no separator between `@verbatim` and `second`. This would not work for any other directive than verbatim.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2067987796/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Sjord","id":113030,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzAzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/113030?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sjord","html_url":"https://github.com/Sjord","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sjord/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sjord/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sjord/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sjord/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sjord/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sjord/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sjord/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sjord/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Sjord/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12555147673,"node_id":"LE_lADOAHMwOs6GY-yHzwAAAALsWFmZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/events/12555147673","actor":{"login":"driesvints","id":594614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDYxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/594614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/driesvints","html_url":"https://github.com/driesvints","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driesvints/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driesvints/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driesvints/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driesvints/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driesvints/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driesvints/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driesvints/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driesvints/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/driesvints/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-04-22T07:22:07Z","label":{"name":"help wanted","color":"008672"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2068666504","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/51146#issuecomment-2068666504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/51146","id":2068666504,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHMwOs57TViI","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-04-22T07:22:18Z","updated_at":"2024-04-22T07:22:18Z","body":"Thank you for reporting this issue!\n\nAs Laravel is an open source project, we rely on the community to help us diagnose and fix issues as it is not possible to research and fix every issue reported to us via GitHub.\n\nIf possible, please make a pull request fixing the issue you have described, along with corresponding tests.

#51146\r\n\r\nIf a PHP end tag `?>` is followed by a newline, that newline is not shown in the output. To counteract this, CompilesEchos detects whether an echo is followed by a newline and then doubles that newline. However, if the newline is part of a verbatim block, it is already replaced by a placeholder and CompilesEchos won't detect it correctly.\r\n\r\nThis change moves the whitespace in front of the verbatim block. The whitespace remains outside of the placeholder and CompilesEchos can correctly detect it.\r\n\r\nThis assumes that whitespace is not modified by Blade in a manner that it would be necessary to put whitespace in a verbatim block to change its meaning.\r\n\r\nOnly the final assertion in the testNewlinesAreInsertedCorrectlyAfterEcho test actually tests for what we want. The first two are more of an introduction for the reader, to show that what we test in the last assertion really makes sense. It first tests a verbatim block, then an echo statement, and then the combination of the two, what is what we are really interested in.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease only send a pull request to branches that are currently supported: https://laravel.com/docs/releases#support-policy \r\n\r\nIf you are unsure which branch your pull request should be sent to, please read: https://laravel.com/docs/contributions#which-branch\r\n\r\nPull requests without a descriptive title, thorough description, or tests will be closed.\r\n\r\nIn addition, please describe the benefit to end users;
