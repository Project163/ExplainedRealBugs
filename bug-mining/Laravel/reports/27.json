The ``HasFactory`` trait calls ``guessModelNamesUsing`` in the ``Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Factories\\Factory``, which sets a static property that then applies to all classes that inherit ``Factory``. \n\nThe bug ultimately originates from the model name resolver being set in the [Factory class](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/17786ca25fa9080f0b4f03af7517e9fc72fa0b4a/src/Illuminate/Database/Eloquent/Factories/Factory.php#L838). It's setting the ``$modelNameResolver`` property for ``Factory`` and every class that inherits ``Factory``. \n\n## Possible Solutions\n\n1. Change the ``$modelNameResolver`` property in ``src\\Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Factories\\Factory.php`` to an array, which holds a implemented factory class name with a resolver:\n\n```php\nprotected static $modelNameResolver = [];\n\n// ...\n\npublic function modelName()\n{\n  // ...\n  $resolver = static::$modelNameResolver[static::class] ?? function (self $factory) {\n    // ...\n  };\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ...\n\npublic static function guessModelNamesUsing(callable $callback)\n{\n  static::$modelNameResolver[static::class] = $callback;\n}\n```\n\n2. Require the ``UseFactory`` attribute set for all or none of the models. This would mean updating the documentation.\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nThe repository is located at: https://github.com/SameOldNick/laravel-factory-bug\n\n#### Install Steps\n \n1. Clone the repo: ``git clone https://github.com/SameOldNick/laravel-factory-bug``\n2. Install Composer packages: ``composer install``\n3. Create .env file: ``cp .env.example .env``\n4. Run PHPUnit test case: ``php artisan test --filter=BugTest``\n\n#### Copy of Problem Code\n\nFor the record, I've included the problem code. The ``Role`` class has the ``UseFactory`` attribute set, while the ``User`` class doesn't.\n\n```php\n// Works fine\nRole::factory(5)->create();\n\n// Will try insert into roles table\nUser::factory()->create([\n  'name' => 'Test User',\n  'email' => 'test@example.com',\n]);\n```","closed_by":{"login":"crynobone","id":172966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjk2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone","html_url":"https://github.com/crynobone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/54642/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/54642/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
