Set `PHP_CLI_SERVER_WORKERS=5` env var\n2. Start the development server with `php artisan serve --no-reload --host=0.0.0.0`\n3. For e.g make a call to own internal api like this:\n\n```php\npublic function index(Request $request){\n    $appUrl = env('APP_URL');\n    // or with token what ever...\n    $con =  Http::withHeaders([\n        'Accept' => 'application/json',\n        'Referer' => $appUrl,\n        'Cookie' => request()->header('Cookie'),\n        'X-CSRF-TOKEN' => csrf_token(),\n    ])->baseUrl(\"$appUrl/api\");\n    $response = $con->get('/users/', []);\n \n    // curl hangs with 30 sec timeout, as the api request cannot be processed in parallel\n\n    return view('users.index', ['data'=>$response->object()]);\n}\n```\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/283ae9a5-e007-41bb-bff5-d6865552e0e0)\n","closed_by":{"login":"taylorotwell","id":463230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzIzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/463230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell","html_url":"https://github.com/taylorotwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/54723/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/54723/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
