While you might (or might not) be right about the usefulness of certain traits, the functionality in question has its reasons why it belongs to the `\\Illuminate\\Http\\Resources` namespace: Because that's where resources live. This is not Eloquent functionality. In other words: For a model to be transformed to a resource, the code in this place needs to know about both Eloquent logic and resource logic. If we turned that around, the trait would be missing Eloquent functionality.

no one questions the logic here. You are right.\n\nThe only thing is that the framework forces the user to use those traits even if they are not used in fact, while using the full framework or only Eloquent alone.\n\nFor example, from all the traits the model uses:\n\n  use Concerns\\HasAttributes,\n      Concerns\\HasEvents,\n      Concerns\\HasGlobalScopes,\n      Concerns\\HasRelationships, //  this we had to overwrite so we can solve this [vulnerability/bug](https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/51825)\n      Concerns\\HasTimestamps, // this we overwrite with date time not timestamps\n      Concerns\\HasUniqueIds,\n      Concerns\\HidesAttributes,\n      Concerns\\GuardsAttributes,\n      Concerns\\PreventsCircularRecursion,\n      ForwardsCalls,\n      TransformsToResource; // this we don't use because we don't use resources\n  /** @use HasCollection<\\Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Collection<array-key, static & self>> */\n  use HasCollection;\n\nIn version 8 they were fewer:\n\n  use Concerns\\HasAttributes,\n      Concerns\\HasEvents,\n      Concerns\\HasGlobalScopes,\n      Concerns\\HasRelationships,\n      Concerns\\HasTimestamps,\n      Concerns\\HidesAttributes,\n      Concerns\\GuardsAttributes,\n      ForwardsCalls;\n\n\nAlso a trait is useful when used multiple times to avoid duplicate code.\nIf the trait is created to be used exclusively in the model and is tightly linked with the model logic, then why complicate things?\n\nThe code from that TransformsToResource class can't be moved into the model without dependency to the http module in this case so a base model in laravel could solve these dependency issues.\n\n```php\n\n<?php\n\nnamespace App\\Models;\n\nuse ...\n\nabstract class Model extends EloquentModelAlias\n{\n    use HasAttributes,\n        HasEvents,\n        HasGlobalScopes,\n        HasRelationships,\n        HasTimestamps,\n        HasUniqueIds,\n        HidesAttributes,\n        GuardsAttributes,\n        PreventsCircularRecursion,\n        ForwardsCalls;\n    /** @use HasCollection<\\Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Collection<array-key, static & self>> */\n    use HasCollection;\n}\n```\n\nAnd then

will give the control to the developer to use or not some traits while also removing the dependency of database to http module\n\nExcept Laravel's not a modular framework (contrary to what the git tree split would leave you to believe) and you're really fighting against the grain if you're trying to use anything from this repository as a standalone component.  Laravel wants you consuming the full stack framework, to the point that a decent chunk of the core tooling to build applications (like the entire `Illuminate\\Foundation` namespace) is only available with the full stack download or you'd need to be aware of things like the package service providers relying on the fact the concrete `Container` class implements `ArrayAccess` but that's not an interface requirement.\n\nI tried years ago to use parts of Laravel standalone and the longer I went with that project before life pushed me in other directions, the more it felt like I'd have been better off just building a Laravel application instead of just using Laravel's database tooling and the other resources I was using in that project.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2779831726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbabker","id":368545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODU0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/368545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker","html_url":"https://github.com/mbabker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2780222620","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/55272#issuecomment-2780222620","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/55272","id":2780222620,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHMwOs6lttSc","user":{"login":"macropay-solutions","id":153634237,"node_id":"U_kgDOCShFvQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153634237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/macropay-solutions","html_url":"https://github.com/macropay-solutions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macropay-solutions/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macropay-solutions/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macropay-solutions/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macropay-solutions/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macropay-solutions/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macropay-solutions/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macropay-solutions/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macropay-solutions/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macropay-solutions/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-05T05:16:09Z","updated_at":"2025-04-05T05:16:09Z","body":"@mbabker
