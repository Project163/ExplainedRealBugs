It seems that Laravel first places the parameters in the sentences and then selects the sentence based on the _number_ parameter in `trans_choice`. While the correct way is to first select the correct sentence in terms of _number_, then replace the parameters.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n`home.php` file:\r\n```php\r\nreturn [\r\n   'greeting' => '{0} Hello :name|[1,*] Hello :name, you have :count unread messages'\r\n];\r\n```\r\nUsage:\r\n```php\r\ntrans_choice('home.greeting', 0, ['name' => 'Alex | Moi']);\r\n```\r\nAbove code must result in `Hello Alex | Moi`, But it results to `Hello Alex`.","closed_by":{"login":"taylorotwell","id":463230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzIzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/463230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell","html_url":"https://github.com/taylorotwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/53289/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/53289/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
