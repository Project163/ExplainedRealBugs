Fixing Symfony Console 7.3 Deprecation Warning\r\n\r\n## Issue Description\r\n\r\nWhen running `composer run dev` in Laravel 12.16.0 applications with PHP 8.3.14, users were encountering repeated truncated deprecation warnings from Symfony Console 7.3:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[logs] WARNING Since symfony/console 7.3: Method \"Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Command\\Command::getDefaultDescription()\" is deprecated and will be removed in Symfony 8.0, use the #[AsCommand] attribute instead.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe full log message:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"message\": \"Since symfony/console 7.3: Method \\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Console\\\\Command\\\\Command::getDefaultDescription()\\\" is deprecated and will be removed in Symfony 8.0, use the #[AsCommand] attribute instead. in /Users/Kyrian/Packages/filament-daterange-picker/playground/vendor/symfony/deprecation-contracts/function.php on line 25\",\r\n  \"context\": {\r\n    \"__pail\": {\r\n      \"origin\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"console\",\r\n        \"command\": null,\r\n        \"trace\": null\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  \"level\": 300,\r\n  \"level_name\": \"WARNING\",\r\n  \"channel\": \"pail\",\r\n  \"datetime\": \"2025-05-30T11:46:28.118492+00:00\",\r\n  \"extra\": {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nThe issue was related to Laravel's `ClosureCommand` class not having a `$description` property defined. In Symfony Console 7.3, the `getDefaultDescription()` method was deprecated in favor of using the `#[AsCommand]` attribute, and Symfony was generating deprecation warnings because of this.\r\n\r\n## Fix Summary\r\n\r\nThe fix involved adding a `$description` property to the `ClosureCommand` class in Laravel's codebase:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * The console command description.\r\n *\r\n * @var string\r\n */\r\nprotected $description = '';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ensures that when closure commands are created, they have a proper description property that is compatible with Symfony Console 7.3's expectations.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\n1. Added a `$description` property to the `ClosureCommand` class in:\r\n   - `/src/Illuminate/Foundation/Console/ClosureCommand.php`\r\n\r\n2. Created a test to verify that closure commands work correctly:\r\n   - `/tests/Integration/Foundation/Console/ClosureCommandTest.php`\r\n\r\nThis approach follows the same implementation pattern used in Laravel 11, as demonstrated in PR [#55888](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/55888).\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n- Eliminates deprecation warnings when running Artisan commands\r\n- Ensures compatibility with future versions of Symfony Console\r\n- Follows the recommended Symfony practice of defining descriptions via properties\r\n\r\n## Related Issues and PRs\r\n\r\n- Issue: [Laravel Framework #55887](https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/55887)\r\n- Similar fix in Laravel 11: [PR #55888](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/55888)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/55911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/55911/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2934757162","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/55887#issuecomment-2934757162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/55887","id":2934757162,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHMwOs6u7Ncq","user":{"login":"adiologydev","id":9266227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNjYyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9266227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiologydev","html_url":"https://github.com/adiologydev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiologydev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiologydev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiologydev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiologydev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiologydev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiologydev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiologydev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiologydev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adiologydev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-03T11:18:04Z","updated_at":"2025-06-03T11:18:04Z","body":"@crynobone, could you also look at this for 12.x?
