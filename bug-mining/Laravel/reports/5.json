That would prevent issues with calling this method and return an expected result of `null` for the return.\r\n\r\nI can submit a PR if y'all consider this a viable fix.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Register a route with a closure instead of a Controller.\r\n2. Call `getController()` on a `\\Illuminate\\Routing\\Route` instance for that route.","closed_by":{"login":"taylorotwell","id":463230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzIzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/463230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell","html_url":"https://github.com/taylorotwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/49267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/49267/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
