When I then use `->replicate()` on that model, the replication also contains the `laravel_through_key`. This leads to me not being able to save the replication, unless I manually remove the `laravel_through_key`.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nHere's [a failing test in a reproducer repository](https://github.com/levu42/through-key-replicate-bug/commit/8df89b6ba23be5914f74c667a10635b8314b589a#diff-c9fce0bf735ffac56b97383f6d3cfa45440f88fe289e50920f47338cdd93d1df):\r\n\r\n```php\r\n    $organization = Organization::create();\r\n    $department = Department::create(['organization_id' => $organization->id]);\r\n    Employee::create(['department_id' => $department->id, 'name' => 'John']);\r\n\r\n    $employee = $organization->employees()->first();\r\n\r\n    $otherEmployee = $employee->replicate();\r\n    $otherEmployee->name = 'Jane';\r\n    $otherEmployee->save();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives the error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1 table employees has no column named laravel_through_key (Connection: sqlite, SQL: insert into \"employees\" (\"name\", \"department_id\", \"laravel_through_key\", \"updated_at\", \"created_at\") values (Jane, 1, 1, 2024-04-17 11:37:07, 2024-04-17 11:37:07))\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"taylorotwell","id":463230,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzIzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/463230?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell","html_url":"https://github.com/taylorotwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taylorotwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/51097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/51097/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
