it doesn't say exactly that, it is in the list of events fired by a model. [Here](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/eloquent#events)\n\nAnd just as i pointed in my opening post that i tested it directly that it fired indeed!\n\nAlso i understood so by my reading of source code of SoftDeletes Trait and Model Class.\n\nHere is excerpt from Model.class source code responsible:\n```\n/**\n     * Delete the model from the database.\n     *\n     * @return bool|null\n     *\n     * @throws \\LogicException\n     */\n    public function delete()\n    {\n        $this->mergeAttributesFromCachedCasts();\n        if (is_null($this->getKeyName())) {\n            throw new LogicException('No primary key defined on model.');\n        }\n        // If the model doesn't exist, there is nothing to delete so we'll just return\n        // immediately and not do anything else. Otherwise, we will continue with a\n        // deletion process on the model, firing the proper events, and so forth.\n        if (! $this->exists) {\n            return;\n        }\n        if ($this->fireModelEvent('deleting') === false) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        // Here, we'll touch the owning models, verifying these timestamps get updated\n        // for the models. This will allow any caching to get broken on the parents\n        // by the timestamp. Then we will go ahead and delete the model instance.\n        $this->touchOwners();\n        $this->performDeleteOnModel();\n        // Once the model has been deleted, we will fire off the deleted event so that\n        // the developers may hook into post-delete operations. We will then return\n        // a boolean true as the delete is presumably successful on the database.\n        $this->fireModelEvent('deleted', false);\n        return true;\n    }\n```\nHere is the excerpt from SoftDeletes Trait calss (with the over-written method 'performDeleteOnModel()'):\n ```\n    /**\n     * Perform the actual delete query on this model instance.\n     *\n     * @return mixed\n     */\n    protected function performDeleteOnModel()\n    {\n        if ($this->forceDeleting) {\n            return tap($this->setKeysForSaveQuery($this->newModelQuery())->forceDelete(), function () {\n                $this->exists = false;\n            });\n        }\n        return $this->runSoftDelete();\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Perform the actual delete query on this model instance.\n     *\n     * @return void\n     */\n    protected function runSoftDelete()\n    {\n        $query = $this->setKeysForSaveQuery($this->newModelQuery());\n        $time = $this->freshTimestamp();\n        $columns = [$this->getDeletedAtColumn() => $this->fromDateTime($time)];\n        $this->{$this->getDeletedAtColumn()} = $time;\n        if ($this->usesTimestamps() && ! is_null($this->getUpdatedAtColumn())) {\n            $this->{$this->getUpdatedAtColumn()} = $time;\n            $columns[$this->getUpdatedAtColumn()] = $this->fromDateTime($time);\n        }\n        $query->update($columns);\n        $this->syncOriginalAttributes(array_keys($columns));\n        $this->fireModelEvent('trashed', false); //---------------------------------- HERE THE EVENT IS FIRED !!!\n    }\n```\n\nDo you notice the `$this->fireModelEvent('trashed', false);` line?\n\nSo `$model->delete()` would call the overwritten `performDeleteOnModel()` which will call `runSoftDelete()` in which the \"trashed\" event is fired.\n\nAlso why are asking me that? I found the docs are not the best place to get all the info needed.\nDo you not agree here that the docs are a little ambiguous here?\nAlas, if you know something about this event just say it please!

should.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2717186436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"duemti","id":20670448,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjcwNDQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20670448?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duemti","html_url":"https://github.com/duemti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duemti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duemti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duemti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duemti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duemti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duemti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duemti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duemti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duemti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/2717306982","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/54980#issuecomment-2717306982","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/54980","id":2717306982,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHMwOs6h9tBm","user":{"login":"crynobone","id":172966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3Mjk2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone","html_url":"https://github.com/crynobone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/crynobone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-12T09:57:17Z","updated_at":"2025-03-12T09:57:17Z","body":"This

#54980\r\n\r\nI genuinely think this event was somehow forgot to be added there already.\r\n\r\nAdded the missing 'trashed' which gets registered with observers, so that observers too can listen to it besides listeners.\r\nAs per docs:\r\n> Eloquent models dispatch several events, allowing you to hook into the following moments in a model's lifecycle: retrieved, creating, created, updating, updated, saving, saved, deleting, deleted, **trashed**, forceDeleting, forceDeleted, restoring, restored, and replicating.\r\n\r\nNo breaking changes.\r\n\r\nFrom the docs developers expect to listen to this event but if one uses observers then by default the observer would not be able catch it because it never was registered.
