The `Envelope` class doc-hints the `$from` property as `Address|string|NULL`, but the `$to`, `$cc`, `$bcc` and `$replyTo` properties as `array` only.\r\n\r\nThe actual processing happens in [normalizeAddresses()](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/f2bff1c04ee0eb978d2daef4fdc48d27e23f7bf5/src/Illuminate/Mail/Mailables/Envelope.php#L111), which is also built around the expectation that those properties should be passed as arrays.\r\n\r\nI agree, though, that it should be possible to pass a simple `Address` object without the whole thing failing. It would make sense to check if the `$addresses` parameter to `normalizeAddresses()` is an `Address` object, and if so, just wrap it in an array and be done with it.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/1986678425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kokoshneta","id":21343099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzQzMDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21343099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokoshneta","html_url":"https://github.com/kokoshneta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokoshneta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokoshneta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokoshneta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokoshneta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokoshneta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokoshneta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokoshneta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokoshneta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kokoshneta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/comments/1986828647","html_url":"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/50430#issuecomment-1986828647","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/laravel/framework/issues/50430","id":1986828647,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAHMwOs52bJln","user":{"login":"snapey","id":328747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODc0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapey","html_url":"https://github.com/snapey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-09T11:16:21Z","updated_at":"2024-03-09T11:18:07Z","body":"Agreed.
