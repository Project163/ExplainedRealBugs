 Welcome to mypy documentation!
 ==============================
 
-Mypy is a static type checker for Python 3 and Python 2.7.
+Mypy is a static type checker for Python 3 and Python 2.7. If you sprinkle
+your code with type annotations, mypy can type check your code and find common
+bugs. As mypy is a static analyzer, or a lint-like tool, the type
+annotations are just hints for mypy and don't interfere when running your program.
+You run your program with a standard Python interpreter, and the annotations
+are treated effectively as comments.
+
+Using the Python 3 annotation syntax (using :pep:`484` and :pep:`526` notation)
+or a comment-based annotation syntax for Python 2 code, you will be able to
+efficiently annotate your code and use mypy to check the code for common errors.
+Mypy has a powerful and easy-to-use type system with modern features such as
+type inference, generics, callable types, tuple types, union types, and
+structural subtyping.
+
+As a developer, you decide how to use mypy in your workflow. You can always
+escape to dynamic typing as mypy's approach to static typing doesn't restrict
+what you can do in your programs. Using mypy will make your programs easier to
+understand, debug, and maintain.
+
+This documentation provides a short introduction to mypy. It will help you
+get started writing statically typed code. Knowledge of Python and a
+statically typed object-oriented language, such as Java, are assumed.
+
+.. note::
+
+   Mypy is used in production by many companies and projects, but mypy is
+   officially beta software. There will be occasional changes
+   that break backward compatibility. The mypy development team tries to
+   minimize the impact of changes to user code.
