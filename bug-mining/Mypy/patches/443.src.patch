 Mypy no longer considers an import such as `import a.b as b` as an explicit re-export. The old behavior was arguably inconsistent and surprising. This may impact some stub packages, such as older versions of `types-six`. You can change the import to `from a import b as b`, if treating the import as a re-export was intentional.
 
 This change was contributed by Anders Kaseorg (PR [14086](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14086)).

If the method is then renamed in the base class while the method override is not, mypy will generate an error. The decorator will be available in typing in Python 3.12, but you can also use the backport from a recent version of `typing_extensions` on all supported Python versions.

 Mypy now allows narrowing enum types using the \== operator. Previously this was only supported when using the is operator. This makes exhaustiveness checking with enum types more usable, as the requirement to use the is operator was not very intuitive. In this example mypy can detect that the developer forgot to handle the value MyEnum.C in example
