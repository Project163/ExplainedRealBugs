This prevents the actual aliased type from being recorded in the stub file, and causes mypy to emit a `[valid-type]` error.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\nCreate a file `tmp.py`:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypeAlias\n\nFoo: TypeAlias = tuple[int, str]\n```\n\nThen run `stubgen tmp.py`.\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\n<!--\nHow did you expect mypy to behave? It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\nWrite down what you thought would happen. If you expected no errors, delete this section.\n-->\nI'm not exactly sure what the expected behavior is. I guess maybe it should behave similarly to `Foo = tuple[int, str]` (i.e. without the `TypeAlias` typehint), which stubgen includes verbatim in the stub file.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\n<!-- What went wrong? Paste mypy's output. -->\nThe stubbed type was only `TypeAlias`\n```\n$ cat out/tmp.pyi \nfrom typing import TypeAlias\n\nFoo: TypeAlias\n```\nThen if this stub is used, mypy emits the following error:\n```\nInvalid type alias: expression is not a valid type  [valid-type]\nFoo: TypeAlias\n^\n```\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\n\n- Mypy version used: 1.15.0\n- Mypy command-line flags: n/a\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): n/a\n- Python version used: 3.10\n\n<!-- You can freely edit this text, please remove all the lines you believe are unnecessary. -->\n","closed_by":{"login":"sobolevn","id":4660275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjAyNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4660275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn","html_url":"https://github.com/sobolevn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18905/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
