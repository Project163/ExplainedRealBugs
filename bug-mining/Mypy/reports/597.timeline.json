g further into it and working on improving the error experience (including the message) as discussed in our meeting, I'm looking at `testMetaclassSubclassSelf` and in particular `ChildOfConflict1`. My opinion on this is that, while mypy is (most of the time, anyway) correct in assuming that this class has a metaclass conflict, I don't think the error helps the user at all, because this is not where the error originates (which would be the class definition of `Conflict3`). I think, this behavior of mypy just a) pollutes the output, making it harder for the user to find the place in the code they need to fix and b) should mypy be incorrect about some assumptions (like with some built-in types), it's not enough to just mute the single place of failure (`Conflict3`) but *every* child class of it as well, which can be very tedious.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about only emitting a metaclass conflict at the place it's introduced at?\r\n\r\nThis poses some technical difficulty as it's unclear, which metaclass mypy should assume for a class it considered having a metaclass conflict. But I think this can be resolved by traversing the mro and accepting the first explicitly declared metaclass as truth while falling back to `type` if there is none (which I believe can't actually happen).\r\n\r\nThoughts on this proposal?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1311916515/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"robsdedude","id":4061254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjEyNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4061254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robsdedude","html_url":"https://github.com/robsdedude","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robsdedude/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robsdedude/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robsdedude/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robsdedude/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robsdedude/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robsdedude/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robsdedude/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robsdedude/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robsdedude/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1311933308","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14033#issuecomment-1311933308","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14033","id":1311933308,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5OMoN8","user":{"login":"erictraut","id":7040122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDAxMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7040122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut","html_url":"https://github.com/erictraut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-11T16:42:44Z","updated_at":"2022-11-11T16:43:38Z","body":"@sobolevn, you said \"So, it has ABCMeta metaclass according to the typeshed\".

Documentation\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure if this is an issue with the docs or the interpreter. But it's evident that the docs don't match what the interpreter does.\r\n\r\nThe docs [say here](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Doc/reference/datamodel.rst#determining-the-appropriate-metaclass):\r\n\r\n> The appropriate metaclass for a class definition is determined as follows:\r\n> \r\n> * if no bases and no explicit metaclass are given, then :func:`type` is used;\r\n> * if an explicit metaclass is given and it is *not* an instance of\r\n>   :func:`type`, then it is used directly as the metaclass;\r\n> * if an instance of :func:`type` is given as the explicit metaclass, or\r\n>   bases are defined, then the most derived metaclass is used.\r\n> \r\n> The most derived metaclass is selected from the explicitly specified\r\n> metaclass (if any) and the metaclasses (i.e. ``type(cls)``) of all specified\r\n> base classes. The most derived metaclass is one which is a subtype of *all*\r\n> of these candidate metaclasses. If none of the candidate metaclasses meets\r\n> that criterion, then the class definition will fail with ``TypeError``.\r\n\r\nSo according to that, the metaclass of `D` in this code \r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass M1(type): pass\r\nclass M2(type): pass\r\nclass Mx(M1, M2): pass\r\n\r\nclass A1(metaclass=M1): pass\r\nclass A2(A1): pass\r\n\r\nclass B1(metaclass=M2): pass\r\n\r\nclass C1(metaclass=Mx): pass\r\n\r\nclass D(A2, B1, C1): pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould be `Mx` as it's the most derived of all candidates (`M1`, `M2`, `Mx`). But instead the cpython exitis with\r\n```\r\n    class D(A2, B1, C1): pass\r\nTypeError: metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `class D(A2, C1, B1): pass` works.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome additional context:\r\n * I was investigating a [false positive metaclass conflict reported by mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14033) when I came across this\r\n * This piece of docs seems to origin from way back in 2005, [issue #42380](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/42380#issuecomment-1094012308)\r\n\r\nAs said above, I'm not even sure what the actually algorithm is that determines the implicit metaclass. From my experimentation, I assume it's:\r\n * If there's an explicit metaclass, it is checked to be a sub-class of the metaclass of each parent\r\n * If there's no explicit metaclass, the parents are checked from left to right:\r\n   * When a new metaclass is encountered, it is checked to be a sub-class of the previous implicit metaclass and, if it is, set as the new implicit metaclass.\r\n\n\n<!-- gh-linked-prs -->\n### Linked PRs\n* gh-123349\n<!-- /gh-linked-prs

:) Again, thank you for your work and your quick fix in my previous issue!\r\n\r\nI found a new problem in `v2.0.0b1`, which I could not reproduce in `v1.0.0`. MWE:\r\n```python\r\nfrom pydantic_xml import BaseXmlModel\r\n\r\nclass A(BaseXmlModel): pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `mypy` on it results in:\r\n```bash\r\n$ mypy test.py\r\ntest.py:3: error: Metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases  [misc]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm unsure if this is a `mypy` bug or not, but in my normal code, this results in this `mypy` error for each subclass of `BaseXmlModel` I have.\r\n\r\nI also found this `mypy` issue which suggests that adding a `# type: ignore[misc]` to the `class BaseXmlModel` line could be a workaround: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14033#issuecomment-1307044115\r\nBut to be honest, I do not know enough about Python metaclasses to give you a better problem analysis and solution proposal.\r\nOn the other hand, you may already have seen a similar issue, as you apparently added the same type ignore a few lines above the `BaseXmlModel` definition for version 2:
