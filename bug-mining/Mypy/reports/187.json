Alternatively, you can use [--install-types](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-install-types) to install all known missing stubs [...]\r\n\r\nThis is incomplete, as it only addresses the issue of missing stubs.\r\n\r\nIn my case, the issue is that the stubs are not compatible with Python 3.10. I'm confirming this by trying to use Python 3.8, in which case the error disappears and type checking works.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have no idea about what any of that means or entails, as, to the best of my documentation-searching abilities, it's not documented. What makes stubs to be incompatible with a particular Python version? I think that should be documented and referenced in the aforementioned section.\r\n\r\n(Stubs not installed and incompatible stubs should also probably separated into two different error states, as for incompatile stubs the advice in the notes is irrelevant and confusing, but this is probably beyond this bug report)","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
