Install the following requirements with pip:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nmypy==0.900\r\nmypy-extensions==0.4.3\r\npip==21.1.2\r\nPyYAML==5.4.1\r\nsetuptools==57.0.0\r\ntoml==0.10.2\r\ntyped-ast==1.4.3\r\ntyping-extensions==3.10.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Put the following code in `test.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run `mypy test.py`, which will display the following output:\r\n\r\n```console\r\ntest.py:1: error: Library stubs not installed for \"yaml\" (or incompatible with Python 3.7)\r\ntest.py:1: note: Hint: \"python3 -m pip install types-PyYAML\"\r\ntest.py:1: note: (or run \"mypy --install-types\" to install all missing stub packages)\r\ntest.py:1: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#missing-imports\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n4.
