MR allows python classes created in C++ to show up in IDEs and work with linters. It works by using pybind11-stubgen to create .pyi files that are then included in the package. The result is this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42954918/167733517-86305e60-2ed4-4a4b-96e8-45e67617c569.png)\r\n\r\nOnly downside is the pybind11-stubgen isnt too actively maintained (but its also not complex). And the option for generating the output location is limited. So in our output we get:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncommon/\r\n   __init__.pyi\r\ncudf_helpers/\r\n   __init__.pyi\r\nmessages/\r\n   __init__.pyi\r\nstages/\r\n   __init__.pyi\r\ncommon.so\r\ncudf_helpers.so\r\nmessages.so\r\nstages.so\r\n```\r\nIt would be better to be organized like the following:\r\n```\r\ncommon.pyi\r\ncommon.so\r\ncudf_helpers.pyi\r\ncudf_helpers.so\r\nmessages.pyi\r\nmessages.so\r\nstages.pyi\r\nstages.so\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only alternative is to use mypy.

Description\r\n\r\nCloses #11965.\r\n\r\nAdd a --include-docstrings flag to stubgen. This was suggested in #11965 along with a use case.\r\nWhen using this flag, the .pyi files will include docstrings for Python classes and functions and for C extension functions.\r\nThe flag is optional and does not change the default stubgen behaviour. When using the flag, the resulting function stubs that contain docstring will no longer be one-liners, but functions without a docstring still retain the default one-liner style.\r\n\r\nExample input:\r\n```python\r\nclass A:\r\n    \"\"\"class docstring\"\"\"\r\n    def func():\r\n        \"\"\"func docstring\"\"\"\r\n        ...\r\n    def nodoc():\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\noutput:\r\n```python\r\nclass A:\r\n    \"\"\"class docstring\"\"\"\r\n    def func() -> None:\r\n        \"\"\"func docstring\"\"\"\r\n        ...\r\n    def nodoc() -> None: ...\r\n```\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nTests `testIncludeDocstrings` and `testIgnoreDocstrings` were added to `test-data/unit/stubgen.test` to ensure the code works as intended. All other tests passed as well.\r\n\r\nC extension docstrings are tested using an updated bash script `misc/test_stubgenc.sh` with test data in `test-data/pybind11_mypy_demo/stubgen-include-docs` in same fashion as in an already existing test.
