Description\r\n\r\nFixes #12615\r\n\r\nAs discussed in the linked issue, this  PR would put a filesystem-based lock around the pip install steps of the suite of PEP561 testcases, to address race conditions.\r\n\r\nIt introduces a test-dependency on tox-dev/py-filelock. I used 3.0.0 as a lower bound, simply because that's what the tox version mentioned in tox.ini specifies as its lower bound. However from the release history it seems that Python 3.6 support was dropped in 3.4.2, hence the second line in the requirements.\r\n\r\nI ended up just adding the location of the lock file to .gitignore -- I guess it would be possible to try and remove it after the suite has run, e.g. with atexit.register, but I didn't want to make this complicated.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nNo new tests, just moved the PEP561 suite from \"slow\" to \"slower\" in `runtests.py`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12857/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1134594410","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12615#issuecomment-1134594410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12615","id":1134594410,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5DoIlq","user":{"login":"erikkemperman","id":3100637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMDA2Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3100637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikkemperman","html_url":"https://github.com/erikkemperman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikkemperman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikkemperman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikkemperman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikkemperman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikkemperman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikkemperman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikkemperman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikkemperman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erikkemperman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-23T12:11:36Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T12:11:36Z","body":"@ethans
