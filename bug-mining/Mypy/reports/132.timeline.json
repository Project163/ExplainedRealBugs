Report**\r\n\r\nIt seems the `typing.TypeGuard` support is not able to properly discriminate a union of two (generic) types.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n* The example below defines two completely distinct types, `Left[L]` and `Right[R]`, both of which happen to be generic and have a `.value` attribute.\r\n* The `LeftOrRight` is a `Union` of those types.\r\n* `x` is a variable of type `LeftOrRight[str, int]`. In this example it has value `Left(\"\")`\r\n* Using `isinstance()` works fine to figure out whether `x` is either `Left` or `Right`, and within the `if/else` block the types are correct, including the types `L` and `R` (both `TypeVar`)\r\n* The `is_left()` and `is_right()` helpers use `typing.TypeGuard`, but Mypy does not recognize the types like it did with the `isinstance()` check.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Generic, TypeGuard, TypeVar, Union\r\n\r\nL = TypeVar(\"L\")\r\nR = TypeVar(\"R\")\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Left(Generic[L]):\r\n    value: L\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, value: L):\r\n        self.value = value\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Right(Generic[R]):\r\n    value: R\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, value: R):\r\n        self.value = value\r\n\r\n\r\nLeftOrRight = Union[Left[L], Right[R]]\r\n\r\n\r\ndef is_left(obj: LeftOrRight[L, R]) -> TypeGuard[Left[L]]:\r\n    return isinstance(obj, Left)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef is_right(obj: LeftOrRight[L, R]) -> TypeGuard[Right[R]]:\r\n    return isinstance(obj, Right)\r\n\r\n\r\nx: LeftOrRight[str, int] = Left(\"\")\r\nreveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is \"Union[Left[builtins.str], Right[builtins.int]]\"\r\n\r\nif isinstance(x, Left):\r\n    reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is \"Left[builtins.str]\"\r\n    x.value + \"\"  # only valid for str\r\nelse:\r\n    reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is \"Right[builtins.int]\"\r\n    x.value + 10  # only valid for int\r\n\r\nif is_left(x):\r\n    reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is \"Left[L`-1]\"\r\n    x.value + \"\"  #  Unsupported left operand type for + (\"L\")  [operator]\r\nelse:\r\n    reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is \"Union[Left[builtins.str], Right[builtins.int]]\"\r\n    x.value + 10  # Unsupported operand types for + (\"str\" and \"int\")  [operator]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\n`is_left()` and `is_right()` act as type-safe ways to discriminate between the two members of the `Union`, including the actual type of the (generic) `.value` attribute.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n* `reveal_type()` returns wrong results\r\n* type errors reported in what seems to be perfectly fine and very strict code\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\nThis happens with both Mypy 0.910 (current release as time of writing) and today's `git` checkout of the main branch.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11428/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11428/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/997007217","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11780#issuecomment-997007217","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11780","id":997007217,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc47bR9x","user":{"login":"wbolster","id":748944,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODk0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/748944?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbolster","html_url":"https://github.com/wbolster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbolster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbolster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbolster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbolster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbolster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbolster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbolster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbolster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wbolster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-17T20:17:05Z","updated_at":"2021-12-17T20:17:05Z","body":"i think this can be closed as a duplicate of #11428, @MicaelJarniac?

believe the bug in question is to do with `TypeVar`, and not `Generic`, as your issue implies.\r\n\r\nAnd in my opinion, the examples I've given here are easier to understand and more straight to the point.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about what to do.\r\n\r\nOne thing I did not test is whether the issue I'm describing here also happens on Python 3.10, and that's why this issue is about the `TypeGuard` from `typing_extensions`.\r\nBut the issue you're having seems to be happening on at least Python 3.10.\r\n\r\nI do think our issues are about the same bug, but we've come across it in different ways.\r\n\r\nI'll try to test my examples against Python 3.10, to see whether it's in any way related to `typing_extensions` or not.\r\nIf it is still happening on 3.10, then I do think we could look into merging both issues onto
