This involves for example:\r\n\r\n- `testConditionalFunctionDefinitionUsingDecorator3` (there's an error in the test that the test author probably didn't notice: Positional only args of a callable are never assignable to a normal function with positional-or-keyword params; typically an error in Mypy would look like this: `Incompatible redefinition (redefinition with type \"Callable[[int], None]\", original type \"Callable[[Arg(int, 'x')], None]\")`)\r\n- `testConditionalFunctionDefinitionUsingDecorator4` (there's even a TODO in there that complains about this not being done)\r\n- `testNewAnalyzerConditionalDecoratedFunc`\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Callable\r\ndef dec(f) -> Callable[[int], None]: raise NotImplementedError\r\n\r\nif int():\r\n    def f(x: str): pass\r\nelse:\r\n    @dec\r\n    def f() -> None: pass   \r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.12&gist=18b131da809d740eced20dd7652ea213\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if Mypy complained here (like in AFAIK all other conditional definitions).\r\n\r\nI'm happy to assist if somebody wants to fix this.","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17211/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
