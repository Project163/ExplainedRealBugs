for the ping, @brianschubert. I've never been a Cython developer, so I can't speak to how that interacts with all this, and I don't know anything about how `__cinit__` compiles into python. \n\nThat said, I'm the author of the change to stubtest which is likely causing your change: https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18259. \n\nMy experience there is that this happens when your stub defines `__init__` but the class is actually using a custom `__new__`.\n\n```python\n>>> from scipy.io.matlab._mio5_utils import VarReader5\n>>> from scipy.stats import sampling\n>>> VarReader5.__init__.__objclass__\n<class 'object'>\n>>> VarReader5.__new__.__self__\n<class 'scipy.io.matlab._mio5_utils.VarReader5'>\n>>> sampling.TransformedDensityRejection.__init__.__objclass__\n<class 'object'>\n>>> sampling.TransformedDensityRejection.__new__.__self__\n<class 'scipy.stats._unuran.unuran_wrapper.TransformedDensityRejection'>\n>>> sampling.SimpleRatioUniforms.__init__.__objclass__\n<class 'object'>\n>>> sampling.SimpleRatioUniforms.__new__.__self__\n<class 'scipy.stats._unuran.unuran_wrapper.SimpleRatioUniforms'>\n>>> sampling.NumericalInversePolynomial.__init__.__objclass__\n<class 'object'>\n>>> sampling.NumericalInversePolynomial.__new__.__self__\n<class 'scipy.stats._unuran.unuran_wrapper.NumericalInversePolynomial'>\n>>> sampling.NumericalInverseHermite.__init__.__objclass__\n<class 'object'>\n>>> sampling.NumericalInverseHermite.__new__.__self__\n<class 'scipy.stats._unuran.unuran_wrapper.NumericalInverseHermite'>\n>>> sampling.DiscreteAliasUrn.__init__.__objclass__\n<class 'object'>\n>>> sampling.DiscreteAliasUrn.__new__.__self__\n<class 'scipy.stats._unuran.unuran_wrapper.DiscreteAliasUrn'>\n>>> sampling.DiscreteGuideTable.__init__.__objclass__\n<class 'object'>\n>>> sampling.DiscreteGuideTable.__new__.__self__\n<class 'scipy.stats._unuran.unuran_wrapper.DiscreteGuideTable'>\n```\n\nThe difference in practice is subtle, but there are scenarios involving subclassing where this matters. See my comment at https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18259#issuecomment-2524716786 for an example. I believe your new stubtest errors are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom math import exp\nfrom scipy.stats.sampling import TransformedDensityRejection\n\nclass StandardNormal:\n    def pdf(self, x: float)

While the error is technically correct,  it's pretty opaque and doesn't give users an obvious path for how to fix it. \n\nI wonder if we could use some heuristic to detect situations like this and add a note warning stub authors to look out for `__init__` vs `__new__` discrepancies?
