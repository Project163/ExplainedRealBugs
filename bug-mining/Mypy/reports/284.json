Though \"misc\" is non-specific, having an error code allowed for ignoring these errors when linting Jupyter notebook files (using `nbqa mypy file.ipynb` with [nbqa](https://github.com/nbQA-dev/nbQA)). Jupyter notebooks already automatically run cells in an async awaited eventloop context (see [here](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/autoawait.html#using-autoawait-in-a-notebook-ipykernel)), so it's important to be able to ignore these top-level `await` usages in ipynb files. For instance, Pylance added logic to handle this situation directly here https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/1754#issuecomment-1028462082.\r\n\r\nAs of mypy 1.0.0, mypy no longer assigns an error code when `await` is used outside a function, and treats it as a blocking error that prevents further checking. This means it's now no longer possible to lint notebook files that use `await` with mypy+nbqa.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this change in behavior was introduced in https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14486 [here](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14486/files#diff-f782aad4853edceb67a88efe43d2869579d075a77b8e8dd2add91e818a9fa164R5168)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nRun `await` in the top level of some file (notebook or otherwise):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nasync def foo():\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nawait foo()\r\n```\r\n\r\nCompare:\r\n- mypy 1.0.0: https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=1.0.0&python=3.11&gist=a97bbbf61fb0e0747b4f0a74d4a2124c\r\n    ```\r\n    main.py:4: error: \"await\" outside function\r\n    Found 1 error in 1 file (errors prevented further checking)\r\n    ```\r\n- mypy 0.991: https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=0.991&python=3.11&gist=a97bbbf61fb0e0747b4f0a74d4a2124c\r\n    ```\r\n    main.py:4: error: \"await\" outside function  [misc]\r\n    Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nmypy does *not* halt further checking, and mypy uses an error-code for `\"await\" outside function`, so that users can choose to disable the warning when that occurs. That will allow mypy to continue to be used/useful for Jupyter notebook files (for instance, setting `--disable-error-code=misc` when using `nbqa`).\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nmypy returns a blocking error and does not provide a workaround.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 1.0.1 or 1.0.0\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: `--disable-error-code=misc`\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): any\r\n- Python version used: 3.10+\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14763/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14763/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
