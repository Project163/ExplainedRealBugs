There are plenty of issues related to the PEP 604 syntax but none that are really about using `typing.Union`/`typing.Optional`/...\r\n- Support for PEP 604 syntax was recently added in  #11673 / #17371 \r\n- Old style unions were briefly mentioned in https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17371#pullrequestreview-2115445793\r\n\r\n**Feature**\r\n\r\nExample code\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Any, Union, Optional\r\n\r\nfoo: Any = None\r\n\r\nif isinstance(foo, int | None):\r\n    reveal_type(foo)\r\n\r\nif isinstance(foo, Union[int, None]):\r\n    reveal_type(foo)\r\n\r\nif isinstance(foo, Optional[int]):\r\n    reveal_type(foo)\r\n\r\nbar = int | None\r\nbaz = Optional[int]\r\nif isinstance(foo, bar):\r\n    reveal_type(foo)\r\n\r\nif isinstance(foo, baz):\r\n    reveal_type(foo)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput for the above with mypy v1.11.1:\r\n```\r\nsrc/union.py:6: note: Revealed type is \"Union[builtins.int, None]\"\r\nsrc/union.py:8: error: Argument 2 to \"isinstance\" has incompatible type \"<typing special form>\"; expected \"_ClassInfo\"  [arg-type]\r\nsrc/union.py:9: note: Revealed type is \"Any\"\r\nsrc/union.py:11: error: Argument 2 to \"isinstance\" has incompatible type \"<typing special form>\"; expected \"_ClassInfo\"  [arg-type]\r\nsrc/union.py:12: note: Revealed type is \"Any\"\r\nsrc/union.py:17: note: Revealed type is \"Union[builtins.int, None]\"\r\nsrc/union.py:19: error: Parameterized generics cannot be used with class or instance checks  [misc]\r\nsrc/union.py:19: error: Argument 2 to \"isinstance\" has incompatible type \"<typing special form>\"; expected \"_ClassInfo\"  [arg-type]\r\nsrc/union.py:20: note: Revealed type is \"Any\"\r\nFound 4 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the above with pyright:\r\n```\r\n.../src/union.py\r\n  .../src/union.py:6:17 - information: Type of \"foo\" is \"int | None\"\r\n  .../src/union.py:9:17 - information: Type of \"foo\" is \"int | None\"\r\n  .../src/union.py:12:17 - information: Type of \"foo\" is \"int | None\"\r\n  .../src/union.py:17:17 - information: Type of \"foo\" is \"int | None\"\r\n  .../src/union.py:20:17 - information: Type of \"foo\" is \"int | None\"\r\n0 errors, 0 warnings, 5 informations\r\n```\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n- when using the PEP 604-syntax the type is correctly narrowed to `Union[builtins.int, None]`\r\n- when using the `typing.Union` and/or `typing.Optional` syntax the type is not narrowed and remains `Any` (and errors are shown)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17680/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17680/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
