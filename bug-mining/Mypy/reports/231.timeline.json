it seems that `Protocol` is the preferred way to add type hints to mixins (using them with Django). Is there a way to define `super` calls with the help of a `Protocol`? Something like this doesn't seem to work:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Base(Protocol):\r\n    get_data: Callable\r\n\r\nclass MyMixin:\r\n    def get(self: Base):\r\n        self.get_data() # this is ok\r\n        super().get_data()  # type error here\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I understand the issue from mypy correctly (or maybe not), then something like this [was implemented

Report**\r\n\r\nEmpty properties defined in a protocol class that is subclassed by another protocol are incorrectly classified by mypy as abstract methods - this can then result in a `safe-super` error if the parent property is accessed via `super()` within a class that is type hinted with the child protocol, e.g. when type hinting `self` in mixin classes (as described [here](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/more_types.html#mixin-classes)).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nfrom typing import Protocol, Optional, NoReturn\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Dataset(Protocol):\r\n    def validate(self) -> Optional[NoReturn]:\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n    @property\r\n    def has_schema(self) -> bool:\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n\r\nclass TSDataset(Dataset, Protocol):\r\n    @property\r\n    def num_rows(self) -> int:\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n\r\nclass TSDatasetMixin:\r\n    def check_schema(self: TSDataset) -> None:\r\n        super().validate()\r\n        if super().has_schema:\r\n            print('Dataset has a schema')\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nNo errors.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n```\r\nmypy_safe_super_protocol.py:24: error: Call to abstract method \"has_schema\" of \"Dataset\" with trivial body via super() is unsafe  [safe-super]\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file
