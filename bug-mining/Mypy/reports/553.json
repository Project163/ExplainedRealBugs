Any additional source files in the project (whether they import the `wrapper` or not) will also have the error message applied to them, which makes failing runs vastly less useful.\r\n\r\nRunning with `--no-incremental` appears to avoid the issue; I can run several times in a row with `--no-incremental` without encountering the failure mode (and have not seen it with that flag enabled).\r\n\r\nRunning with `--namespace-packages` appears to have no effect.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately as `ruamel.yaml` is a typed library, ignoring the imports with `type: ignore[import]` ends up generating more errors as the ignores appear unused on a \"successful\" run (and you have `warn_unused_ignores` enabled).\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Setup & versions</summary>\r\n\r\n``` shell\r\npython3.9 -m venv venv\r\n. venv/bin/activate\r\npip install -U pip setuptools wheel\r\npip install mypy ruamel.yaml\r\n```\r\n``` shell\r\n$ pip list\r\nPackage           Version\r\n----------------- -------\r\nmypy              0.942\r\nmypy-extensions   0.4.3\r\npip               22.0.4\r\nruamel.yaml       0.17.21\r\nruamel.yaml.clib  0.2.6\r\nsetuptools        62.1.0\r\ntomli             2.0.1\r\ntyping_extensions 4.2.0\r\nwheel             0.37.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 0.942\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: see above\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): none\r\n- Python version used: 3.9 (though similar behaviour observed on other versions; at least on 3.8)\r\n- Operating system and version: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12664/reactions","total_count":29,"+1":26,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12664/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
