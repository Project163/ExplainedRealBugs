However, mypy on the `master` branch emits the following errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfoo.pyi:7: error: Overloaded function signatures 1 and 2 overlap with incompatible return types  [overload-overlap]\r\nfoo.pyi:13: error: Expression is of type \"Any\", not \"DataFrame\"  [assert-type]\r\nfoo.pyi:14: error: Expression is of type \"Any\", not \"DataFrame\"  [assert-type]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first error here seems reasonable to me, but it's unclear to me why mypy now infers `Any` as the result of the `df` subscriptions.
