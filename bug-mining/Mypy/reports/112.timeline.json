Report**\r\n\r\n`module google.cloud has no attribute firestore`\r\nThe bug is that this statement is not true.\r\n\r\nThere have been a few related stackoverflow issues (e.g. [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63339732/module-google-cloud-has-no-attribute-storage), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55212535/issue-with-google-cloud-storage-module-has-no-attribute-client/55212631#55212631)) relating to incorrect \"module x as no attribute y\" specifically relating to google.cloud.\r\nSome issues were sorted by recreating the virtual env.\r\nOther issues on this repo were historically traced back to using incremental mode but solution seemed incomplete (e.g. [1](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10360), [2](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12232)).\r\nWe disabled mypy cache (e.g. incremental mode) which dealt with a chunk of the problem\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nHard to know exactly how to reproduce because the problem with this issue is it seems random and indeterministic - even after disabling incremental mode.\r\n\r\nAll I can tell you is in our code we do:\r\n```python\r\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery, firestore\r\n```\r\nBoth `google-cloud-bigquery` and `google-cloud-firestore` are in setup.cfg/requirements.txt and installed in the virtual environment which mypy is being activated from.\r\n\r\nWe have no issues (currently) with the bigquery import but we do with firestore. They are completely identical for all intents and purposes here.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behaviour**\r\n\r\nNo complaint about missing attribute.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behaviour**\r\n\r\nIncorrect complaint about missing attribute.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\nmypy 0.950 (compiled: yes)\r\npython 3.9.x\r\n\r\nPlease can we get to the bottom of this once and for all?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12985/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12985/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"MaxG87","id":5477952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0Nzc5NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5477952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxG87","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxG87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxG87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxG87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxG87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxG87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxG87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxG87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxG87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxG87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxG87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-07T13:30:05Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T13:30:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13085","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13085/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13085/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13085/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13085","id":1297447061,"node_id":"I_kwDOAGuhRc5NVXiV","number":13085,"title":"Cache

is very similar to #12232. However, I had to modify the minimum working example, because `mypy==0.961` fixed the other one.\r\n\r\n**Bug Report**\r\nI have a project that imports things from `google.cloud`, which is a namespace package as far as I know. In a certain, very specific configuration mypy fails on every second run. This is very similar to #9852 and an almost duplicate of #12232. However, this bug affects the most recent mypy, 0.961. Since the reproducer of #9852 and #12232 are fixed, I open a new bug report.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nThe following script does reproduce the problem on Debian Stable and inside the Docker image `python:latest`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\r\n\r\nVENV=$(mktemp -d)\r\n\r\nrm -rf \"$VENV\"\r\n\r\n# The order of the imports matters. If one imports datastore first, the error\r\n# does not occur. Also, one must suppress the type error on the import of\r\n# `storage`, otherwise the error does not appear neither.\r\ncat <<EOF >script.py\r\nfrom google.cloud import storage  # type: ignore[attr-defined]\r\nfrom google.cloud.exceptions import NotFound\r\nEOF\r\n\r\npython3 -m venv \"$VENV\"\r\nsource \"$VENV/bin/activate\"\r\npython3 -m pip install mypy==0.961 google-cloud-storage==2.0.0 google-cloud-datastore==2.4.0\r\n\r\nmypy script.py\r\nmypy script.py\r\nmypy script.py\r\nmypy script.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\nPass or fail every time. I am not sure what would be correct in this case.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\nMypy accepts and rejects the code every 2nd run.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\nDebian Stable and `python:latest`. The reproducing script should cover all relevant details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13085/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
