No error if there's no type hint in the constructor (type unimportant)\r\n    def __init__(self, args: int):\r\n        # The next line succeeds if it's a tuple, but fails on list.\r\n        self.var_a = []\r\n        # The type of this variable doesn't seem to matter at all, but it needs\r\n        # to exist and be trying to set a property.\r\n        self.var_b = None\r\n\r\n    # This needs to be a property, but the getter doesn't affect anything.\r\n    var_b = property(fset=lambda self, value: None)\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Child(Parent):\r\n    @property  # Error reported on this line.\r\n    def var_a(self):\r\n        return self._var_a\r\n\r\n    @var_a.setter\r\n    def var_a(self, value):\r\n        self._var_a = []\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was run with `mypy --show-traceback partial_list.py` in an empty venv, after deleting the `.mypy-cache` directory, and I don't think there's any other configuration being pulled from anywhere.\r\n\r\nThis was as small a reproducer as I could find.  It seems to matter that there are two properties (although one of them only needs a setter), and the child class seems to need to be overriding a partially typed instance variable with a getter property that's also partially typed.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: master: 0.920.dev @ 01e6aba\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: `--show-traceback`\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): none\r\n- Python version used: 3.9 and 3.10\r\n- Operating system and version: macOS 11.6\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nYou can freely edit this text, please remove all the lines\r\nyou believe are unnecessary.\r\n-->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11686/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
