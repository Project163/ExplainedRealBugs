`--enable-incomplete-features`\r\n* [ ] Implement as much of `Unpack` and `TypeVarTuple` as possible @jhance \r\n* [x] Enable recursive types by default @ilevkivskyi \r\n* [x] Make `implicit_optional` off by default (with a code transform tool to fix existing annotations) @hauntsaninja \r\n* [x] Detect unbound variables @ilinum \r\n* [ ] Use unions for ternary joins @JelleZijlstra \r\n* [x] Full support for non-typing 3.11 features, see https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12840\r\n* [x] Support as many typing 3.11 features as we can (including `Enum`)\r\n* [x] Make `--namespace-packages` the default @hauntsaninja \r\n* [ ] Allow/disallow PEP 561 packages @ethanhs \r\n\r\nLess important things:\r\n* [ ] Support default value of generic parameter\r\n* [ ] Always narrow types (see #2008)\r\n* [ ] Fix lost narrowing in inner functions\r\n* [ ] Make `--local-partial-types` enabled by default (if fallout is not
