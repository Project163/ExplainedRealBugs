changes our importing logic to be more consistent and to treat import statements more like assignments.\r\n\r\nFixes #13803, fixes #13914, fixes half of #12965, probably fixes #12574\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for this is when typing modules as protocols, as in #13803. But it turns out we already allowed redefinition with \"from\" imports, so this also seems like a nice consistency win.\r\n\r\nWe move shared logic from visit_import_all and visit_import_from (via process_imported_symbol) into add_imported_symbol. We then reuse it in visit_import.\r\n\r\nTo simplify stuff, we inline the code from add_module_symbol into visit_import. Then we copy over logic from add_symbol, because MypyFile is not a SymbolTableNode, but this isn't the worst thing ever.\r\n\r\nFinally, we now need to check non-from import statements like assignments, which was a thing we weren't doing earlier.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13969/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7728960360,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5TKwVbzwAAAAHMrpNo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7728960360","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-03T05:10:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7728960434,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5TKwVbzwAAAAHMrpOy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7728960434","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a4da89e0543ee0d213b30216c9e15a5d00fcd578","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/a4da89e0543ee0d213b30216c9e15a5d00fcd578","created_at":"2022-11-03T05:10:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1301646502","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13803#issuecomment-1301646502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13803","id":1301646502,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5NlYym","user":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-03T05:11:07Z","updated_at":"2022-11-03T05:11:07Z","body":"Thanks for reporting!
