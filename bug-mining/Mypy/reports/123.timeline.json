Description\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for instance variables to have the _fget_ attribute (e.g. instance variable in a C class in an extension) but\r\ninspect.isdatadescriptor return True as expected, hence we update the 'is_c_property' check.\r\n\r\nSince special attributes (like \\_\\_dict\\_\\_ etc) also passes 'is_c_property' check, we ignore all such special attributes in\r\n'generate_c_property_stub' while creating the contents of stub file.\r\n\r\nAlso, 'is_c_property_readonly' assumed that the property would always have 'fset' attribute which again is not true for instance variables in C extension. Hence make the check defensive by first checking if 'fset' attribute even exists or not.\r\n\r\nFixes #12150.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n- Ran the test suite as described in [Contributing-Running tests](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-tests). All tests are running fine.\r\n\r\n- Ran stubgen on a C extension and verified that instance variables are correctly typed now. The C extension is the same as present on [Issue#12150](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12150).\r\n\r\nC extension source code (only relevant part is present here, refer the [Issue#12150](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12150) for the complete source code.:\r\n```\r\ntypedef struct {\r\n    PyObject_HEAD\r\n    PyObject *var1; \r\n    PyObject *var2; \r\n    int
