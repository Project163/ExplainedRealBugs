Note also that this is somehow dependent on checks order. MRE without stdlib dependency:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypeIs\n\nclass A: ...\n\ndef is_a(o: object) -> TypeIs[type[A] | A]:\n    return isinstance(o, int)\n\nraw_target: object\n\nif is_a(raw_target) and isinstance(raw_target, type):\n    reveal_type(raw_target)  # N: Revealed type is \"builtins.type\"\nif isinstance(raw_target, type) and is_a(raw_target):\n    reveal_type(raw_target)  # N: Revealed type is \"Union[type[__main__.A], __main__.A]\"\n```\n\nhttps://mypy-play.net/?mypy=master&python=3.13&flags=strict&gist=6e2a57a00f5aa275ebbb2abbefa972e6\n</s>\n\nMy MRE exhibits the same behaviour on 1.15.0, so it isn't the same. And this is correct - `A` and `type` can have a common LSP-compatible subclass.\n\nThis issue bisects to #17678; `is_dataclass` is an overloaded function:\n\n```python\n# HACK: `obj: Never` typing matches if object argument is using `Any` type.\n@overload\ndef is_dataclass(obj: Never) -> TypeIs[DataclassInstance | type[DataclassInstance]]: ...  # type: ignore[narrowed-type-not-subtype]  # pyright: ignore[reportGeneralTypeIssues]\n@overload\ndef is_dataclass(obj: type) -> TypeIs[type[DataclassInstance]]: ...\n@overload\ndef is_dataclass(obj: object) -> TypeIs[DataclassInstance | type[DataclassInstance]]: ...\n```\n\nAnd this looks like a bug - after first `isinstance` we should have `raw_target` already narrowed to `type`, so the second overload should match.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2914435249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sterliakov","id":50529348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTI5MzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50529348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov","html_url":"https://github.com/sterliakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2914437564","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/19139#issuecomment-2914437564","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19139","id":2914437564,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc6ttsm8","user":{"login":"sterliakov","id":50529348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTI5MzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50529348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov","html_url":"https://github.com/sterliakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-27T23:34:57Z","updated_at":"2025-05-27T23:34:57Z","body":"@hauntsaninja
