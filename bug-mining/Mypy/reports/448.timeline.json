displayed. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe root cause seems to be this part of `pretty_callable`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/python/mypy/blob/a646f330641422d5bc9bf71d1f7751ab2d8a8d5d/mypy/messages.py#L2943-L2949\r\n\r\nThe relevant bit is the `isinstance(upper_bound, Instance)` check. This means that the bound for the type var is only displayed if it's a subtype of `Instance`, which [`CallableType`](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/a646f330641422d5bc9bf71d1f7751ab2d8a8d5d/mypy/types.py#L1798) is not. \r\n\r\nA quick fix would be to simply add a check for `CallableType`, as in:\r\n```diff\r\n          if isinstance(tvar, TypeVarType):\r\n              upper_bound = get_proper_type(tvar.upper_bound)\r\n              if (\r\n                  isinstance(upper_bound, Instance)\r\n                  and upper_bound.type.fullname != \"builtins.object\"\r\n-               ):\r\n+               ) or isinstance(upper_bound, CallableType):\r\n                  tvars.append(f\"{tvar.name}: {format_type_bare(upper_bound, options)}\")\r\n```\r\nwhich would change the output to\r\n```none\r\nmain.py:11: error: All conditional function variants must have identical signatures  [misc]\r\nmain.py:11: note: Original:\r\nmain.py:11: note:     def [F] f(a: F) -> F\r\nmain.py:11: note: Redefinition:\r\nmain.py:11: note:     def [F: Callable[..., Any]] f(a: F) -> F\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\nHowever, this wouldn't be a complete fix, since there are other `ProperType` (but not `Instance`) subtypes that should probably also be displayed as bounds. At a glance I think `UnionType`, `LiteralType`, `TupleType`, and `NoneType` all fall in this category, in addition to `CallableType`.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2362475434/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brianschubert","id":25313350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzEzMzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25313350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert","html_url":"https://github.com/brianschubert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"brianschubert","id":25313350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzEzMzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25313350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert","html_url":"https://github.com/brianschubert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-20T00:58:29Z","updated_at":"2024-09-20T00:58:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17791","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17791/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17791/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17791/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/17791","id":2537503280,"node_id":"I_kwDOAGuhRc6XPzow","number":17791,"title":"Error
