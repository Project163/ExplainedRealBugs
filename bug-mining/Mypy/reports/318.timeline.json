like I self-assigned this but then forgot about it. I'm happy to leave this to a sprint contributor.\r\n\r\nAs the author of assert_type(), I think it's reasonable for a type checker to fail on `assert_type(42, int)` if it infers 42 to be of type `Literal[42]`. `assert_type()` is meant to check that the types are exactly the same.\r\n\r\nmypy's current behavior is actually different from what this issue reports:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom typing_extensions import assert_type, Literal\r\n\r\nassert_type(42, int)  # passes\r\nassert_type(42, Literal[42]) # also passes\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this behavior is wrong: exactly one of these two should succeed, but not both. Which of the two is up to the type checker to decide. For both pyanalyze and pyright, `42` is inferred as type `Literal[42]` and therefore the first `assert_type` fails. Mypy could choose to instead infer `42` as being of type `int`, which would make the second assert fail instead.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1519080140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9087977699,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5K7brVzwAAAAIdr4jj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/9087977699","actor":{"login":"CarlFK","id":23225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK","html_url":"https://github.com/CarlFK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"06c1a613e2589ed7ea8585db48928c6ccfa24935","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/CarlFK/mypy/commits/06c1a613e2589ed7ea8585db48928c6ccfa24935","created_at":"2023-04-25T04:56:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"CarlFK","id":23225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK","html_url":"https://github.com/CarlFK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CarlFK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-25T05:02:38Z","updated_at":"2023-04-25T05:02:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15123","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15123/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15123/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15123/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15123","id":1682432521,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGuhRc5PEJQN","number":15123,"title":"Use source_type.last_known_value when Instance.
