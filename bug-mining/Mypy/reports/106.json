Consider code like this:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom typing import Any, Optional\r\n\r\ndef test(**kwargs):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nkwargs: Optional[Any]\r\ntest(**kwargs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, this is obviously wrong on purpose, and in latest MyPy, results in this error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: Argument after ** must be a mapping\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with this message is that, it doesn't say what exactly is wrong, unlike when you normally mismatch types where it says: `Argument 1 to \"test\" has incompatible type \"Union[int, str]\"; expected \"bool\"`, for example. In my case, I had a variable with the same name inferring `Optional[Any]` higher up in the code, and tracking down the root cause took me good 10 minutes,\r\n\r\n**Pitch**\r\n\r\nEven though `**kwargs` usage like this is uncommon, having a similarly improved message would help with debugging why this may be happening. Something like: `Argument after ** to \"test\" has incompatible type \"Union[Any, None]\", expected \"Mapping[str, Any]\"` should help a lot.","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12070/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
