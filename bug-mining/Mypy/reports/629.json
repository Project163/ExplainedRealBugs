Only `type T = dict` seems to wrongly pass.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n```python\ntype T = dict\nx: T = T()\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\n```shell\n$ mypy t.py\nt.py:2: error: \"TypeAliasType\" not callable  [operator]\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n```\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\n```shell\n$ mypy t.py\nSuccess: no issues found in 1 source file\n```\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n- Mypy version used: `mypy 1.17.1 (compiled: yes)`\n- Mypy command-line flags: `mypy`\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): None\n- Python version used: `Python 3.13.5`","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19698/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19698/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
