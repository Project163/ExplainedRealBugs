One reason for this is that missing stubs cause many `Any` types to be inferred, and these may trigger additional errors, depending on the strictness options being used.\r\n\r\nOne way to address this is to use some heuristic to silence errors that are *not* about missing stubs after a threshold. For example, if we've reported N errors about missing stubs and at least M errors overall, hide any remaining errors that are not about stubs.\r\n\r\nThis could be a significant issue for some users after the next mypy release (0.900), which unbundles stubs for third-party libraries. Thus users are likely to see errors about missing stubs as soon they update to mypy 0.900.","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10529/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
