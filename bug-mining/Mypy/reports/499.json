I've noticed on first check, or when checking a large number of files it will take a few dozen seconds to return (expected for my large repo). However, when I do `dmypy status` on it during this time, I see \r\n\r\n```\r\nerror                   :  timed out\r\nDaemon is stuck; consider /usr/scratch/pthompson/junk/ops3venv11/bin/dmypy kill\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't think this is correct. It's not \"stuck\", it's just busy and I'm fairly confident it will return an answer eventually. But I think this means `dmypy run` will attempt to start another daemon during this time (if I spam it with a for loop I can get into a funky state); and it might be harder to build tooling around a `check`/`start`/`stop` flow. Is there a way to get a better status than this?","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18008/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
