you for your clarifications. I don't agree that the issue should be closed, as this still looks to me like a documentation issue. I will give some additional context to clarify my point of view.\r\n\r\nI see how my Python 3.8 testing methodology was flawed from @hauntsaninja's comment (and thus why it worked when I tested it with Python 3.8). However:\r\n\r\n1) I agree with @JelleZijlstra's remark that it would be useful to clarify that error message to reflect the actual potential error states it represents\r\n2) Since I was 100% positive I had that package in my current environment, and I had read on the documentation that's what was needed (and the note is not suggesting anything different), it seemed pointless to me to run `mypy --install-types app.py` - so I didn't. The link contained in the note wasn't even about my specific issue, so it didn't help convincing me to do that.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installed_packages.html), which is what I was referring to in point (2), the following is mentioned:\r\n\r\n> Typically mypy will automatically find and use installed packages that support type checking or provide stubs. This requires that you install the packages in the Python environment that you use to run mypy.\r\n\r\nThe way I understand this, and I don't think it's unreasonable, is: you need the stubs in the venv where you're running mypy from.
