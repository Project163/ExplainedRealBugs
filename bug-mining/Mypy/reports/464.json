If `--shadow-file` uses a `SHADOW_FILE` which is longer than `SOURCE_FILE`, mypy crashes as it tries to access a line which doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce & Traceback**\r\n\r\n`a.py`\r\n```python\r\nb: bytes  # Ensure there is at most 1 newline character in this file\r\n```\r\n`b.py`\r\n```python\r\na: int = \"\"\r\nb: bytes = 1\r\n```\r\n```shell\r\n$ mypy a.py --pretty --shadow-file a.py b.py\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  ...\r\n  File \"<virtual environment>\\lib\\site-packages\\mypy\\__main__.py\", line 15, in console_entry\r\n    main()\r\n  File \"mypy\\main.py\", line 103, in main\r\n  File \"mypy\\main.py\", line 187, in run_build\r\n  File \"mypy\\build.py\", line 193, in build\r\n  File \"mypy\\build.py\", line 268, in _build\r\n  File \"mypy\\build.py\", line 2950, in dispatch\r\n  File \"mypy\\build.py\", line 3348, in process_graph\r\n  File \"mypy\\build.py\", line 3471, in process_stale_scc\r\n  File \"mypy\\errors.py\", line 923, in file_messages\r\n  File \"mypy\\errors.py\", line 883, in format_messages\r\nIndexError: list index out of range\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/python/mypy/blob/1a2c8e2a4df21532e4952191cad74ae50083f4ad/mypy/errors.py#L883\r\n\r\nI think the solution is to insert source file fragments from `SHADOW_FILE` rather than `SOURCE_FILE`. Even if this doesn't crash, the resultant messages don't make sense. For example, inserting extra newlines into `a.py` prevents the crash but you get\r\n```shell\r\na.py:1:10:1:11: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"str\", variable has type \"int\")  [assignment]\r\n    b: bytes\r\n            ^\r\na.py:2:12:2:12: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"int\", variable has type \"bytes\")  [assignment]\r\n    \r\n       ^\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 1.11.2\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: `--pretty --shadow-file`\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): None\r\n- Python version used: 3.9\r\n- Operating system and version: Windows 11 Home","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17853/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17853/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
