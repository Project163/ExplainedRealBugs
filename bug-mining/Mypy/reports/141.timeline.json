Description\r\n\"Fixes #12508\" \r\n\r\nThe initial error is that the Checking sum(*1) produces \"error: List or tuple expected as variable arguments\". But it’s a variadic argument so should be acceptable. We fix that issue so it won’t produce an error in this case.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\nAfter noticing the issue, we tracked down the code which reports “List or tuple expected as variable arguments”. We found that some test cases contained something like f(*a) which shouldn’t be reported as an error. \r\n\r\nThen, we tracked the error message and found that it was within “check_argument_types”. Within that function, there was an if statement to check whether the actual_kind = node.ASG.STAR and the argument type is not valid argument. \r\nThere are only two circumstances that fit the requirement in the test case: f(*a) and f(a, *a). We evaluated the first one to be acceptable but the second one contains an error. \r\n\r\nIn this case, we check the length of those types and only let the function produce an error when there are multiple arguments passed in.\r\n\r\nFor test cases, we may fail some of them since the original test cases have some problems (false positive). And we delete those incorrect test cases correspondingly. After that, we pass all the remaining test cases.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1087969603","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12508#issuecomment-1087969603","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12508","id":1087969603,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5A2RlD","user":{"login":"cmcgee0308","id":99448395,"node_id":"U_kgDOBe12Sw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99448395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcgee0308","html_url":"https://github.com/cmcgee0308","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcgee0308/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcgee0308/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcgee0308/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcgee0308/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcgee0308/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcgee0308/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcgee0308/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcgee0308/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmcgee0308/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-04T20:14:50Z","updated_at":"2022-04-04T20:14:50Z","body":"Hi there!
