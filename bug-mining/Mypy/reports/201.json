You can also do this on the command-line, by simply listing the files.\r\n\r\nIf you want MyPy to check an entire module or package, you can do so on the command line (with `-m` or `-p`), but there is no way to do this in a config file.  Since it is possible to set `files` in config files, I think it should also be possible to set `module` and `package`.  (I am suggesting not-plural names \"module\" and \"package\" to match the command-line arguments).\r\n\r\nOne question you might ask is \"Why don't you just list the directory containing your modules/packages?\"  In my case, doing so gives me an error like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/namespace1/namespace2/package1/file.py: error: Source file found twice under different module names: `package2` and `namespace1.namespace2.package2`\r\n```\r\n\r\n… or an error like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/namespace1/namespace2/package1/__init.py__:NN: error: Skipping analyzing \"namespace1\": found module but no type hints of library stubs\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of my code is in the `src` directory.  In my `pyproject.toml`, I have `namespace_packages = true` and `mypy_path = [\"src\"]`.  The above error only happens if I try to specify a file or directory to check.  If instead I use `-p namespace1` (or `-p namespace1.namespace2`), everything is located, loaded, and typechecked successfully.","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10728/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
