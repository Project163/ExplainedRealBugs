Description\r\n\r\nI _think_ this PR gets rid of all the errors in #11887 -- but I'm not sure #11887 should be closed, as this will only fix the issue for stub files. Cyclic imports are likely to be far more common in typeshed than elsewhere, though, so it may still be worthwhile. (Other users of mypy may also find it easier to make use of PEP 613, as well, whereas typeshed is currently unable to do so — see #4913.)\r\n\r\nEssentially, the error in #11887 is caused by mypy being unable to tell whether a `|` expression represents a type alias for a union-type, or some other arbitrary runtime object. But the problem just doesn't exist for `.pyi` stub files, because there _are_ no arbitrary runtime objects. An expression using the bitwise `|` operator in a stub file can _only_ be a type alias.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nManual testing confirms that this gets rid of all the reported errors in #11887.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how to create a regression test for this kind of thing -- any guidance on that would be hugely appreciated!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11915/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11915/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1025247613","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11098#issuecomment-1025247613","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11098","id":1025247613,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc49HAl9","user":{"login":"AlexWaygood","id":66076021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDc2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66076021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexWaygood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-30T22:32:06Z","updated_at":"2022-01-30T22:32:06Z","body":"> Could potentially be fixed by #11915.
