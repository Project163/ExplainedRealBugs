I noticed this as I was going over typeshed stubtest exceptions, specifically for itertools.accumulate.\r\nTests for python 3.6 and 3.7 failed because the stubs declared accumulate as a function while it was actually a class. However for 3.8 it is defined as two functions with overload and the tests passed successfully.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n1. Run stubtest for typeshed in python 3.8.\r\n2. Test passes.\r\n3. Remove one of the overloads in itertools.pyi\r\n4. run again and see it fails.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nI t should fail on a type mismatch like it does for no overloads.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\nRan from latest python 3.8 and latest mypy from github.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10254/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10254/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
