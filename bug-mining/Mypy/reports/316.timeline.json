#15110 \r\n\r\n- Add PYTHONSAFEPATH=\"true\" to call to subprocess in get_search_dirs()\r\n- Check sys.version_info before modifying path in pyinfo.py \r\n\r\nTo test, import mypy.modulefinder.get_search_dirs & run:\r\n- get_search_dirs() with no args\r\n- on Python 3.11, call get_search_dirs with an earlier version as python_executable\r\n- on Python < 3.11, call get_search_dirs with Python 3.11 as python_executable\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n- consistent results, no exceptions\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nChecklist:\r\n- Read the [Contributing
