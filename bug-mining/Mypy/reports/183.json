It helps solving metaclass conflict error.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom djang.db.models import ModelBase\r\nfrom abc import ABCMeta\r\n\r\nclass AbstractModel(ABCMeta, ModelBase): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr any other existing metaclass.\r\n\r\nBut, mypy treats `ABCMeta` and `AbstractModel` differently:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod\r\nfrom typing import Protocol\r\n\r\nclass A:  # OK, has @abstractmethod\r\n    @abstractmethod\r\n    def f(self) -> None:\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n# Expected:\r\nclass B(A):  # E: Class a.B has abstract attributes \"f\"  # N: If it is meant to be abstract, add 'abc.ABCMeta' as an explicit metaclass\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nclass C(A, metaclass=ABCMeta):  # OK, has ABCMeta as a metaclass\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nclass CustomABC(ABCMeta):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\n# Unexpected:\r\nclass D(A, metaclass=CustomABC):  # E: Class a.D has abstract attributes \"f\"  # N: If it is meant to be abstract, add 'abc.ABCMeta' as an explicit metaclass\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that needs to be fixed.","closed_by":{"login":"sobolevn","id":4660275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjAyNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4660275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn","html_url":"https://github.com/sobolevn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13561/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13561/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
