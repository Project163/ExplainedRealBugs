Searching the codebase for an interesting `hasattr`, we find a `hasattr` call in [`replace_object_state`](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/mypy/util.py#L400-L403). This results in possibly calling `hasattr` on `OverloadedFuncDef.setter`, which evaluates the property unconditionally (since `hasattr` is implemented using `getattr` [[1]](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#hasattr)), triggering the `assert` on [`mypy/nodes.py:615`](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/v1.16.1/mypy/nodes.py#L615).\n\nMain uses of `replace_object_state` are in [`mypy/server/astmerge.py`](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/v1.16.1/mypy/server/astmerge.py).\n\nAssuming the above I tried to create a reproducer. Which indeed made it reproducable:\n\n```console\n$ mkdir /tmp/hello\n$ cd /tmp/hello\n$ uv init\n$ uv add mypy==1.16.1\n$ cat >test.py <<EOL\nfrom typing import Literal, overload\n\n@overload\ndef a(x: Literal[1]) -> int: ...\n\n@overload\ndef a(x: Literal[\"a\"]) -> str: ...\n\n@overload\ndef a(x: Literal[\"b\"]) -> str: ...\n\ndef a(x: Literal[1, \"a\", \"b\"]) -> int | str:\n    return x\nEOL\n$ uv run dmypy run test.py\nDaemon started\nSuccess: no issues found in 1 source file\n$ cat >test.py <<EOL\nfrom typing import Literal, overload\n\n@overload\ndef a(x: Literal[1]) -> int: ...\n\n@overload\ndef a(x: Literal[\"a\"]) -> str: ...\n\ndef a(x: Literal[1, \"a\"]) -> int | str:\n    return x\nEOL\n$ uv run dmypy run test.py\nException ignored in PyObject_HasAttr(); consider using PyObject_HasAttrWithError(), PyObject_GetOptionalAttr() or PyObject_GetAttr():\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 615, in setter\nAssertionError: \nException ignored in PyObject_HasAttr(); consider using PyObject_HasAttrWithError(), PyObject_GetOptionalAttr() or PyObject_GetAttr():\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 615, in setter\nAssertionError: \nException ignored in PyObject_HasAttr(); consider using PyObject_HasAttrWithError(), PyObject_GetOptionalAttr() or PyObject_GetAttr():\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 615, in setter\nAssertionError: \nException ignored in PyObject_HasAttr(); consider using PyObject_HasAttrWithError(), PyObject_GetOptionalAttr() or PyObject_GetAttr():\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 615, in setter\nAssertionError: \nSuccess: no issues found in 1 source file\n\n$ ... cycling between the versions of `test.py` consistently reproduces the error.\n```\n\nWe probably want `OverloadedFuncDef.setter` to not be a `@property`, s.t. it is not evaluated by `hasattr`?
