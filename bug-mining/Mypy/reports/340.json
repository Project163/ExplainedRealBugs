Add equivalent of `CheckerPluginInterface.accept` for ad-hoc type resolution (i.e. current solution but w/o private API). The assumption is that this will not normally be used by hook authors except in specific cases for specific args (since doing it generally creates a chicken-and-egg problem, as `infer_arg_types_in_context` gets the callee after the hook's mutation).\r\n2. Pass actual arg types to **function sig hook**. Not sure it'll be doable, since as I mentioned `infer_arg_types_in_context` depends on `callee` (after hook's mutation).\r\n3. Change **function hook** to allow returning not only a ret_type but also arg_types/kinds/names. This means that in those cases checks will be done twice: it first has to pass old formal sig, then (if plugin returns one) it has to pass the new formal sig.\r\n\r\nPlease advise :)\r\n\r\nP.S. Same applies to method signature hook.","closed_by":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14845/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14845/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
