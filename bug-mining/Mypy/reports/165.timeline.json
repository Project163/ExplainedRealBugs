I'm sorry that mypy's been doing a such a shoddy job here. There's an element of mypy's module finding logic with respect to namespace packages that is stateful and is the root cause of all this repeated pain. In Guido's words, four years ago: https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/5016#pullrequestreview-119964669. I'll see if there's yet another small patch that will fix, but I think this might be hard to make bulletproof and be confident about until we rip out that stateful logic. At least test suite will prevent regressions :-)","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1178036945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1178057628","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13085#issuecomment-1178057628","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13085","id":1178057628,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5GN7uc","user":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-07T18:39:05Z","updated_at":"2022-07-07T18:39:05Z","body":"Okay, I have a patch that fixes this.

Report**\r\n\r\n`module google.cloud has no attribute firestore`\r\nThe bug is that this statement is not true.\r\n\r\nThere have been a few related stackoverflow issues (e.g. [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63339732/module-google-cloud-has-no-attribute-storage), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55212535/issue-with-google-cloud-storage-module-has-no-attribute-client/55212631#55212631)) relating to incorrect \"module x as no attribute y\" specifically relating to google.cloud.\r\nSome issues were sorted by recreating the virtual env.\r\nOther issues on this repo were historically traced back to using incremental mode but solution seemed incomplete (e.g. [1](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10360), [2](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12232)).\r\nWe disabled mypy cache (e.g. incremental mode) which dealt with a chunk of the problem\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nHard to know exactly how to reproduce because the problem with this issue is it seems random and indeterministic - even after disabling incremental mode.\r\n\r\nAll I can tell you is in our code we do:\r\n```python\r\nfrom google.cloud import bigquery, firestore\r\n```\r\nBoth `google-cloud-bigquery` and `google-cloud-firestore` are in setup.cfg/requirements.txt and installed in the virtual environment which mypy is being activated from.\r\n\r\nWe have no issues (currently) with the bigquery import but we do with firestore. They are completely identical for all intents and purposes here.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behaviour**\r\n\r\nNo complaint about missing attribute.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behaviour**\r\n\r\nIncorrect complaint about missing attribute.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\nmypy 0.950 (compiled: yes)\r\npython 3.9.x\r\n\r\nPlease can we get to the bottom of this once and for all?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12985/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12985/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-15T02:23:31Z","updated_at":"2022-07-15T02:23:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13124","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13124/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13124/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13124/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/13124","id":1305491270,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGuhRc47cVZ5","number":13124,"title":"Fix

a local file which uses something which is a namespace package and then another local file which uses the first one, there's an intermittent bug where the namespace packaged module's types aren't found.\r\nThis seems likely similar to https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/7276, however even with https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/10937 in place (i.e: on a more recent mypy release) the issue remains.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n``` shell\r\n$ mkdir demo\r\n$ echo 'import ruamel.yaml' > demo/wrapper.py \r\n$ echo 'import wrapper' > demo/consumer.py\r\n```\r\n``` shell\r\n$ mypy demo  # first run\r\nSuccess: no issues found in 2 source files\r\n```\r\n``` shell\r\n$ mypy demo  # second run\r\ndemo/wrapper.py:1: error: Skipping analyzing \"ruamel\": module is installed, but missing library stubs or py.typed marker\r\ndemo/consumer.py:1: error: Skipping analyzing \"ruamel\": module is installed, but missing library stubs or py.typed marker\r\ndemo/consumer.py:1: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#missing-imports\r\nFound 2 errors in 2 files (checked 2 source files)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSubsequent runs will alternate between success and failure. Any additional source files in the project (whether they import the `wrapper` or not) will also have the error message applied to them, which makes failing runs vastly less useful.\r\n\r\nRunning with `--no-incremental` appears to avoid the issue; I can run several times in a row with `--no-incremental` without encountering the failure mode (and have not seen it with that flag enabled).\r\n\r\nRunning with `--namespace-packages` appears to have no effect.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately as `ruamel.yaml` is a typed library, ignoring the imports with `type: ignore[import]` ends up generating more errors as the ignores appear unused on a \"successful\" run (and you have `warn_unused_ignores` enabled).\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Setup & versions</summary>\r\n\r\n``` shell\r\npython3.9 -m venv venv\r\n. venv/bin/activate\r\npip install -U pip setuptools wheel\r\npip install mypy ruamel.yaml\r\n```\r\n``` shell\r\n$ pip list\r\nPackage           Version\r\n----------------- -------\r\nmypy              0.942\r\nmypy-extensions   0.4.3\r\npip               22.0.4\r\nruamel.yaml       0.17.21\r\nruamel.yaml.clib  0.2.6\r\nsetuptools        62.1.0\r\ntomli             2.0.1\r\ntyping_extensions 4.2.0\r\nwheel             0.37.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 0.942\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: see above\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): none\r\n- Python version used: 3.9 (though similar behaviour observed on other versions; at least on 3.8)\r\n- Operating system and version: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12664/reactions","total_count":29,"+1":26,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12664/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
