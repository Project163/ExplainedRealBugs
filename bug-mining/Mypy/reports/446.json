you're not sure whether what you're experiencing is a mypy bug, please see the \"Question and Help\" form instead.\r\nPlease consider:\r\n\r\n- checking our common issues page: https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html\r\n- searching our issue tracker: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues to see if it's already been reported\r\n- asking on gitter chat: https://gitter.im/python/typing\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Bug Report**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're reporting a problem with a specific library function, the typeshed tracker is better suited for this report: https://github.com/python/typeshed/issues\r\n\r\nIf the project you encountered the issue in is open source, please provide a link to the project.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUsing the `type` statement with an annotated type results in a invalid type alias error.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nannotated.py:\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Annotated, TypeAlias\r\n\r\n\r\nclass MyAnnotation:\r\n    pass\r\n\r\n\r\n# Works:\r\n# MyInt: TypeAlias = Annotated[int, MyAnnotation()]\r\n\r\n# Causes Invalid type alias: expression is not a valid type  [valid-type]\r\ntype MyInt = Annotated[int, MyAnnotation()]\r\n\r\n\r\nclass MyModel:\r\n    value: MyInt\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nI expect the type statement to behave the same as the commented-out manual type alias that works.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n```\r\nannotated.py:8: error: Invalid type alias: expression is not a valid type  [valid-type]\r\n    type MyInt = Annotated[int, MyAnnotation()]\r\n                 ^\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n-
