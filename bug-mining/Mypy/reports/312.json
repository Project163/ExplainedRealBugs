this seems like a significant regression.\r\n\r\nWhile mypy 0.990 is running, I see 100% usage on 1 CPU.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nShould be as simple as cloning pydantic, checkout that branch (`uprev-mypy`), install requirements from `requirements/linting.txt`, run mypy.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: `0.990`\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: just `mypy pydantic`\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): see [this bit of `pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/blob/aea7016e6cbc7c589713e9ffb7891316d9cde262/pyproject.toml#L155-L187)\r\n- Python version used:3.10.0 (just realised how old my version of 3.10 is, I've upgraded to 3.10.8, same result)\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14034/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
