Description\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11157\r\n\r\nFor `--warn-unused-ignored`, currently `Errors.used_ignored_lines` keeps track of only the line numbers without error codes when errors appeares on the line with `# type: ignore` or `# type: ignore[...]`.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `used_ignored_lines` so that it also keeps track of error codes and that information used in `generate_unused_ignore_errors` to show an error message like `unused \"type: ignore[attr-defined]\" comment`.\r\n\r\nI'm very new to mypy code base and one thing I'm not so confident about my change is that I might be using `MISC` error codes in an unintended way.\r\nPlease let me know if this approach is correct and I appreciate any feedback.\r\nThank for the review!\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nThere are some tests using `--warn-unused-ignores`, but this PR didn't change the result of those tests. So, I added a few test named `testErrorCodeWarnUnusedIgnores` in `test-data/unit/check-errorcodes.test` which have different behavior between this PR and current master.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11178/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5355362858,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc47vADSzwAAAAE_NFoq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/5355362858","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-24T11:00:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5355363225,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc47vADSzwAAAAE_NFuZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/5355363225","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8b47a032e1317fb8e3f9a818005a6b63e9bf0311","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/8b47a032e1317fb8e3f9a818005a6b63e9bf0311","created_at":"2021-09-24T11:00:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
