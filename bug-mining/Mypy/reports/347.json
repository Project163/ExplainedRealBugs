now `mypy` does not support proper `__post_init__` signatures.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dataclasses\r\n\r\n@dataclasses.dataclass\r\nclass My:\r\n    x: int\r\n    y: dataclasses.InitVar[str] = 'a'\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor now, `mypy` will allow a lot of incorrect code to slip in:\r\n- `def __post_init__(self, y: str) -> str: ...`, which needs to return `None`\r\n- `def __post_init__(self, y: int) -> None: ...`, which has incorrect type for `y`\r\n- `def __post_init__(self) -> None: ...`, which has no `y`\r\n- `def __post_init__(self, x: int, y: str) -> None: ...`, which has extra `x` param\r\n\r\n**Pitch**\r\n\r\nWe can easily support this feature and make sure that `__post_init__` signature is always correct for a dataclass.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sobolevn","id":4660275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjAyNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4660275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn","html_url":"https://github.com/sobolevn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15498/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15498/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
