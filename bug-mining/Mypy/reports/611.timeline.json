clear?\n\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/3097072642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"LefterisJP","id":1658405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTg0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1658405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LefterisJP","html_url":"https://github.com/LefterisJP","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LefterisJP/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LefterisJP/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LefterisJP/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LefterisJP/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LefterisJP/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LefterisJP/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LefterisJP/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LefterisJP/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LefterisJP/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"sterliakov","id":50529348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTI5MzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50529348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov","html_url":"https://github.com/sterliakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-21T15:20:28Z","updated_at":"2025-07-21T15:20:28Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19485","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19485/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19485/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19485/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/19485","id":3249082340,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGuhRc6f4NyB","number":19485,"title":"Retain

What's in this Change?\r\n\r\nhttps://alleninstitute.atlassian.net/browse/DT-8265\r\n\r\nThis change introduces pydantic (v2) backed data models. We implement that same `aibs_informatics_core.models.base.ModelBase` protocol that `SchemaModel` implements. \r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n- I've added pydantic as an optional dependency which allows us to smoothly transition to using it. I envision a major version update that removes the `SchemaModel` entirely and replaces it with the pydantic based model. \r\n- I have added a few annotated types (akin to marshmallows custom fields) and de-/serializers to help with converting things like iso formatted datetime strings and custom str class fields correctly  \r\n\r\n### Commits:\r\n- **initial changes to add pydantic v2 support**\r\n- **fix get_version test**\r\n- **make pydantic optional dependency, isolate pydantic imports**\r\n- **add tests for new pydantic models**\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- added unit tests for the pydantic model\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- verified that the install with no pydantic does not create issues\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn [1]: from aibs_informatics_core.models.aws.s3 import S3URI\r\n\r\nIn [2]: from aibs_informatics_core.models.base import PydanticBaseModel\r\nUnexpected exception formatting exception.

What's in this Change?\r\n\r\nthere is a bug in the `S3Path.parent` property when the path ends with a trailing slash. \r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [1]: from aibs_informatics_core.models.aws.s3 import S3URI\r\n\r\nIn [2]: x = S3URI(\"s3://mybucket/myfolder/mykey/\")\r\n\r\nIn [3]: x.parent\r\nOut[3]: 's3://mybucket/myfolder/mykey/'\r\n\r\nIn [4]: x.parent.parent\r\nOut[4]: 's3://mybucket/myfolder/mykey/'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fix ensurest the following behavior:\r\n1. the true parent will be returned for any non empty string, regardless of trailing slash\r\n2. for an empty key, the same root will be returned (parent of `s3://bucket/` -> `s3://bucket/`)  \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nadded unit tests\r\n\r\n(note that a bug in mypy 17.0 is causing mypy failures
