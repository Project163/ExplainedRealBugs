#10244\r\nFixes #13515 \r\n\r\nThis fixes only the crash part, I am going to fix also the embarrassing type variable clash in a separate PR, since it is completely unrelated issue.\r\n\r\nThe crash happens because solver can call `is_suptype()` on the constraint bounds, and those can contain `<Erased>`. Then if it is a generic callable type (e.g. `def [S] (S) -> T` when used as a context is erased to `def [S] (S) -> <Erased>`), `is_subtype()` will try unifying them, causing the crash when applying unified arguments.\r\n\r\nMy fix is to simply allow subtyping between callable types that contain `<Erased>`, we anyway allow checking subtpying between all other types with `<Erased>` components. And this technically can be useful, e.g. `[T <: DerivedGen1[<Erased>], T <: DerivedGen2[<Erased>]]` will be solved as `T <: NonGenBase`.\r\n\r\nBtw this crash technically has nothing to do with dataclasses, but it looks like there is no other way in mypy to define a callable with generic callable as argument type, if I try:\r\n```python\r\ndef foo(x: Callable[[S], T]) -> T: ...\r\n```\r\nto repro the crash, mypy instead interprets `foo` as `def [S, T] (x: Callable[[S], T]) -> T`, i.e. the argument type is not generic. I also tried callback protocols, but they also don't repro the crash (at least I can't find a repro), because protocols use variance for subtyping, before actually checking member types.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14093/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14093/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-14T22:37:18Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T22:37:18Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14095","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14095/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14095/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14095/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14095","id":1448871449,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGuhRc5C4bbj","number":14095,"title":"Fix

the non-crash part of #10244 (and similar situations).\r\n\r\nThe `freshen_function_type_vars()` use in `checkmember.py` was inconsistent:\r\n* It needs to be applied to attributes too, not just methods\r\n* It needs to be a visitor, since generic callable can appear in a nested position\r\n\r\nThe downsides are ~2% performance regression, and people will see more large ids in `reveal_type()` (since refreshing functions uses a global unique counter). But since this is a correctness issue that can cause really bizarre error messages, I think it is totally worth it.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14095/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14095/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7818585629,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc4yH1TnzwAAAAHSBiYd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7818585629","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-16T00:02:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7818585917,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc4yH1TnzwAAAAHSBic9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7818585917","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7d0d1d9d505869d55ee71e370941a8a47122087e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/7d0d1d9d505869d55ee71e370941a8a47122087e","created_at":"2022-11-16T00:02:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7828168222,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc4yH1TnzwAAAAHSmF4e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7828168222","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"48c4a47c457b03caf00be2e2dacd91c3635cdc90","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/48c4a47c457b03caf00be2e2dacd91c3635cdc90","created_at":"2022-11-16T21:39:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
