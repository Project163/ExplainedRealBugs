might be worth pointing out that mypy doesn't get the behaviour precisely correct on Python <=3.10 either:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom enum import Enum\r\n\r\nclass Foo(Enum):\r\n    BAR = 'bar'\r\n    BAZ = 'baz'\r\n\r\nreveal_type(Foo.name)  # No error from mypy, raises AttributeError at runtime\r\nreveal_type(Foo.value)  # No error from mypy, raises AttributeError at runtime\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Python <= 3.10, `Enum.name` and `Enum.value` are special-cased by the `enum` module to allow this magical behaviour, where `name` and `value` are read-only properties that raise `AttributeError` if accessed from the class rather than an instance. This is to allow enumerations where members have `name` or `value` as their names:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from enum import Enum\r\n>>> class Dictionary(Enum):\r\n...     name = 'a word used to identify something'\r\n...     animal = 'a living creature'\r\n...\r\n>>> Dictionary.name\r\n<Dictionary.name: 'a word used to identify something'>\r\n>>> Dictionary.name.name\r\n'name'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Python 3.11, `name` and `value` are no longer special-cased by the `enum` module. Instead, the new `enum.property` class generalises this behaviour, so that users can create their own \"magic enum properties\":\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import enum\r\n>>> class CustomEnum(enum.Enum):\r\n...     @enum.property\r\n...     def foo(self):\r\n...         return 'MAGIC'\r\n...\r\n>>> class MyEnum(CustomEnum):\r\n...     foo = 'foo'\r\n...\r\n>>> MyEnum.foo\r\n<MyEnum.foo: 'foo'>\r\n>>>

following mypy bug but means that it can't really be used idiomatically at the moment:\r\n\r\n- #12787\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`StrEnum`: I didn't think this required any special treatment from mypy, but

this is proper place to report, as I have experienced another issue related to `Enum.name` behaviour after upgrading my codebase to Python 3.11 (and latest mypy 0.991).\r\n\r\nWith Python 3.10 following code checked OK,\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom enum import Enum, unique\r\n\r\n\r\n@unique\r\nclass SortEnum(Enum):\r\n     name = \"name\"\r\n     name_desc = \"-name\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ pipx run mypy==0.991 --python-version=3.10 test.py\r\nSuccess: no issues found in 1 source file\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut with Python 3.11 it throwing,\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ pipx run mypy==0.991 --python-version=3.11 test.py\r\ntest.py:6:12: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"str\", base class \"Enum\" defined the type as \"Callable[[Enum], str]\")  [assignment]\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a quick workaround it might be possible to rename `SortEnum.name` to `SortEnum.name_asc`, and in meantime looking forward to proper fix 🙏
