one when duck typing 2 different typed dict:\r\n\r\nLet's say that I have a function `foo` that expect a `Small` TypedDict as parameter\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Small(TypedDict):\r\n    a: NotRequired[str]\r\n\r\ndef foo(small: Small) -> None: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this `Small` TypedDict the field `a` is marked as `NotRequired`.\r\n\r\nElsewere I have another `Big` TypedDict with 2 fields `a`, and `b`, both required.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Big(TypedDict):\r\n    a: str\r\n    b: str\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut if I try to pass a `Big` dict instance to my `foo` function, mypy mark it as an error:\r\n`main.py:21: error: Argument 1 to \"foo\" has incompatible type \"Big\"; expected \"Small\"  [arg-type]`\r\n\r\nIf I change the type of `Big.a` to a `NotRequired[str]`, mypy is happy, however mypy should allow the original definition, as a \"normal\" field should be treated as a stricter, \"smaller\" version of a not required one\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
