Fixes #19335.\r\n\r\n<!-- If this pull request fixes an issue, add \"Fixes #NNN\" with the issue number. -->\r\n\r\nThis is done by changing how `find_node` works slightly, allowing there to be at most two colon (`:`) characters in the passed key for windows machines instead of just one like on all other platforms, and then using `rsplit` and a split limit of 1 instead of just `split` like prior.\r\n\r\nI was looking at the existing tests for dmypy suggest and noticed nothing is testing absolute paths for any platform, so I am unsure what I need to do to add tests;
