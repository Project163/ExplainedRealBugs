This happens when using the `--package` option, but not when passing the directory path.\r\n\r\n**Traceback**\r\n\r\n```\r\nversion: 1.13.0\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/home/mambaforge/envs/test-mypy/bin/mypy\", line 8, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(console_entry())\r\n             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^\r\n  File \"/Users/home/mambaforge/envs/test-mypy/lib/python3.13/site-packages/mypy/__main__.py\", line 15, in console_entry\r\n    main()\r\n    ~~~~^^\r\n  File \"mypy/main.py\", line 102, in main\r\n  File \"mypy/main.py\", line 186, in run_build\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 194, in build\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 269, in _build\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 2935, in dispatch\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 3333, in process_graph\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 3438, in process_stale_scc\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 2397, in finish_passes\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 873, in report_file\r\n  File \"mypy/report.py\", line 91, in file\r\n  File \"mypy/report.py\", line 426, in on_file\r\nIsADirectoryError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/Users/home/mambaforge/envs/test-mypy/lib/python3.13/site-packages/test_package/data'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1.
