#17023 \r\n\r\nStubtest should only mangle positional-only parameter names if they're positional-only in all branches of the overload. The signatures get really ugly and wrong otherwise.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I did the new `test_overload_signature` in the best way. I couldn't figure out a way to get covert a string into a `nodes.OverloadedFuncDef` object with any of the techniques in existing tests in `teststubtest.py`. Maybe the new test case is sufficient, but I wanted to test the signature generation directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19297547809,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc6CRLHXzwAAAAR-OTYh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/19297547809","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-23T01:12:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19297547824,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc6CRLHXzwAAAAR-OTYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/19297547824","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f51b6995353626a56b8ae7cf078ef28119ae5eb5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/f51b6995353626a56b8ae7cf078ef28119ae5eb5","created_at":"2025-08-23T01:12:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
