the members list.\n\nThe simplest repro where this is a problem:\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum, member\nfrom typing import reveal_type\n\nclass Pet(Enum):\n    CAT = 1\n\n    @member\n    def human(self) -> int:\n        return 2\n\ndef a(x: Pet) -> None:\n    if x is not Pet.CAT:\n        reveal_type(x) \n```\n\nWith `--warn-unreachable` it will produce:\n\n```\nex.py:13: note: Revealed type is \"enum.member[def (self: ex.Pet) -> builtins.int]\"\nex.py:18: error: Statement is unreachable  [unreachable]\n```\n\nBecause `.enum_members` here will only contain `CAT`:

fix.","closed_by":{"login":"sobolevn","id":4660275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjAyNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4660275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn","html_url":"https://github.com/sobolevn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18557/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
