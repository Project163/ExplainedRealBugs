everybody knows not to write\r\n`def foo(arg={'bar': 'baz'}):`\r\n\r\nSo instead one usually writes something like:\r\n```\r\ndef foo(arg=None):\r\n    if arg is None:\r\n        arg = {'bar', 'baz'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow add some types:\r\n```\r\ndef func(arg=None):\r\n    # type: (Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str,str]\r\n    reveal_type(arg)  # Revealed type is 'Union[builtins.dict[builtins.str, builtins.str], builtins.None]'\r\n    if arg is None:\r\n        arg = {'foo': 'bar'}\r\n    reveal_type(arg)  #  Revealed type is 'builtins.dict[builtins.str, builtins.str]'\r\n    return arg\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo all is good, unless you try to create an inner method:\r\n```\r\ndef func(arg=None):\r\n    # type: (Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str,str]\r\n    reveal_type(arg)  # Revealed type is 'Union[builtins.dict[builtins.str, builtins.str], builtins.None]'\r\n    if arg is None:\r\n        arg = {'foo': 'bar'}\r\n    reveal_type(arg)  #  Revealed type is 'builtins.dict[builtins.str, builtins.str]'\r\n\r\n    def inner():\r\n        # type: () -> Dict[str, str]\r\n        reveal_type(arg)  # Revealed type is 'Union[builtins.dict[builtins.str, builtins.str], builtins.None]'\r\n        return arg  # Incompatible return value type (got \"Optional[Dict[str, str]]\", expected Dict[str, str])\r\n\r\n    return inner()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess there are lots of workarounds (assign to temporary variable, pull out the inner method, pass arguments into the inner) but they all require editing existing code which is always scary.  Hmm. I guess the easiest thing is to just add an `assert arg is not None` in the inner.  That's not too intrusive, anyway thought you might want to know.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/2608/reactions","total_count":24,"+1":24,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/2608/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6556700058,"node_id":"LE_lADOAGuhRc5JFvjZzwAAAAGGz02a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6556700058","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-05T13:48:31Z","label":{"name":"topic-runtime-semantics","color":"001D2C"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6556700062,"node_id":"LE_lADOAGuhRc5JFvjZzwAAAAGGz02e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6556700062","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-05T13:48:31Z","label":{"name":"topic-variable-scope","color":"8E45C5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1118742496","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12730#issuecomment-1118742496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12730","id":1118742496,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5Crqfg","user":{"login":"erictraut","id":7040122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDAxMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7040122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut","html_url":"https://github.com/erictraut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-05T16:01:24Z","updated_at":"2022-05-05T16:01:24Z","body":"I'm not able to repro this error with the latest version of mypy.
