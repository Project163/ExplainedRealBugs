Knowing the first element of the matched tuple is of type `MyClass` it should allow for a call to `.say_boo()`.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n`mypy` returns an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexample.py:15: error: \"object\" has no attribute \"say_boo\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\nI made a clean environment with no flags or `ini` files to test the behavior of the example code given.\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: `mypy 0.940`\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: `none`\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): `none`\r\n- Python version used: `Python 3.10.2`\r\n- Operating system and version: `macOS Monterrey 12.2.1`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12364/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12364/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
