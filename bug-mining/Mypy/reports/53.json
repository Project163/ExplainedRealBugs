Then the output is:\r\n```\r\ntest.py:9: note: Revealed type is \"builtins.str\"\r\ntest.py:12: note: Revealed type is \"Union[builtins.list[builtins.str], builtins.list[builtins.int]]\"\r\ntest.py:15: note: Revealed type is \"<nothing>\"\r\n```\r\nwhich is correct.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: mypy 0.910\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: none\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): none\r\n- Python version used: Python 3.9.7\r\n- Operating system and version: MacOS 11.5.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11272/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11272/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
