The failing assertion is:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n    if (type->tp_flags & Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL) {\r\n        _PyObject_ASSERT((PyObject *)type, type->tp_vectorcall_offset > 0);\r\n        _PyObject_ASSERT((PyObject *)type, type->tp_call != NULL);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second of these two assertions fails (the first succeeds). I'm not sure whether the bug is in CPython (perhaps the assertion is wrong, and it's OK to have `tp_call` set to NULL when `Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL` is set if `PyType_Ready` will inherit `tp_call` from the parent class), or whether the bug is in mypyc (perhaps it's not legal to set `Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL` when inheriting `tp_call`).\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: mypy 0.942\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: None\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): None\r\n- Python version used: python3.9-dbg, python3.10-dbg\r\n- Operating system and version: RHEL 7, Debian Bullseye","closed_by":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12605/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
