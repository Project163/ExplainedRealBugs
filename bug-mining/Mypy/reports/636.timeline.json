#16012 \r\n\r\nmypyc ignored custom implementations of `__new__` because, even though a C function representing the method was generated, it was called neither in the type constructor nor in the method assigned to the `tp_new` pointer.\r\n\r\nNow if there's a `__new__` method defined for a type, the corresponding function is called in place of the setup function which is responsible for allocating memory for new objects and initializing their attributes to default values.\r\n\r\nThe setup function is still called when creating instances of the type as calls resolving to `object.__new__()` are transformed to call the setup function. This way, `__new__` can return instances of other types and instances of the type of the class where `__new__` is defined are setup correctly.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of limitations:\r\n- Programs with `super().__new__()` calls in `__new__` methods of non-native classes are rejected because it's more difficult to resolve the setup function for non-native classes but this could probably be supported in the future.\r\n- Similarly, programs are rejected when a class inherits from a non-compiled class. In this case calling the `tp_new` method of the parent type results in an error because cpython expects the sub type to use a wrapper for `tp_new` which compiled classes don't. Allowing this would require compiled types to be initialized more closely to the way cpython does it which might need a lot of work.\r\n- Lastly, when `__new__` is annotated with `@classmethod`, calling it without the type parameter works in compiled code but raises an error in interpreted. I'm not sure of the reason and it's difficult to make it a compiler error because it's outside of what mypyc sees.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19739/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19415283703,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5v70ZwzwAAAASFPbf3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/19415283703","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-29T16:50:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19415283738,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5v70ZwzwAAAASFPbga","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/19415283738","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c32b0a50f2a7329109d049bd439954fdd913e7f2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/c32b0a50f2a7329109d049bd439954fdd913e7f2","created_at":"2025-08-29T16:50:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
