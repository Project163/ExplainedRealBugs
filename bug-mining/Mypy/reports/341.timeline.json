 I've created a project using Django Cookiecutter, following the steps listed here:\r\nhttps://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developing-locally.html\r\n\r\n(from a project generation perspective, I'm using about as vanilla setup as possible -- \"no\" to pretty well all questions except \"y\" for Windows and \"y\" for Whitenoise; no cloud provider, using GitHub as CI tool).\r\n\r\nWhen I open the project up in VSCode and setup a path to dmypy.exe correctly (as found in my virtual environment folder) I get the following error raised by VSCode in the output panel:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMypy extension activated, version 0.2.1\r\nRegistering listener for interpreter changed event\r\nListener registered\r\n...\r\nMypy settings changed: c:\\Users\\MYUSERNAME\\Development\\Navigator\\nav\r\n[3] Check workspace: c:\\Users\\MYUSERNAME\\Development\\Navigator\\nav\r\n[3] Received python path from Python extension: c:\\Users\\MYUSERNAME\\Development\\Navigator\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe\r\n[3] Running dmypy in folder c:\\Users\\MYUSERNAME\\Development\\Navigator\\nav\r\n'c:\\Users\\MYUSERNAME\\Development\\Navigator\\nav\\..\\.venv\\scripts\\dmypy.exe' --status-file 'c:\\Users\\MYUSERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Code\\User\\workspaceStorage\\0e535676e284b08a0f096efc595261d2\\matangover.mypy\\dmypy-25dcc9f6aa1070ea6d08209fdd5961c72b27b416.json' run --log-file 'c:\\Users\\MYUSERNAME\\AppData\\Roaming\\Code\\User\\workspaceStorage\\0e535676e284b08a0f096efc595261d2\\matangover.mypy\\dmypy-25dcc9f6aa1070ea6d08209fdd5961c72b27b416.log' -- . --show-column-numbers --no-error-summary --no-pretty --no-color-output --python-executable 'c:\\Users\\MYUSERNAME\\Development\\Navigator\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe'\r\n[3] stdout:\r\nDaemon started\r\nRestarting: configuration changed\r\nDaemon stopped\r\nDaemon started\r\n\r\n[3] stderr:\r\nResponse: {'restart': 'configuration changed', 'platform': 'win32', 'python_version': '3_9', 'roundtrip_time': 0.5840277671813965}\r\n\r\n[3] Error running mypy in c:\\Users\\MYUSERNAME\\Development\\Navigator\\nav: mypy failed with error: \"Response: {'restart': 'configuration changed', 'platform': 'win32', 'python_version': '3_9', 'roundtrip_time': 0.5840277671813965}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is my .vscode/settings.json file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"python.linting.mypyEnabled\": true,\r\n  \"python.linting.enabled\": true,\r\n  \"mypy.dmypyExecutable\": \"${workspaceFolder}\\\\..\\\\.venv\\\\scripts\\\\dmypy.exe\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not quite sure how to further debug this issue (\"configuration changed\" isn't turning up relevant google results).  What I know is that this extension works for other projects that I've manually added mypy to.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure who exactly I should be raising my issue to -- this VSCode extension, mypy, or the Django Cookiecutter folks, but thought I'd start here.  Any advice or direction would be appreciated! Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n**Update**: Still getting the error, but can confirm that mypy works fine when called via command line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(.venv) PS

Especially if you have more than one commit, it is helpful to \r\ngive a summary of what your contribution as a whole is trying to solve.\r\nAlso, please describe shortly how you tested that your fix actually works.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR intends to either switch this plugin over to use dmypy completely, or at least provide an option to do so. Using dmypy is much faster and efficient than using mypy, it will allow sub-second scans compared to the 5-15 seconds it could take for mypy to do the same task.\r\n\r\nThere is still some work left to do. E.g. deciding whether we should just always use dmypy or whether it should be configurable (and how that should work). A fix/solution is also needed to compensate for the fact that dmypy does not support `--follow-imports silent`. I'm proposing that the function that parses the mypy output can filter out any errors produced by `--follow-imports error` and that we default to that option instead.\r\n\r\nLastly, it probably just needs a tad more testing (e.g. in PyCharm, and perhaps some other projects).\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the code in this PR serves as a proof-of-concept for now, and I intend to follow through with getting it into a merge-able state as long as some decisions on the above are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Type of Changes\r\n<!-- Leave the corresponding lines for the applicable type of change: -->\r\n|   | Type
