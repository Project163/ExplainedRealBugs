#531.\r\nPartially fixes #507.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n- This PR introduces the function `get_arxiv_id()` to infer the `arXiv ID` from the file path.\r\n- This function gets called when calling `bbs_database parse` with `--input-type=tei-xml-arxiv`, which is basically the good old `TEIXMLParser` with a tiny change when `is_arxiv` is set to `True`.\r\n- This `arXiv ID` is now also used when we compute and assign the article `uid`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to test?\r\n\r\nSee the unit tests that were modified or added.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR refers to an issue from the [issue tracker](https://github.com/BlueBrain/Search/issues).\r\n  (if it is not the case, please create an issue first).\r\n- [x] Unit tests added.\r\n  (if needed)\r\n- [x] Documentation and `whatsnew.rst` updated.\r\n  (if needed)\r\n- [x] Type annotations added.\r\n  (if a function is added or modified)\r\n- [x] All CI tests pass.

Report**\r\n\r\nVariables whose type is a union that includes types.EllipsisType can't be narrowed using `if foo is Ellipsis`. That's unexpected to me, because Ellipsis is documented as the only instance of EllipsisType.\r\n\r\nSimilar but slightly different issues occur with NoneType and NotImplementedType.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nMinimal reproducing case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom types import EllipsisType\r\n\r\n\r\ndef working(foo: EllipsisType | int) -> int:\r\n    if isinstance(foo, EllipsisType):\r\n        # Revealed type is \"builtins.ellipsis\"  (seems to understand the singleton relationship here)\r\n        foo = 1\r\n    reveal_type(foo)  # Revealed type is \"builtins.int\"\r\n    return foo  # no error\r\n\r\ndef not_working(foo: EllipsisType | int) -> int:\r\n    if foo is Ellipsis:\r\n        reveal_type(foo)  # Revealed type is \"Union[builtins.ellipsis, builtins.int]\" (why is int still here?)\r\n        foo = 1\r\n    reveal_type(foo)  # Revealed type is \"Union[builtins.ellipsis, builtins.int]\"\r\n    return foo  # error: Incompatible return value type (got \"Union[ellipsis, int]\", expected \"int\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nMypy appears to believe that there might be values whose type is EllipsisType but which don't have the same identity as Ellipsis. I don't think that's possible.\r\n\r\nSimilar things happen with None and NoneType:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom types import NoneType\r\n\r\n\r\ndef working(foo: NoneType | int) -> int:\r\n    if isinstance(foo, NoneType):\r\n        reveal_type(foo)  # Revealed type is \"types.NoneType\"  (interesting difference from Ellipsis)\r\n        foo = 1\r\n    reveal_type(foo)  # Revealed type is \"builtins.int\"\r\n    return foo  # no error\r\n\r\n\r\ndef not_working(foo: NoneType | int) -> int:\r\n    if foo is None:\r\n        reveal_type(foo)  # Doesn't show any output (?)\r\n        foo = 1\r\n    reveal_type(foo)  # Revealed type is \"Union[types.NoneType, builtins.int]\"\r\n    return foo  # Incompatible return value type (got \"Union[NoneType, int]\", expected \"int\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotImplemented and NotImplementedType pass without error, but appear to do so for the wrong reasons:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom types import NotImplementedType\r\n\r\n\r\ndef working(foo: NotImplementedType | int) -> int:\r\n    if isinstance(foo, NotImplementedType):\r\n        reveal_type(foo)  # Revealed type is \"builtins._NotImplementedType\"\r\n        foo = 1\r\n    reveal_type(foo)  # Revealed type is \"Union[builtins._NotImplementedType, builtins.int]\"\r\n    return foo  # no error ??\r\n\r\n\r\ndef also_working(foo: NotImplementedType | int) -> int:\r\n    if foo is NotImplemented:\r\n        reveal_type(foo)  # Revealed type is \"Union[builtins._NotImplementedType, builtins.int]\"\r\n        foo = 1\r\n    reveal_type(foo)  # Revealed type is \"Union[builtins._NotImplementedType, builtins.int]\"\r\n    return foo  # no error ??\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: mypy 0.961 (compiled: yes)\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: none\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): none\r\n- Python version used: python Python 3.10.4\r\n- Operating system and version: macOS 10.15.7\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13117/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13117/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1186148814","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11288#issuecomment-1186148814","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11288","id":1186148814,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5GszHO","user":{"login":"KotlinIsland","id":65446343,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDQ2MzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65446343?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland","html_url":"https://github.com/KotlinIsland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-16T10:40:59Z","updated_at":"2022-07-16T10:40:59Z","body":"@JukkaL I have partially improved this case in basedmypy.\r\n\r\nbasedmypy:\r\n```py\r\nfrom types import NoneType\r\n\r\ndef foo(n: NoneType):  # error: Variable \"types.NoneType\" is not valid as a type\r\n    print(\"hi\")\r\n\r\nnt: type[None] = NoneType  # no error\r\n```\r\n\r\njust by simply making `NoneType` an alias instead of a class def.

So, I think it's a fairly good name for the type, given that we already have None, that wacky absence-indicator value that Python programmers love using. (Not to be confused with `None` by itself in a type annotation, which means NoneType.) While it is *a* unit type (it has only one value), it's not the only possible unit type, so I think Unit would be a worse name for it. That also wouldn't suggest anything about how it's used to indicate absence.
