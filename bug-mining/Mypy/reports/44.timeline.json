Can I take this on? It's my very first issue! From what @domdfcoding has investigated, it seems that for py3.9, we can remove the constraint that the slice which is an `ast.Tuple` node not contain `ast.Slice` nodes. Looking at https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#subscripting, I was wondering why that check was there in the first place since it says \"It can be a Tuple and contain a Slice\". For py3.8 and lower, the API documentation is not as clear as to what the slice can be but https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/ast.html indicates that slice is probably `ast.Slice` or `ast.ExtSlice` or `ast.Index`. So, for that I'm not sure, perhaps we can include that the slice can be `ast.ExtSlice` as well?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/825713480/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"amrit110","id":8986523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5ODY1MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8986523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrit110","html_url":"https://github.com/amrit110","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrit110/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrit110/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrit110/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrit110/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrit110/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrit110/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrit110/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrit110/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amrit110/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4637368407,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDYzNzM2ODQwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/4637368407","actor":{"login":"domdfcoding","id":8050853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTA4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8050853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding","html_url":"https://github.com/domdfcoding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-23T14:52:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4637368416,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2MzczNjg0MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/4637368416","actor":{"login":"domdfcoding","id":8050853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTA4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8050853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding","html_url":"https://github.com/domdfcoding","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domdfcoding/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-04-23T14:52:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"teichert","id":2686038,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODYwMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2686038?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teichert","html_url":"https://github.com/teichert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teichert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teichert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teichert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teichert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teichert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teichert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teichert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teichert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teichert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-04T19:32:39Z","updated_at":"2021-06-04T19:32:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/patrick-kidger/torchtyping/issues/15","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/patrick-kidger/torchtyping","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/patrick-kidger/torchtyping/issues/15/labels{/name}"

It is useful to be able to separately document that those sizes must be the same while acknowledging the differing purposes of these dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe following example demonstrates the idea---showing three related features that already work in torchtyping as well as a proposed feature:\r\n```python\r\ndef func(feats: TensorType[\"b\": ..., \"annotator\": 3, \"word\": \"words\", \"feature\"],\r\n         predicates: TensorType[\"b\": ..., \"annotator\": 3, \"predicate\": \"words\", \"feature\"],\r\n         pred_arg_pairs: TensorType[\"b\": ..., \"annotator\": 3, \"predicate\": \"words\", \"argument\": \"words\"]):\r\n    # feats has shape (..., 3, words, features)\r\n    # predicates has shape (..., 3, words, features)\r\n    # pred_arg_pairs has shape (..., 3, words, words)\r\n    # the ... b dimensions are checked to be of the same size.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThings that already work:\r\n- dimensions that share names (like \"feature\") are enforced to share the same dimension size\r\n- named dimensions (like \"annotator\") can specify a specific dimension size which is enforced\r\n- named ellipses (like \"batch\") can be used to represent a fixed (but only known at runtime) set of dimensions and corresponding sizes [this is very close to what I want, but (1) I would prefer to not have the extra power of matching an unspecified number of dimensions and (2) as I understand it, ellipses only represent a single variable set of dimensions, but I want to be able to separately constrain multiple sets of dimensions to share respective sizes]\r\n\r\nProposed:\r\n- named dimensions (like \"token\", \"predicate\", and \"argument\") should be able to declare a shared-but-unspecified dimension size given by name (\"words\" in this example)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you would probably want to enforce that, if the specified \"size name\" matches the name of another dimension (like \"word\" in the following example), then the sizes of those dimensions should be the same:\r\n```python\r\ndef func(feats: TensorType[\"b\": ..., \"annotator\": 3, \"word\", \"feature\"],\r\n         predicates: TensorType[\"b\": ..., \"annotator\": 3, \"predicate\": \"word\", \"feature\"],\r\n         pred_arg_pairs: TensorType[\"b\": ..., \"annotator\": 3, \"predicate\": \"word\", \"argument\": \"word\"]):\r\n    # feats has shape (..., 3, words, features)\r\n    # predicates has shape (..., 3, words, features)\r\n    # pred_arg_pairs has shape (..., 3, words, words)\r\n    # the ... b dimensions are checked to be of the same size.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/patrick-kidger/torchtyping/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/patrick-kidger/torchtyping/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/855388193","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10266#issuecomment-855388193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10266","id":855388193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NTM4ODE5Mw==","user":{"login":"PrasanthChettri","id":35295049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Mjk1MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35295049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrasanthChettri","html_url":"https://github.com/PrasanthChettri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrasanthChettri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrasanthChettri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrasanthChettri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrasanthChettri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrasanthChettri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrasanthChettri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrasanthChettri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrasanthChettri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PrasanthChettri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-06T12:04:15Z","updated_at":"2021-06-06T12:04:15Z","body":"@JelleZijlstra I am trying to fix the bug, for the example given above it's an instance of ast.Tuple(ast.Name, ast.Slice) and the problem is that of stated by @domdfcoding, and we will need to modify the conditions , it is probably not a good idea to just remove the constraint,  I will need a little bit of help with the new condition to replace it with.
