It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\nWrite down what you thought would happen. If you expected no errors, delete this section.\n-->\nI would expect mypy to complain about 3rd argument (`c - c_func`).\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\n<!-- What went wrong? Paste mypy's output. -->\n\nMypy complains about 1st argument, which is 100% correct (`a: int`)\n```\na.py:24: error: Cannot infer type argument 1 of \"bigfunc\"  [misc]\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n```\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\n\n- Mypy version used: 1.16.0\n- Mypy command-line flags: None\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): None\n- Python version used: 3.11.2\n\n<!-- You can freely edit this text, please remove all the lines you believe are unnecessary. -->\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19289/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
