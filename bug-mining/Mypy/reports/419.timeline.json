#16367\r\n\r\nDuring semantic analysis, we try to parse all strings as types, including those inside Literal[]. Previously, we preserved the original string in the `UnboundType.original_str_expr` attribute, but if a type is parsed as a Union, we didn't have a place to put the value.\r\n\r\nThis PR instead always wraps string types in a RawExpressionType node, which now optionally includes a `.node` attribute containing the parsed type. This way, we don't need to worry about preserving the original string as a custom attribute on different kinds of types that can appear in this context.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that more code needs to
