the following minimal example\r\n\r\n```python\r\nassert type(tuple) is type\r\n\r\nclass MyMeta(type): pass\r\n\r\nclass MyTuple(tuple, metaclass=MyMeta): pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs of `0.990`, mypy complains about this\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: Metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases  [misc]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame if I use\r\n```python\r\nclass MyMeta(tuple.__class__): pass\r\n```\r\nor \r\n```python\r\nclass MyMeta(type(tuple)): pass\r\n```\r\ninstead\r\n\r\n**Pitch**\r\n\r\nI propose 2 alternatives to help users deal with this\r\n * Teach mypy that `tuple.__class__ is type` and that this is fine (preferred)\r\n * Tell users to use `# typing: ignore` to resolve such cases.\r\n   Technically, this is already possible today, but I suggest 2 improvements:\r\n   * https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/metaclasses.html#gotchas-and-limitations-of-metaclass-support only lists what mypy can't handle. It does not talk about how to work around it => add a note telling users to `# typing: ignore[misc]` it. I'd like to mention that this feels pretty broad of an exception and might hide other real problems. Since this is an area where mypy might be overly restrictive and a workaround might be necessary, it should maybe be in a less broad category.\r\n   * This is the more important point to me: this comment needs to be added to every subclass of `MyTuple` which can be frustratingly tedious. Maybe there should be away to tell mypy \"ok, you might not understand this, but trust me that this class `MyTuple` has a valid metaclass, assume so for all child classes\".","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14033/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
