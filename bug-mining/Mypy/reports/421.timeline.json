`--show-error-code` flag to `mypy`. For eg:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cat sample.py\r\ndef foo(a: str) -> str:\r\n    return '(' + a.split() + ')'\r\n\r\n$ mypy sample.py --show-error-codes\r\nsample.py:2: error: Unsupported operand types for + (\"str\" and \"List[str]\")  [operator]\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in total there's ~at least 80~ probably around 400 unique error messages, each for a different kind of error.\r\n\r\n#### The idea\r\n- Create a proper list of numeric error codes, say `001` though `080` for eg., identifying each error uniquely.\r\n- Have the error code shown directly before the error message in mypy output, just like `pylint`, `flake8`, and others.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cat mytest.py      \r\ndef a():\r\n    print(foo)\r\n\r\n$ pylint mytest.py\r\n************* Module mytest\r\nmytest.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)\r\nmytest.py:1:0: C0103: Function name \"a\" doesn't conform to snake_case naming style (invalid-name)\r\nmytest.py:2:10: E0602: Undefined variable 'foo' (undefined-variable)\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n$ flake8 mytest.py\r\nmytest.py:1:1: D100 Missing docstring in public module\r\nmytest.py:1:1: D103 Missing docstring in public function\r\nmytest.py:2:11: F821 undefined name 'foo'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've run the idea past @ethanhs and I'm told that this would be a great-to-have in mypy.

Issues\n\n- [X] I have checked [existing issues](https://github.com/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim/issues) and there are no existing ones with the same request.\n\n### Feature description\n\nMypy is conspicuously absent from the list of supported diagnostic tools. I was wondering whether there is a reason for that. It is supported by [nvim-lint](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint/blob/c086009aaa6e73c0cf39432997790b317a875fca/lua/lint/linters/mypy.lua) and its implementation doesn't seem to be particularly troublesome.\r\nMypy has open issues to add support for [json formatting](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10816) and a full-fledged [language server](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10463), although I doubt that these are going to be implemented anytime soon.\n\n### Help\n\nYes\n\n### Implementation help\n\nI can try to implement it myself, but I may need some help to make it work properly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim/issues/139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jose-elias-alvarez/null-ls.nvim/issues/139/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/944251284","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10816#issuecomment-944251284","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10816","id":944251284,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc44SCGU","user":{"login":"intgr","id":137616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzYxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/intgr","html_url":"https://github.com/intgr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intgr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intgr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intgr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intgr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intgr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intgr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intgr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intgr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intgr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-15T12:18:27Z","updated_at":"2021-10-15T12:18:27Z","body":"Turns

Description\r\n\r\nResolves #10816 \r\n\r\nThe changes this PR makes are relatively small.\r\nIt currently:\r\n- Adds an `--output` option to mypy CLI\r\n- Adds a `ErrorFormatter` abstract base class, which can be subclassed to create new output formats\r\n- Adds a `MypyError` class that represents the external format of a mypy error.\r\n- Adds a check for `--output` being `'json'`, in which case the `JSONFormatter` is used to produce the reported output.\r\n\r\n#### Demo:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ mypy mytest.py              \r\nmytest.py:2: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"str\", variable has type \"int\")\r\nmytest.py:3: error: Name \"z\" is not defined\r\nFound 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n\r\n$ mypy mytest.py --output=json\r\n{\"file\": \"mytest.py\", \"line\": 2, \"column\": 4, \"severity\": \"error\", \"message\": \"Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \\\"str\\\", variable has type \\\"int\\\")\", \"code\": \"assignment\"}\r\n{\"file\": \"mytest.py\", \"line\": 3, \"column\": 4, \"severity\": \"error\", \"message\": \"Name \\\"z\\\" is not defined\", \"code\": \"name-defined\"}\r\n```\r\n---\r\nA few notes regarding the changes:\r\n- I chose to re-use the intermediate `ErrorTuple`s created during error reporting, instead of using the more general `ErrorInfo` class, because a lot of machinery already exists in mypy for sorting and removing duplicate error reports, which produces `ErrorTuple`s at the end. The error sorting and duplicate removal logic could perhaps be separated out from the rest of the code, to be able to use `ErrorInfo` objects more freely.\r\n- `ErrorFormatter` doesn't really need to be an abstract class, but I think it would be better this way. If there's a different method that would be preferred, I'd be happy to know.\r\n- The `--output` CLI option is, most probably, not added in the correct place. Any help in how to do it properly would be appreciated, the mypy option parsing code seems very complex.\r\n- The ability to add custom output formats can be simply added by subclassing the `ErrorFormatter` class inside a mypy plugin, and adding a `name` field to the formatters. The mypy runtime can then check through the `__subclasses__` of the formatter and determine if such a formatter is present.\r\n  The \"checking for the `name` field\" part of this code might be appropriate to add within this PR itself, instead of hard-coding `JSONFormatter`. Does that sound like a good idea?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11396/reactions","total_count":17,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":7,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11396/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/989030733","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10816#issuecomment-989030733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10816","id":989030733,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc4682lN","user":{"login":"nvuillam","id":17500430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTAwNDMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17500430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvuillam","html_url":"https://github.com/nvuillam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvuillam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvuillam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvuillam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvuillam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvuillam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvuillam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvuillam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvuillam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvuillam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-08T17:41:41Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T17:41:41Z","body":"SARIF
