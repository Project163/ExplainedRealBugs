Report**\r\n\r\nI was recommended to post a new issue that is very close to [this one](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10601). I am specifically getting this error concerning the [`pyyaml`](https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/) package.\r\n\r\nWhen running \r\n\r\n```python\r\nmypy . --ignore-imports\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am getting an error saying\r\n```\r\nmain.py:1: error: Library stubs not installed for \"yaml\" (or incompatible with Python 3.9)\r\nmain.py:1: note: Hint: \"python3 -m pip install types-PyYAML\"\r\nmain.py:1: note: (or run \"mypy --install-types\" to install all missing stub packages)\r\nmain.py:1: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#missing-imports\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nI've created a [repo demonstrating the issue](https://github.com/alexanderdamiani/mypy_error_example). To reproduce the error:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the `Actions` tab\r\n2. Select the `Python Windows mypy` workflow\r\n3. Click `Run Workflow` and run it on the `main` branch\r\n\r\nThere are only three files:\r\n1. `requirements.txt`\r\n```\r\npyyaml\r\n```\r\n2. `main.py`\r\n```python\r\nimport yaml\r\n```\r\n3. `action.yml` (GitHub Action workflow file)\r\n    * builds a Docker container with `windows-latest` as the base image and runs `mypy . --ignore-missing-imports` on the top-level directory\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\n* `--ignore-missing-imports` should ignore the error\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n* error is shown and there is no alternative flag to use to ignore it\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 0.902\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: `--ignore-missing-imports`\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): n/a\r\n- Python version used: 3.9.5\r\n- Operating system and version: Docker base image `windows-latest`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10632/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10632/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"jameslamb","id":7608904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MDg5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7608904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb","html_url":"https://github.com/jameslamb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jameslamb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-14T13:55:59Z","updated_at":"2021-06-14T13:55:59Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saturncloud/prefect-saturn/issues/46","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saturncloud/prefect-saturn","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saturncloud/prefect-saturn/issues/46/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saturncloud/prefect-saturn/issues/46/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saturncloud/prefect-saturn/issues/46/events","html_url":"https://github.com/saturncloud/prefect-saturn/pull/46","id":920438292,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjY5NTg3NzY5","number":46,"title":"install

That will get us slightly richer coverage from `mypy`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saturncloud/prefect-saturn/issues/46/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saturncloud/prefect-saturn/issues/46/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1102978164","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10601#issuecomment-1102978164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10601","id":1102978164,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5Bvhx0","user":{"login":"abhinavcoder","id":8461802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0NjE4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8461802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavcoder","html_url":"https://github.com/abhinavcoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavcoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavcoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavcoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavcoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavcoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavcoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavcoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavcoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavcoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-19T18:52:40Z","updated_at":"2022-04-19T18:52:40Z","body":"@JukkaL \r\nI am facing a similar issue when using the following code:\r\n```\r\nfrom google.cloud import storage\r\n```\r\nError:\r\n```\r\nerror: Module \"google.cloud\" has no attribute \"storage\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Settings:\r\n  -
