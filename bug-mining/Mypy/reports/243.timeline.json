Report**\r\n\r\nThe following snippet works fine at runtime on 3.10+. It should be accepted as a valid type alias definition on Python 3.10+ (and should be accepted in stub files regardless of Python version). However, mypy raises a false-positive error. The error does not go away if you use `typing.TypeAlias`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Callable, TypeAlias\r\n\r\nA = Callable[[], str] | int  # error: Unsupported left operand type for | (\"object\")\r\nB: TypeAlias = Callable[[], str] | int  # error: Unsupported left operand type for | (\"object\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nMypy _does_ accept the following (with the order of types reversed) as a valid type alias on Python 3.10+ and in stub files:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nC = int | Callable[[], str]  # No error using Python 3.10 (in a `.py file), or in a stub file on any Python version.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMuch like with #12392, this error is only reproduceable if `Callable` is the outermost type. The following produces no errors:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nD = list[Callable[[], str] | int]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is also an additional bug that only exists for stub files running with `--python-version` set to 3.9 or lower, when using a `Callable` that has a PEP 604 union as its return type or a PEP 604 union in its parameter specification, and when the `Callable` is itself in a PEP 604 union:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nX = int | Callable[[], str | bool]  # error: Unsupported left operand type for | (\"Type[str]\")\r\nY = int | Callable[[str | bool], str]  # error: Unsupported left operand type for | (\"Type[str]\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n- Mypy playground link [here](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.10&gist=18c29b7bef9d61e8a29af292863d1072) for the errors which affect stubs and `.py` files.\r\n- For the stub-specific errors, paste the code samples into a `.pyi` file, then run mypy on the file with `--python-version=3.9`.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nNo errors should be reported.\r\n\r\nCc.
