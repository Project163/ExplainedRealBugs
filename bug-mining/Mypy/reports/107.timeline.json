is a working exhaustiveness checking implementation in https://github.com/freundTech/mypy (feature-match-stmt-exhaustiveness branch. I made it the default branch)\r\n\r\nI could make a PR from that branch, but it would need major rebasing. It's probably better to cherry-pick the relevant commits to a new branch instead of rebasing all of it.\r\n\r\nThe implementation works, but I'm not really happy with it's design. It checks all patterns twice. First ignoring guard statements in order to infer rough types for capture patterns (capture patterns need to be inferred before a guard statement can use them) and then a second time with guard patterns to infer more accurate types and narrow the capture patterns.\r\n\r\nI did this because I thought that mypy couldn't broaden a variable's type after it was inferred. Later I found out that it can do that, but didn't have enough time to redo my implementation.\r\n\r\nAn example to illustrate the problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\nx: object\r\n\r\nmatch x:\r\n    case int(c) if c < 5:\r\n        pass\r\n    case str(c):\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n`c` should be inferred as `int | str`. To know this we need to look at both cases. Before checking the second case we need to check the first case. Checking the first case includes checking the guard. Checking the guard required c to be inferred first.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1015585038/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"freundTech","id":9515067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MTUwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9515067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/freundTech","html_url":"https://github.com/freundTech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freundTech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freundTech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freundTech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freundTech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freundTech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freundTech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freundTech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freundTech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/freundTech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1015613170","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12010#issuecomment-1015613170","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12010","id":1015613170,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc48iQby","user":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-18T16:52:30Z","updated_at":"2022-01-18T16:52:30Z","body":"Thanks!

an issue for tracking the current state of mypy on CPython 3.10\r\n\r\nCPython version: 3.10.0\r\nmypy version: latest master (https://github.com/python/mypy/commit/e6b91bdc5c253cefba940b0864a8257d833f0d8b)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies:\r\n- [x] typed_ast is currently broken. Fixed on master, but no release to pypi yet (https://github.com/python/typed_ast/pull/155)\r\n- [x] typed_ast again broken in 3.10.0a7. PR https://github.com/python/typed_ast/pull/158\r\n- [x] lxml is currently broken due to a cython bug. The bug has been fixed in cython 0.29.22, but lxml hasn't been built with the new version yet (https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/1904900)\r\n- [x] virtualenv  uses distutils, which is deprecated and will be removed in python 3.12. Mypy test-depends on `virtualenv<20`, and it looks like only virtualenv >=20 is still in active development. (https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10407)\r\n- [x] pytest breaks on python 3.10. This is already fixed upstream, but mypy pins pytest to <6.2, because of python 3.5 support\r\n\r\n### Tests:\r\n- [x] Some tests from FineGrainedSuite, FineGrainedCacheSuite and PythonCmdlineSuite` are broken, because cpython parser error messages changed. (https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/10404)\r\n    * Some occurrences of `error: invalid syntax` are now `error: expected ':'`\r\n    * Some occurrences of `error: unexpected EOF while parsing` are now `error: '(' was never closed`\r\n- [x] Tests from SamplesSuite break with `mypy/typeshed/stdlib/types.pyi:334: error: Name '_NotImplementedType' is not defined` (https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/5044)\r\n- [x] Enable CI for python 3.10  (#11294)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- [x] Pattern matching\r\n  - [x] Pattern matching is not yet supported (#10191)\r\n  - [x] Exhaustiveness checking for pattern matching (#12010)\r\n  - [ ] Pattern matching in mypyc (https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc/issues/911)\r\n- [x] Support explicit TypeAlias (#9404)\r\n- [x] Support PEP 604 syntax for runtime use cases (#9880)\r\n    - [x]  PEP 604 for TypeVar bounds #10949\r\n- [x] Support for dataclasses' kw_only (#10867)\r\n- [ ] Support PEP 612 Parameter Specification Variables (#8645)\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n- [x] mypyc is broken, because `_PyObject_HasAttrId` has been removed from CPython (https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/22629). PR #10202.\r\n- [x] mypy/sitepkgs.py imports `distutils`, which is deprecated and will be removed in python 3.12 (#10203).\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- [x] Build Python 3.10 wheels\r\n- [x] Add Python 3.10 classifier","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10201/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":13,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10201/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1019412831","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12010#issuecomment-1019412831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12010","id":1019412831,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc48wwFf","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-23T04:41:10Z","updated_at":"2022-01-23T04:41:10Z","body":"I'm wondering if this is the same issue as what I am experiencing?\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef testing_return(test: str) -> str:\r\n    match test:\r\n        case \"test\":\r\n            return test\r\n        case \"testing\":\r\n            return test\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    print(testing_return(\"test\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in:\r\n`test.py:1: error: Missing return statement`\r\n\r\nit seems even valid match case blocks in python 3.10 results in mypy giving the missing return statement error.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1019412831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1019413438","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12010#issuecomment-1019413438","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12010","id":1019413438,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc48wwO-","user":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-23T04:48:18Z","updated_at":"2022-01-23T04:48:31Z","body":"@Pavocracy that error is correct.

It also seems to jive better with PEP 20's \"Zen of Python\": Explicit is better than implicit, Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules and, most importantly, **Errors should never pass silently**.\r\n\r\nIMO, not handling exhaustiveness is equivalent to the required `break` inside of a C/C++ style `switch` statement - generally considered to be bug-prone and a language design mistake.  \r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority of languages (all?) I am familiar with that support structural pattern matching have exhaustiveness checking - with good reasons.  Unless there are strong technical issues, it may be reasonable to go with what's familiar/established.  It will also make Python more attractive to domains for which other languages have typically \"dominated\", such as compilers.\r\n \r\n`case _: assert False` or similar will lead to the same problems as missed `break`s.  Even if a pattern is exhaustive today, it may not be tomorrow and requiring discipline from programmers is likely not to work \"when programming in the large\".\r\n\r\nFinally, `case _: pass` will be clearer *and* shorter to write.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1019552452/reactions","total_count":15,"+1":15,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TomasPuverle","id":8096452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTY0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8096452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle","html_url":"https://github.com/TomasPuverle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"TomasPuverle","id":8096452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTY0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8096452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle","html_url":"https://github.com/TomasPuverle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomasPuverle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-23T19:37:55Z","updated_at":"2022-01-23T19:37:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/pyright/issues/2569","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/pyright","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/pyright/issues/2569/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/pyright/issues/2569/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/pyright/issues/2569/events","html_url":"https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/issues/2569","id":1054254488,"node_id":"I_kwDOCnBEvM4-1qWY","number":2569,"title":"Exhaustiveness
