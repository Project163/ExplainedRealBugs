you're not sure whether what you're experiencing is a mypy bug, please see the \"Question and Help\" form instead.\r\nPlease consider:\r\n\r\n- checking our common issues page: https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html\r\n- searching our issue tracker: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues to see if it's already been reported\r\n- asking on gitter chat: https://gitter.im/python/typing\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Bug Report**\r\n\r\nThere are two overloaded versions of function: the first version for `AsyncContextManager` parameter, the second version for `Callable` with ParamSpec. \r\nStatic type checker must choose the first version, but it chooses the second one.    \r\n\r\nBUT: after removing `ParamSpec` from function signature, mypy ends up working well (see the comment in example).\r\n\r\nNote: pyright (v. 1.1.386) works just fine on it.\r\nPossibly related to #17960 \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nfrom types import TracebackType\r\nfrom typing import Any, AsyncContextManager, Callable, TypeVar, overload\r\n\r\nfrom typing_extensions import ParamSpec, Self\r\n\r\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\r\nP = ParamSpec(\"P\")\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Animal:\r\n    async def __aenter__(self) -> Self:\r\n        return self\r\n\r\n    async def __aexit__(\r\n        self,\r\n        typ: type[BaseException] | None,\r\n        exc: BaseException | None,\r\n        tb: TracebackType | None,\r\n    ) -> None:\r\n        return None\r\n\r\n    def __call__(self) -> str:\r\n        return \"name\"\r\n\r\n\r\n@overload\r\ndef name(animal: AsyncContextManager[T]) -> T: ...\r\n\r\n\r\n@overload\r\ndef name(\r\n    animal: Callable[P, T],\r\n    *_args: P.args,\r\n    **_kwargs: P.kwargs,\r\n) -> T: ...\r\n\r\n\r\n# BUT!\r\n# if replace the second overload with\r\n# @overload\r\n# def name(animal: Callable[[], T]) -> T: ...\r\n# or even\r\n# def name(animal: Callable[[int], T]) -> T: ...\r\n# everything works fine\r\n\r\n\r\ndef name(\r\n    animal: Any,\r\n    *_args: Any,\r\n    **_kwargs: Any,\r\n) -> Any:\r\n    return animal\r\n\r\n\r\ndog = Animal()\r\ndog2: Animal = name(dog)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Live playground link](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.12&gist=e7cd0c36dbb62796cad89e12da0d540f)\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\nmypy has not reported any issue with such overloaded functions, and should still not report as it was for mypy prior to 1.12.0.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n```bash\r\nmain.py:58: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"str\", variable has type \"Animal\")  [assignment]\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 1.12.0, 1.12.1, 1.13.0\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: N/A\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): N/A\r\n- Python version used: 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18027/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
