Create a fresh virtual environment with Python `>=3.7` and install `mypy==0.941`:\r\n```bash\r\npython3.9 -m venv venv\r\nsource venv/bin/activate\r\npip install -U pip\r\npip install mypy==0.941\r\n```\r\n2. Create a file named `a.py` with the following content:\r\n```python\r\nclass A:\r\n    pass\r\n\r\n```\r\n3. Create a file named `b.py` in the same directory with the following content:\r\n```python\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\r\nfrom a import A\r\n\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass B(A):\r\n    c: str\r\n\r\n```\r\n4. Run `stubgen b.py -o .`\r\n5. Run `python b.pyi`\r\n\r\nThe generated `b.pyi` file has the following content:\r\n```python\r\nfrom a import A\r\n\r\nclass B(A):\r\n    c: str\r\n    def __init__(self, *, c, **) -> None: ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- The stub generation works correctly if we don't annotate the class with `@dataclass`.\r\n- The stub generation works correctly if the superclass `A` is in the same file.\r\n- The stub generation works correctly if `B` doesn't inherit from `A`.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nThe generated `b.pyi` file has valid Python syntax and the `python` command executes without errors.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nThe generated `b.pyi` file doesn't have valid Python syntax and the command `python b.pyi` produces the following error:\r\n```python\r\n  File \"/path/to/sandbox/b.pyi\", line 5\r\n    def __init__(self, *, c, **) -> None: ...\r\n                               ^\r\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: `0.941`. Reproducible with `0.940` as well. Cannot reproduce with `0.931`.\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: `-o`\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): None\r\n- Python version used: `3.9.0`. Also reproduced with `3.7.12`, `3.8.5` and `3.10.0`. Cannot reproduce with `3.6.9`.\r\n- Operating system and version: `Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS`. Also reproduced with `macOS Big Sur 11.5.2`\r\n- `pip list` output for Python 3.9.0:\r\n```bash\r\n$ pip list\r\nPackage           Version\r\n----------------- -------\r\nmypy              0.941\r\nmypy-extensions   0.4.3\r\npip               22.0.4\r\nsetuptools        49.2.1\r\ntomli             2.0.1\r\ntyping_extensions 4.1.1\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12441/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
