For callable types, there's a much higher degree of confidence that evaluating a callable as a boolean is unintentional.\r\n\r\n- The error message should be specific, e.g.\r\n   ```patch\r\n   - error: Member \"my_method\" has type \"function\" which does not implement __bool__ or __len__ so it could always be true in boolean context \r\n   + error: Member \"my_method\" is a method (are you trying to use it as a property?)\r\n   ```\r\n   (happy to wordsmith this more, only trying to illustrate that I want it to be friendlier and more actionable)\r\n- The feature could be a separate error-code (thus splitting \"callable evaluated in boolean context\" from `truthy-bool`), or perhaps a way to configure `truthy-bool` to have a reduced scope? (Is there a common idiom for that?)","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12621/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
