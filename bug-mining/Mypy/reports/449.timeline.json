If this pull request fixes an issue, add \"Fixes #NNN\" with the issue number. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #17765\r\n\r\nThe offender for this crash appears to be this snippet:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/python/mypy/blob/72c413d2352da5ce1433ef241faca8f40fa1fe27/mypy/semanal.py#L5905-L5910\r\n\r\nThis branch triggers when applying type args to a type that is generic with respect to a single `ParamSpec`. It allows double brackets to be omitted when providing a parameter specification by wrapping all of the provided type arguments into a single parameter specification argument (i.e. equating `Foo[int, int]` to `Foo[[int, int]]`). This wrapping occurs  *unless*:\r\n* there is only a single type argument, and it resolves to `Any` (e.g. `Foo[Any]`)\r\n* **there is only a single type argument**, and it's a bracketed parameter specification or a `ParamSpec` (e.g. `Foo[[int, int]]`)\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs when multiple type arguments provided and at least one of them is a bracketed parameter specification, as in `Foo[[int, int], str]`.\r\n\r\nPer the rules above, since there is more than 1 type argument, mypy attempts to wrap the arguments into a single parameter specification. This results in the attempted creation of a `Parameters` instance that contains another `Parameters` instance, which triggers this assert inside `Parameters.__init__`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/python/mypy/blob/72c413d2352da5ce1433ef241faca8f40fa1fe27/mypy/types.py#L1634\r\n\r\nI think a reasonable solution is to forgo wrapping the type arguments into a single `Parameters` if **any** of the provided type arguments are a `Parameters`/`ParamSpecType`. That is, don't transform `Foo[A1, A2, ...]` to `Foo[[A1, A2, ...]]` if any of `A1, A2, ...` are a parameter specification.\r\n\r\nThis change brings the crash case inline with mypy's current behavior for a similar case:\r\n```python\r\n# Current behavior\r\nP = ParamSpec(\"P\")\r\nclass C(Generic[P]): ...\r\nc: C[int, [int, str], str]  # E: Nested parameter specifications are not allowed\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this change:\r\n```python\r\nP = ParamSpec(\"P\")\r\nclass C(Generic[P]): ...\r\nclass D(C[int, [int, str], str]): ... # !!! CRASH !!!\r\n```\r\nAfter this change:\r\n```python\r\nP = ParamSpec(\"P\")\r\nclass C(Generic[P]): ...\r\nclass D(C[int, [int, str], str]): ... # E: Nested parameter specifications are not allowed\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nChecklist:\r\n- Read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- Add tests for all changed behaviour.\r\n- If you can't add a test, please explain why and how you verified your changes work.\r\n- Make sure CI passes.\r\n- Please do not force push to the PR once it has been reviewed.\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17770/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14350754966,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc6WaXr3zwAAAANXXySW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/14350754966","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-21T23:45:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14350754971,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc6WaXr3zwAAAANXXySb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/14350754971","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"9ffb9ddf80fbf92956a55946c8f023fc09638959","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/9ffb9ddf80fbf92956a55946c8f023fc09638959","created_at":"2024-09-21T23:45:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14350796174,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc6WaXr3zwAAAANXX8WO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/14350796174","actor":{"login":"Ali-Razmjoo","id":7676267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NzYyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7676267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ali-Razmjoo","html_url":"https://github.com/Ali-Razmjoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ali-Razmjoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ali-Razmjoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ali-Razmjoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ali-Razmjoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ali-Razmjoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ali-Razmjoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ali-Razmjoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ali-Razmjoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ali-Razmjoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9ffb9ddf80fbf92956a55946c8f023fc09638959","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fork-the-planet/mypy/commits/9ffb9ddf80fbf92956a55946c8f023fc09638959","created_at":"2024-09-22T00:15:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
