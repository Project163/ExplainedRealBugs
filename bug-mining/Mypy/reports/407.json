Consider the following dataclass:\r\n```python\r\n# module.py\r\nimport dataclasses\r\n\r\n\r\n@dataclasses.dataclass\r\nclass A:\r\n    foo: str\r\n    bar: str = \"default\"\r\n    baz: str = dataclasses.field(default=\"hidden default\", init=False)\r\n\r\n    def method(self, a: int) -> float:\r\n        return 0.0\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe resulting generated stubs are\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport dataclasses\r\n\r\n@dataclasses.dataclass\r\nclass A:\r\n    foo: str\r\n    bar: str = ...\r\n    baz: str = ...\r\n    def method(self, a: int) -> float: ...\r\n    def __init__(self, foo, bar) -> None: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the method `method` received the correct type hints. However, the `__init__` method did not. It correctly removed the `baz` parameter, as this has the `init=False` flag, but no type hints are present. Also, it does not reflect the fact, that `bar` is only an optional parameter. This leads to incorrect type hints when using this dataclass.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nRun `stubgen module.py`.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior could look something like this:\r\n```python\r\nimport dataclasses\r\n\r\n@dataclasses.dataclass\r\nclass A:\r\n    foo: str\r\n    bar: str = ...\r\n    baz: str = ...\r\n    def method(self, a: int) -> float: ...\r\n    def __init__(self, foo: str, bar: str = \"default\") -> None: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 1.8.0\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: none\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): none\r\n- Python version used: 3.8\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16811/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16811/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
