This makes it impossible to produce an exhaustive `if/elif/else` that can assert_never in the else case.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nhttps://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.11&gist=7b278f392c623c63fd5b576c483a0e3c\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nI should be able to write an `elif` clause that can `assert_type(cls, type[None])`.\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nCurrently there's no way to narrow a type `Union[type[None], T]` type.
