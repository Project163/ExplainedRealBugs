@zzzeek -- unfortunately, I'm not really the right person to ask about this :// I'm not actually on the mypy core team, and have only contributed a few documentation fixes to mypy -- I tend to contribute more towards the CPython & typeshed repos, I just stalk the mypy issue tracker from time to time 😄 Perhaps @hauntsaninja might be able to shed some more light?\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I think the approach typeshed has taken would probably serve you well! You could define a single `TypeVar` in a standalone module like this (let's call it `typing_utils`):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# typing_utils.py\r\nfrom typing import TypeVar\r\n\r\nSelf = TypeVar('Self')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, in the rest of your code base, you could use that `TypeVar` like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# foo.py\r\nfrom typing_utils import Self\r\n\r\nclass Foo:\r\n    def returns_self(self: Self) -> Self:\r\n        return self\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def returns_cls(cls: type[Self]) -> type[Self]:\r\n        return cls\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that way, you'd get type annotations that work perfectly for now; and if PEP 673 is accepted and implemented, you could quite easily run a single script using AST to clean up your code base, converting `Foo` into the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# foo.py\r\nfrom typing_extensions import Self\r\n\r\nclass Foo:\r\n    def returns_self(self) -> Self:\r\n        return self\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def returns_cls(cls) -> type[Self]:\r\n        return cls\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe old version of `Foo` (using pre-PEP 673 syntax) and the new version (using PEP 673 syntax) would have semantically identical type annotations from mypy's perspective.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1003209037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexWaygood","id":66076021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDc2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66076021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexWaygood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5829309701,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAGuhRc5BA6H7zwAAAAFbdDUF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/5829309701","actor":{"login":"zzzeek","id":128223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/128223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek","html_url":"https://github.com/zzzeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-30T23:13:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5829309704,"node_id":"SE_lADOAGuhRc5BA6H7zwAAAAFbdDUI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/5829309704","actor":{"login":"zzzeek","id":128223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/128223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek","html_url":"https://github.com/zzzeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-30T23:13:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5829309706,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAGuhRc5BA6H7zwAAAAFbdDUK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/5829309706","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-30T23:13:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5829309709,"node_id":"SE_lADOAGuhRc5BA6H7zwAAAAFbdDUN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/5829309709
