planning to release mypy 0.900 some time in March. This release will have a particularly significant change, as third-party stubs are no longer shipped with mypy. They need to be installed by installing suitable stub packages. For example, `pip install types-requests` installs the stubs for Requests. Mypy will suggest the names of stub packages to install, and `mypy --install-types` will automatically install the suggested stub packages (this doesn't work with the mypy daemon, however).\r\n\r\nSince this change is potentially quite disruptive, I'm announcing the release here well ahead of the target release date.\r\n\r\nThe unbundling of typeshed is already implemented in GitHub master, so it's possible to start testing this right now. If you can, please try using a development version and report how it went. You can find pre-built wheels here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mypyc/mypy_mypyc-wheels/releases\r\n\r\nI'll probably cut the release branch around mid-March (but this is still very

has to be specified as a per-module option, if the library used\r\nto have bundled stubs. This way mypy won't silently start ignoring\r\nthese missing stubs.\r\n\r\nThis makes `ignore_missing_imports` special by making it work a bit\r\ndifferently, depending on whether it's set globally or per module.\r\n\r\nThe new behavior is less surprising. This makes it possible to ignore\r\narbitrary missing third-party stub packages, even those which used to\r\nhave bundled stubs.\r\n\r\nFixes #10283.\r\n\r\nOriginally implemented by @TheCleric in #10283. This is somewhat \r\nsimpler alternative implementation which is easier to reason about and\r\nmay perform better in some cases of very large configs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10582/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4844299942,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDg0NDI5OTk0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/4844299942","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-04T16:51:26Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4844300033,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ4NDQzMDAwMzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/4844300033","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4642a31bdd437edc2ebe788cc6deb3214f06d997","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/4642a31bdd437edc2ebe788cc6deb3214f06d997","created_at":"2021-06-04T16:51:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4853149283,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ4NTMxNDkyODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/4853149283","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"be5aed74066dcc9ed53999ef96b3ba37fd4068e5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/be5aed74066dcc9ed53999ef96b3ba37fd4068e5","created_at":"2021-06-07T16:27:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
