It fixes the crash that it was meant to fix, but I get some very strange mypy errors if I try changing `builtins.pyi` in typeshed so that it imports things from `collections.abc` instead of `typing`, so something is clearly going wrong there. Plus the crash is very typeshed-specific, so it's not really high-priority.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it's not a clean
