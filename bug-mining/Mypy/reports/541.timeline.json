Summary\r\n\r\nAddressed issue #16286, which reported that `match` statements failed to narrow unions when matching on discriminant values (e.g. `tag` fields in `TypedDict`s or classes). This led to mypy complaining about missing keys/attributes inside `case` blocks even though plain `if ... ==` branches worked.\r\n\r\n### What changed?\r\n- **Binder fix in `mypy/checker.py`:**\r\n  - In `visit_match_stmt`, after calling `conditional_types_to_typemaps` for the subject, the resulting type map is passed through `propagate_up_typemap_info` (just like in the `if`/`isinstance` code paths). This means if the subject is an attribute or index expression (`d.tag` / `d[\"tag\"]`), we try to refine the parent `d` based on the pattern.\r\n  - Corrected indentation and ensured we only push `pattern_map` when it's defined, to avoid `UnboundLocalError` in unreachable branches.\r\n- **New tests in `test-data/unit/check-python310.test`:**\r\n  - `testMatchNarrowingUnionTypedDictViaIndex` checks that `match d[\"tag\"]` refines a `TypedDict` union and allows access to the appropriate key in each branch.\r\n  - `testMatchNarrowingUnionClassViaAttribute` checks the same for a class union using `match d.tag`.\r\n- **Changelog:** Added a short bullet under “Next Release” describing the bug fix.\r\n\r\n### Why?\r\nPreviously, the binder only narrowed the type of the expression being matched (e.g. `d[\"tag\"]`), not the parent expression. Without propagating that information upwards, mypy didn't realize it could rule out unrelated `TypedDict`/class variants in each `case`, leading to erroneous `typeddict-item` and `union-attr` errors. The fix mirrors the existing behaviour for `if` and similar checks.\r\n\r\n### How was it tested?\r\n- Ran `pytest -k testMatchNarrowingUnionTypedDictViaIndex` and `pytest -k testMatchNarrowingUnionClassViaAttribute` to confirm the new tests passed.\r\n- Ran `pytest -k check-python310` to ensure the entire pattern-matching suite still passes after the change.\r\n- Ran the mypy self-check (`python runtests.py self`).\r\n- Ran `pre-commit run --all-files` to satisfy formatting and lint hooks.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] Added regression tests for the reported bug.\r\n- [x] Verified new tests fail on the unpatched code and pass with the fix.\r\n- [x] Ran mypy’s self-check and relevant pytest suites.\r\n- [x] Updated `CHANGELOG.md`.\r\n- [x] Ran pre-commit hooks.\r\n\r\nFixes #16286.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis PR was generated by an AI system in collaboration with maintainers: @hauntsaninja","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18791/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16752253803,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc50PO85zwAAAAPmgxtr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/16752253803","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-14T01:30:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
