package as having type info.\r\n* Handle merges and special tokens in `convert.py`\r\n* `--vocab-only` in `convert.py` can work without the actual model tensors being available or in the correct format (i.e. git LFS links). (But guessed params can no longer be used in vocab only mode.)\r\n* `gguf.py` tensor name mapping refactored. This also allows simpler tensor skipping.\r\n* falcon converter accepts `--vocab-only`\r\n\r\n(Not a 100% complete list of changes.)\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nCompleted (unless someone speaks

type argument inference for overloaded functions with explicit self types. Filter out the overload items based on the declared and actual types of self. The implementation is best effort and does the filtering only in simple cases, to reduce the risk of regressions (primarily performance, but I worry also about infinite recursion). I added a fast path for the typical case, since without it the filtering was quite expensive.\r\n\r\nNote that the overload item filtering already worked in many contexts. This only improves it in specific contexts -- at least when inferring generic protocol compatibility.\r\n\r\nThis is a more localized (and thus lower-risk) fix compared to #14975 (thanks @tyralla!). #14975 might still be a good idea, but I'm not comfortable merging it now, and I want a quick fix to unblock the mypy 1.12 release.\r\n\r\nFixes #15031.
