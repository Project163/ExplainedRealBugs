were couple of problems with static checks generating source\r\nfiles including generated stubs in the common.sql package:\r\n\r\n* black formatting was implemented in multiple separate scripts\r\n  making it harded to fix problems in all of them\r\n* generated stub files were not formatted with is_pyi=True and\r\n  black had no way to figure it out because it was working on strings\r\n* black formatting was not consistently applied in all places\r\n* EOL at the end of generated stub file was missing, leading to EOL\r\n  fixer adding them after generation leading to multiple pre-commit\r\n  passes needed\r\n* there was (already unused) deprecated dev dict generator that used\r\n  its own black formatting.\r\n\r\nThere were also couple of problems with the files generated by\r\nstubgen itself:\r\n\r\n* Union was missing in the generated stubs (this is a known issue\r\n  with stubgen: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12929\r\n* Intellij complained on Incomplete import from _typeshed missing\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes all the problems:\r\n\r\n* black formatting is now consistenly extracted and applied everywhere\r\n* when needed, is_pyi flag is passed to black so that it knows\r\n  that .pyi file is being fomratted\r\n* EOL is added at the end of file when the file is generated\r\n* Union is added to the generated stub\r\n* noqa is added to _typeshed import\r\n* the dict generator is removed\r\n\r\nAs the end result, generated stub files are fully importable\r\n(no errors reported by IntelliJ IDE) and consistently formatted\r\nevery time.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you
