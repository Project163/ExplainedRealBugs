Report**\r\n\r\nMypy does not respect the `--ignore-missing-imports` flag/`ignore_missing_imports = True` config for types that are now modularized out of typeshed (eg the [`legacy_bundled_packages`](http://github.com/FuegoFro/mypy/blob/98edc4148ac9fb3bdb601419ab2bafbac848fc6c/mypy/stubinfo.py#L4-L86)).\r\n\r\nI don't *think* this is a typeshed bug, but let me know if you disagree and I can make an issue there instead.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nGiven the following file:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom redis.sentinel import Sentinel\r\n```\r\n\r\nI always get the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython -m mypy --ignore-missing-imports example.py\r\nexample.py:1: error: Library stubs not installed for \"redis.sentinel\" (or incompatible with Python 3.7)\r\nexample.py:1: note: Hint: \"python3 -m pip install types-redis\"\r\nexample.py:1: note: (or run \"mypy --install-types\" to install all missing stub packages)\r\nexample.py:1: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#missing-imports\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter whether `--ignore-missing-imports` is included or whether `types-redis` is installed, it will always give me exactly that output.\r\n\r\nNote that a line like `from foo_asdf import bar` *is* correctly ignored by the `--ignore-missing-imports` flag and types that *are* defined by `types-redis` (like `redis.StrictRedis`) will work correctly (with or without the flag) when that package is installed.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: `mypy 0.820+dev.e46aa6df6126cf47bea97bf9f94d7cba093d0103` (latest `master` at time of filing)\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: `--ignore-missing-imports`\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): N/A\r\n- Python version used: Python 3.7.6\r\n- Operating system and version: macOS 10.15.7\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10283/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
