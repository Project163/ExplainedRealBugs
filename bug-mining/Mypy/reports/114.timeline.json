Since some of the monkeypatched tests block with that, they'll have to be adjusted - see [@a3f15f9](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/pull/2731/commits/a3f15f9921d7c2bc4b4681b6ce149eb04a76a817)\r\n- [x] update sphinx to [`4.5.0`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/changes.html#release-4-5-0-released-mar-28-2022)\r\n- [x] migrate to pre-commit.ci for pre-commit tests\r\n- [x] maybe add `isort` to the pre-commit setup","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/issues/2925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/issues/2925/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6284855414,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5DDkOSzwAAAAF2m0h2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6284855414","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-22T15:53:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6284855639,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5DDkOSzwAAAAF2m0lX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6284855639","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9551b93d843ec958b7ce35e957c42d392fc0697e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/9551b93d843ec958b7ce35e957c42d392fc0697e","created_at":"2022-03-22T15:53:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6284867647,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5DDkOSzwAAAAF2m3g_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6284867647","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7e09c2a100209072429e290d2f7b9b8007b8629c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/7e09c2a100209072429e290d2f7b9b8007b8629c","created_at":"2022-03-22T15:58:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
