Attempting to use stubtest with `--custom-typeshed-dir` pointing to a local clone of typeshed will result in the following message (or something like it):\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: not checking stubs due to failed mypy compile:\r\nmypy: \"..\\typeshed\\stdlib\\builtins.pyi\" shadows library module \"builtins\"\r\nnote: A user-defined top-level module with name \"builtins\" is not supported\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes on the bug:\r\n\r\n- I haven't been able to reproduce this using \"mypy core\", only with stubtest.\r\n- The bug exists on both mypy `master` and mypy `release-0.980`.\r\n- The bug exists if you use a relative path or an absolute path to point to a clone of typeshed.\r\n- The bug exists if you use the `--check-typeshed` flag, as well as if you don't.\r\n- I bisected to https://github.com/python/mypy/commit/c0372cc318dc35b25d4fe524b59f20b1244382a3 (https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/13629)\r\n\r\nCc. @ilevkivskyi, @jhance, @hauntsaninja\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nAny of the following will reproduce:\r\n\r\n- `(venv) python -m mypy.stubtest typed_ast --custom-typeshed-dir relative/path/to/typeshed`\r\n- `(venv) python -m mypy.stubtest typed_ast --custom-typeshed-dir absolute/path/to/typeshed`\r\n- `(venv) python -m mypy.stubtest --check-typeshed --custom-typeshed-dir relative/path/to/typeshed`\r\n- `(venv) python -m mypy.stubtest --check-typeshed --custom-typeshed-dir absolute/path/to/typeshed`\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nStubtest with `--custom-typeshed-dir` would work on mypy master.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nStubtest with `--custom-typeshed-dir` did not work on mypy master.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Python version used: 3.10.6\r\n- Operating system and version: Windows\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13654/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
