sure whether this is actually a bug or not, but I'm getting a base class incompatibility error when inheriting from two classes defining a method with the same signature containing the `typing.Self` type.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Self\r\n\r\nclass A:\r\n    def a_method(self) -> None:\r\n        pass\r\n    def method(self: Self, other: Self) -> None:\r\n        self.a_method()\r\n        other.a_method()\r\n\r\nclass B:\r\n    def b_method(self) -> None:\r\n        pass\r\n    def method(self: Self, other: Self) -> None:\r\n        self.b_method()\r\n        other.b_method()\r\n\r\nclass C(A, B):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `mypy` gives this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest.py:17: error: Definition of \"method\" in base class \"A\" is incompatible with definition in base class \"B\"  [misc]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected `Self` to mean \"whatever this type happens to be\" (base class or subclass) but the error would suggest that it's interpreting `Self` as the specific class containing that method definition.\r\n\r\nNext I tried the following variation:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import TypeVar\r\n\r\nT = TypeVar('T')\r\n\r\nclass A:\r\n    def a_method(self) -> None:\r\n        pass\r\n    def method(self: T, other: T) -> None:\r\n        self.a_method()\r\n\r\nclass B:\r\n    def b_method(self) -> None:\r\n        pass\r\n    def method(self: T, other: T) -> None:\r\n        self.b_method()\r\n\r\nclass C(A, B):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fixes the incompatibility error but results in new errors:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest.py:9: error: \"T\" has no attribute \"a_method\"  [attr-defined]\r\ntest.py:15: error: \"T\" has no attribute \"b_method\"  [attr-defined]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also tried using two separate `TypeVar`s, one with `bound='A'` and the other with `bound='B'`, but this brought back the \"incompatible definition\" error from before.\r\n\r\nFinally (after reverting the types back to `Self`), I updated `C`'s definition to the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass C(A, B):\r\n    def method(self: Self, other: Self) -> None:\r\n        A.method(self, other)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ended up type-checking, but I'm wondering if `mypy` ought to be clever enough to figure it out without having to explicitly override `method`, or if there's some other alternative?\r\n\r\nAnd if not, perhaps the error message about the incompatible definition could elaborate a bit more in the case where the type signatures \"appear\" to match due to the use of `Self`?\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n- Python 3.11.11\r\n- `mypy` 1.14.1 (no flags or config file)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18458/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
