Here is a minimal reproducible example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n_DictReadMapping = dict\r\n\r\nclass Foo(_DictReadMapping[str, int]): ...  # error: \"dict\" is not subscriptable\r\nBar = _DictReadMapping[int, str]  # error: \"dict\" is not subscriptable\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following, however, do *not* cause an error in Python <= 3.8 in a `.pyi` stub file:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n_DictReadMapping = dict\r\n\r\nBaz: _DictReadMapping[str, int]  # type alias used as an annotation: okay\r\nclass Spam(dict[str, int]): ...  # `dict` used as superclass without a type alias: okay\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nIn Python <= 3.8, `dict` is not subscriptable at runtime. However, it *should* be subscriptable in a `.pyi` stub file, which does not need to ever be \"run\". Moreover, it *is* subscriptable in a `.pyi` file if a type alias is not being used. The behaviour should  be the same, whether or not you are using a type alias.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\nThis bug [has been reproduced](https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/6723/checks) on MacOS, Ubuntu and Windows on Python 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. The mypy version being used is 0.930.\r\n\r\n**Use case**\r\n\r\nI came across this bug in an early draft of https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/6717. As you can see, using this kind of syntax [fails the typeshed CI for mypy](https://github.com/python/typeshed/runs/4652103219?check_suite_focus=true), but not for any other type checker. (In this case, there was an easy workaround.)","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11859/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
