Description\r\n\r\nFixes #12544.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, mypy crashes on the following code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\r\nfrom typing_extensions import TypeAlias\r\n\r\nclass Foo: ...\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass A:\r\n    S: TypeAlias = Foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because mypy's `dataclasses` plugin does not currently account for the possibility of a `TypeAlias` node being inside a dataclass definition.\r\n\r\nAt runtime, [no special treatment is given](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/91322) to fields annotated with `TypeAlias` -- they're treated just like normal instance fields with default values. As such, this PR proposes that mypy:\r\n\r\n1. Always emits an error on encountering a `TypeAlias` node inside a dataclass definition (it probably won't have the behaviour the user expects).\r\n2. Infers the type of the field as `type[X]` in simple cases such as `S: TypeAlias = int`.\r\n3. Falls back to `Any` for anything more complex, such as `S: TypeAlias = Callable[[int], str]`.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nI added tests.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12792/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6650714716,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5HUN3FzwAAAAGMadpc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6650714716","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-20T13:27:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6650714980,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5HUN3FzwAAAAGMadtk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6650714980","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e612e440103ec7abdc40d0e41115701362abad21","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/e612e440103ec7abdc40d0e41115701362abad21","created_at":"2022-05-20T13:27:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6650723433,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5HUN3FzwAAAAGMafxp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6650723433","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cb2c07bd1b0cb8ff3dbf38d0ee2092ebc1c1162f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/cb2c07bd1b0cb8ff3dbf38d0ee2092ebc1c1162f","created_at":"2022-05-20T13:29:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
