the current version in pypi (1.2.0) via `python -m pip install -U mypy` reproduces this issue.\r\nInstalling from zipball works however! Tried the following:\r\nmaster (1.4.0+dev) via `python -m pip install -U https://github.com/python/mypy/zipball/master` seems to work.\r\nrelease-1.2 (1.2.0) via `python -m pip install -U https://github.com/python/mypy/zipball/release-1.2` seems to work.\r\nrelease-1.1 (1.1.0) via `python -m pip install -U https://github.com/python/mypy/zipball/release-1.1` seems to work.\r\n(Stopped existing daemons, and uninstalled mypy between each step. Also tried reinstalling pypi mypy and the issue happens again)\r\n\r\npypi wheel it's using: mypy-1.2.0-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl\r\n ","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1540885961/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"svalentin","id":250871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/250871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin","html_url":"https://github.com/svalentin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1540914474","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14671#issuecomment-1540914474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14671","id":1540914474,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5b2H0q","user":{"login":"svalentin","id":250871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/250871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin","html_url":"https://github.com/svalentin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svalentin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-09T21:26:43Z","updated_at":"2023-05-09T21:29:38Z","body":"The only significant difference between zipball release-1.2 and pypi 1.2 is the *.pyc and *.pyd files.
