change, because in runtime `token` is not a member by default, at least in recent python versions. Proof:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# 3.14\r\n>>> from enum import Enum\r\n>>> class Empty(Enum):\r\n...     token = lambda x: x\r\n...     \r\n>>> Empty.token\r\n<function Empty.<lambda> at 0x101251250>\r\n>>> Empty.token.value\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# 3.11\r\n>>> from enum import Enum\r\n>>> class Empty(Enum):\r\n...     token = lambda x: x\r\n... \r\n>>> Empty.token\r\n<function Empty.<lambda> at 0x104757600>\r\n>>> Empty.token.value\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nAttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'value'\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I had to add `member()` there to make the test pass.\r\n\r\nI will continue to improve enums support in the future :)\r\nFor example, we need to support `_ignore_` values and some other corner cases.
