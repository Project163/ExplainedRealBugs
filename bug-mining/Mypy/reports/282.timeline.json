think a few libraries that are checked by mypy-primer use pandas. It might be nice to install pandas-stubs as a dependency for those projects.\r\n\r\nBackground: It might be nice if pandas-stubs would use mypy-primer in the (far?) future. Especially if pandas-stubs is promoted by mypy https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14328 I have absolutely no idea how difficult it would be to integrate a mypy-primer run for pandas-stubs PRs (ideally it would only need to be run on projects that actually use pandas) but I think the first step is to add pandas-stubs as a dependency :)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hauntsaninja/mypy_primer/issues/74/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hauntsaninja/mypy_primer/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1410695768","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14328#issuecomment-1410695768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14328","id":1410695768,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5UFYJY","user":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-31T16:29:55Z","updated_at":"2023-01-31T16:31:48Z","body":"It seems reasonable to loosen the rules a bit.

reviewing #372 , it uncovered that by having `check()` use `next(iter())`, if you have a `Series([1,2,3], dtype=np.int8)`, it was not checking that the actual type of the first element was `np.int8`, since `Series.__iter__()` returns a python scalar.\r\n\r\nSo this corrects that, allowing us to be more precise in the type checking of the values inside the results, since we want to check that `astype()` is doing what we expect.\r\n\r\nAlso, was able to allow `pytables` to work with 3.11, since they released a compatible version.\r\n\r\nUncovered an odd issue with bitwise operations on lists of `int`\r\n\r\nIn some cases, used `np.integer` because it is a supertype that works across platforms.  Other times, `np.int_` worked fine.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs/issues/546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pandas-dev/pandas-stubs/issues/546/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-18T07:13:26Z","updated_at":"2023-10-18T07:13:26Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16284","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16284/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16284/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16284/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16284","id":1949001610,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGuhRc5dGhGR","number":16284,"title":"Suggest
