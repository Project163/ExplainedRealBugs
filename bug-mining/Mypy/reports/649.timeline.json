#19468\r\n\r\nBased on earlier PR #19473\r\n\r\n- refactored the `conditional_types` function. \r\n  - return `UninhabitedType(), default` when no ranges are given. This corresponds to `isinstance(x, ())`, with an empty tuple, which always returns `False` at runtime.\r\n  - when the type is a union, factorize the yes type `isinstance(A|B, C) -> yes = A_yes | B_yes` (note: this does **not** apply to the no-type generally, see <https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/19473#discussion_r2234043360>\r\n- modified  #19473 to change the proposed type, rather than directly returning. This is essential to maintain the behavior of the unit test `testIsinstanceWithOverlappingPromotionTypes`\r\n- Allow `TypeChecker.get_isinstance_type` to return empty list (fixes `isinstance(x, ())` behavior).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Modified tests\r\n\r\n- `testIsInstanceWithEmtpy2ndArg` now correctly infers unreachable for `isinstance(x, ())`.\r\n- `testNarrowingUnionMixins` now predicts the same results as [pyright playground](https://pyright-play.net/?strict=true&reportUnreachable=true&code=MQAg2gxghgzgpiALnGiByUBOmD2B3ASwDsBzAVSIJyIFkCAPYmAXQCgIAbWGEAIVjgAuEADox7LjB4AxHDjqMig1iFUgAJnABmILXIAU8DloCUIALQA%2BEGmpDR4ztz5YFxZWo3aQAIyyG4YzMrGzthMRFWTR0-AC99AmQAW2F%2BeGDrWyIhFTUCHSIcRBACGCZEKCIIOATkgBoQfVl5BmIG-kw3IhMTD081TChSuFZc1Uw4ADc4KA4AfUQATwAHGsS4JLMQUDRhACUpmY44dSQVhFKQACIKKiIwObmkoaJHkQAeGABXHycpEBwOiuj2exDeaTgVxAlVOwKeLzezS6V0sDRBCLmH2%2Bv0kPEB13RYMxEKhMIJ8KJIg6yMszCuYxKOlK5Uq1VqGwaSNa3T6-RAE2mswW53Zm1UO32h1mJzOqxKPDhoNemK5inpfNU6ySIj0OH0JgZgXgvP6AqOwtWoq2EpAB0Fx1OSzll0VGKxPz%2BeKBhOVVIEpKIsJ94Nc3JR6o1WpEfkw%2BqAA), https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.12&gist=734c95f128705cfb0dc4ce24f1ad8eec\r\n\r\n## New Tests\r\n\r\n- `testMatchNarrowDownUnionUsingClassPattern` (https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=1.17.0&python=3.12&gist=e9ec514f49903022bd32a82ae1774abd)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19517/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19517/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20467635463,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc7A9euLzwAAAATD91UH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/20467635463","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-23T22:21:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20468279656,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc7A9euLzwAAAATEASlo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/20468279656","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fb16e938d12f6b24b5edf8023d4adf8e0e36abb4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spencerx/mypy/commits/fb16e938d12f6b24b5edf8023d4adf8e0e36abb4","created_at":"2025-10-23T23:09:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
