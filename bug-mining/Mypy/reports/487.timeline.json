When checking for narrowing in `if` clause by `is None`, we explicitly request to not consider bare `TypeVar` overlapping with `None`. The obvious decision is to stop asking for that, but... There's a test asserting this behaviour (introduced in #5476, and `if` clause is indeed unreachable - using a non-trivial body gives an `[unreachable]` diagnostic with `--warn-unreachable`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/python/mypy/blob/3b00002acdf098e7241df8f2e1843f8b8260b168/test-data/unit/check-isinstance.test#L2210-L2227\r\n\r\nI don't think that this approach is sound: narrowing a lone TypeVar is a common problem, it shouldn't erroneously mark code as unreachable.\r\n \r\n`binder` builds a Union of types after all non-terminating branches when exiting a frame, so here it produces `None | T` (`None` from the `if` clause since it's reachable, and `T` from a pass-through). \r\n\r\nI tried to modify the binder to keep track of whether every type in frame was updated via an  `isinstance` check or by assignment, and this seems to work as expected. I'm not sure, however, that this approach covers all corner cases. We already know that `TypeVar + isinstance` causes a lot of pain (#9424 and many others), so this probably won't make things marginally worse.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2466580907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sterliakov","id":50529348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTI5MzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50529348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov","html_url":"https://github.com/sterliakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"sterliakov","id":50529348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTI5MzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50529348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov","html_url":"https://github.com/sterliakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-10T17:55:55Z","updated_at":"2024-11-10T17:55:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18138","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18138/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18138/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18138/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18138","id":2647481230,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGuhRc6BbztA","number":18138,"title":"Do
