(Technically it is ``T`-1`` and ``T`1`` but mypy does not expose these names.) You can reproduce using two separate type variables as well:\r\n```python\r\nT = TypeVar('T')\r\nS = TypeVar('S')\r\n\r\nclass C(Generic[T]):\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    def get() -> T: ...\r\n\r\ndef func(x: S) -> S:\r\n    return C[S].get()  # E: Incompatible return value type (got \"T\", expected \"S\")  [return-value]\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerally you'd use `@classmethod` for this kind of thing, and mypy handles this edge case correctly:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nT = TypeVar('T')\r\n\r\nclass C(Generic[T]):\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def c(cls: 'type[C[T]]') -> 'C[T]':\r\n        return

[arg-type]\r\nFound 4 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nThere should be no errors. (In fact, this worked correctly until mypy 0.950.)\r\n\r\nThe first and third errors make little sense since `Type[Evens[T]]` is a special case of `Type[Parent[T]]`.\r\n\r\nThe second and fourth errors make even less sense, since `Sequence[T]` is exactly the same as `Sequence[T]`.\r\n\r\nIf there is actually some kind of problem here, the error messages need to be much more helpful than they currently are.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: master, 0.981\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: --strict --warn-unreachable --show-error-codes\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): N/A\r\n- Python version used: 3.10, 3.8\r\n\r\n<!-- You can freely edit this text, please remove all the lines you believe are unnecessary. -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14061/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14061/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
