Report**\r\n\r\nWhen there is only one member of the enum, `mypy` doesn't perform full exhaustiveness checking and reaches `assert_never` statement, although it shouldn't.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n[mypy-play link](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.12&gist=8c4c845f4b94692acf880b4b99b3e8ce)\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\n`mypy` does not complain and reports no errors\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n`mypy` reaches unreachable code and complains\r\n\r\n`main.py:15: error: Argument 1 to \"assert_never\" has incompatible type \"A\"; expected \"NoReturn\"  [arg-type]`\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\nPlayground\r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\n\r\nWhile having an enum with only one member is definitely a contrived example, it is a valid example nonetheless. This popped up for me while I was implementing a feature partially for just one case of an enum first with the plan of filing up more enum cases later on.\r\n\r\nNote that this is specific for enums with one member only, if you have a `Literal` with only one member, `mypy` correctly deduces that unreachable code is truly unreachable. If you have an enum with multiple members (and an appropriate match-case block), the unreachable code is also correctly deduced.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16922/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16922/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20360606893,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5WeGThzwAAAAS9ljSt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/20360606893","actor":{"login":"whoami730","id":107390598,"node_id":"U_kgDOBmamhg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/107390598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/whoami730","html_url":"https://github.com/whoami730","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whoami730/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whoami730/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whoami730/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whoami730/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whoami730/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whoami730/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whoami730/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whoami730/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/whoami730/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"afa468ab6ccb2b17889091d269a418ce4f567d45","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/whoami730/cyright/commits/afa468ab6ccb2b17889091d269a418ce4f567d45","created_at":"2025-10-18T14:27:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
