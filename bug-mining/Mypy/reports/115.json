Create the following file\r\n```python\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass A:\r\n    prop_a: str\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass B:\r\n    prop_b: bool\r\n\r\nclass Derived(A, B):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run `mypy .` and observe the error:\r\n```\r\ntest.py:11: error: Cannot override final attribute \"__match_args__\" (previously declared in base class \"B\")\r\ntest.py:11: error: Cannot override writable attribute \"__match_args__\" with a final one\r\ntest.py:11: error: Definition of \"__match_args__\" in base class \"A\" is incompatible with definition in base class \"B\"\r\nFound 3 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nGiven that I did not set `__match_args__` myself makes this error really hard to understand. I would have expected no such error to occur, especially as the code should work for older Python versions that don't support pattern matching yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 0.940\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: none\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): none\r\n- Python version used: 3.10\r\n- Operating system and version: Linux, Fedora 35\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12349/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12349/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
