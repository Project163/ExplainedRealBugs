Technically speaking, `def set_log_level(v):` does have `self`, it is just named `v`.\r\nThis partly-implicit naming convention hunts me for a little while 😄 \r\n\r\nI see two major opportunities here:\r\n- Force users to have `self` argument in methods. Breaking change, might generate lots of false positives for custom `@staticmethod` / `@classmethod` decorators, etc.\r\n- Add `note: ` output to this error where we explain that when calling `Instance.method(arg)` we see that the first argument is not `self` and it is possibly missing.
