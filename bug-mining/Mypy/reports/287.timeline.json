I'm just somewhat hesitant to make that change here, given that these tests have been in place for 10 years or more -- it could be the case that many people are depending on this being established mypy behaviour. The fact that two tests assert the same behaviour indicates that it _was_ a deliberate decision, even if we might disagree with that decision now.\r\n\r\nFixing the original bug in this issue thread while maintaining the behaviour asserted in these two tests actually appears to be fairly trivial, so for now, I'm planning on opening a PR to do that. I'll open a followup issue after that to discuss whether the behaviour that's asserted in these two tests should be

#14819.\r\n\r\nMypy currently silently infers an `Any` type when unpacking an iterator that doesn't explicitly inherit from `typing.Iterator` (i.e., an iterator that's a _structural_ subtype of `typing.Iterator`, but not a _nominal_ subtype):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import TypeVar\r\n\r\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\r\n\r\nclass Foo:\r\n    count: int\r\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\r\n        self.count = 0\r\n    def __iter__(self: T) -> T:\r\n        return self\r\n    def __next__(self) -> int:\r\n        self.count += 1\r\n        if self.count > 3:\r\n            raise StopIteration\r\n        return self.count\r\n\r\na, b, c = Foo()\r\nreveal_type(a)  # note: Revealed type is \"Any\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, we have enough information here to infer that the type of `a` should really be `int`. This PR fixes that bug.\r\n\r\nThere's discussion on the issue thread about an alternative solution that would involve changing some mypy behaviour that's been established for around 10 years. For now, I haven't gone for that solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14821/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8658903701,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5fxnlkzwAAAAIEHGKV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/8658903701","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-03T11:29:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8658904344,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5fxnlkzwAAAAIEHGUY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/8658904344","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"456dcbdd6a2f9b36249e0e7d31e521f5678a8235","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/456dcbdd6a2f9b36249e0e7d31e521f5678a8235","created_at":"2023-03-03T11:29:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1453476701","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14819#issuecomment-1453476701","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14819","id":1453476701,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5Woktd","user":{"login":"AlexWaygood","id":66076021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDc2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66076021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexWaygood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-03T12:41:44Z","updated_at":"2023-03-03T12:41:44Z","body":"@sterliakov, the behaviour does appear to be consistent with some other parts of mypy also.
