Which issue(s) does this change fix?\r\n<!-- Use the format #<issue-number>, e.g. #42 -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Why is this change necessary?\r\nSince we introduced `ruamel` as a dependency, running `make pr` fails every other time because of an issue in `mypy`\r\nE.g.:\r\n```\r\ntests/unit/lib/sync/flows/test_rest_api_sync_flow.py:1: error: Skipping analyzing 'ruamel': found module but no type hints or library stubs\r\ntests/unit/lib/sync/flows/test_http_api_sync_flow.py:1: error: Skipping analyzing 'ruamel': found module but no type hints or library stubs\r\ntests/unit/lib/sync/flows/test_function_sync_flow.py:1: error: Skipping analyzing 'ruamel': found module but no type hints or library stubs\r\nsamcli/lib/sync/flows/zip_function_sync_flow.py:1: error: Skipping analyzing 'ruamel': found module but no type hints or library stubs\r\n```\r\nIssue in `mypy`:\r\n- https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12664\r\n\r\n#### How does it address the issue?\r\nApply `--no-incredental` as a workaround to not use mypy's cachcing mechanism. So it doesn't hit the error.\r\n\r\n#### What side effects does this change have?\r\n`mypy`/`make lint` could run slower since it forces mypy to not use caching.\r\n\r\nNote that in our CI/CD jobs, `mypy` is run only once. So we won't have any issue in our CI/CD jobs.\r\nThis change helps smoothing the local dev experience a bit because mypy fixes the issue. \r\n\r\n#### Mandatory Checklist\r\n**PRs will only be reviewed after checklist is complete**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add input/output [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) to new functions/methods\r\n- [ ] Write design document if needed ([Do I need to write a design document?](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/blob/develop/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md#design-document))\r\n- [ ] Write/update unit tests\r\n- [ ] Write/update integration tests\r\n- [ ] Write/update functional tests if needed\r\n- [x] `make pr` passes\r\n- [ ] `make update-reproducible-reqs` if dependencies were changed\r\n- [ ] Write documentation\r\n\r\nBy submitting this pull request, I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/4534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/4534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1486999268","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12664#issuecomment-1486999268","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12664","id":1486999268,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5Yoc7k","user":{"login":"sfc-gh-dschumann","id":79480708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDgwNzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79480708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dschumann","html_url":"https://github.com/sfc-gh-dschumann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dschumann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dschumann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dschumann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dschumann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dschumann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dschumann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dschumann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dschumann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfc-gh-dschumann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-28T14:26:29Z","updated_at":"2023-03-28T14:26:29Z","body":"Hitting the same issue.

work)","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2742484522/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-21T06:46:20Z","updated_at":"2025-03-21T06:46:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/7276","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/7276/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/7276/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/7276/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/7276","id":475078142,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzUwNzgxNDI=","number":7276,"title":"\"Intermittent\"

for the title. I try to explain myself better.\r\n\r\nI have found a strange behaviour in `mypy` related to an import error in a imported module. That is, an error in a module 'b' importing a module 'c' while checking module 'a', which imports 'b'. 'c', of course, is a 3rd party package.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, `mypy` reports nothing on a first round. But if it is run again, it reported a `error: Cannot find module named 'c'`. On a third run, nothing is reported again, while on a fourth run the error re-appears, and so on...\r\n\r\nThis happens even when the type check has been disabled in the import line.\r\n\r\nA possible scenario to reproduce this \"bug\" is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Create a 'strange_report' package (with an empty `__init__.py`).\r\n\r\n2. Create a subpackage called 'a' inside 'strange_report' (with an empty `__init__.py` too).\r\n\r\n3. Write an `a.py` module (importer module) such as:\r\n```\r\nfrom a.b import B\r\n\r\nb = B()  # just for visually check that a.py was run\r\n```\r\n4. Write a `b.py` module (imported module)\r\n```\r\nfrom ruamel.yaml import YAMLError  # type: ignore\r\n\r\n\r\nclass B:\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        print(f\"New 'B' object {self} has been created\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Open terminal and change to directory 'strange_report'.\r\n\r\n6. Module `a.py` can be run with `python -m a.a`\r\n\r\n7. If you run `mypy a/a.py` for the first time, you do not get any reports (however, directory '.mypy_cache' is created).\r\n\r\n8. But if you run `mypy a/a.py` once again, you get an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmadera:strange_error jv$ mypy a/a.py\r\na/b.py:1: error: Cannot find module named 'ruamel'\r\na/a.py:1: error: Cannot find module named 'ruamel'\r\na/a.py:1: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running_mypy.html#missing-imports\r\n```\r\n9. You can repeat 7. and 8. again and again with similar results. Same results are gotten with or without `# type: ignore`.\r\n\r\nHowever, **if cache directory '.mypy_cache' is deleted** before running mypy every time, it **does not report anything**.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, if you check `mypy a/b.py` it consistently reports nothing.\r\n\r\nI am running on:\r\n\r\n- macOS HIgh Sierra 10.13.6\r\n- Python 3.7.4\r\n- mypy 0.720\r\n- ruamel.yaml 0.16.0 (so, yes, ruamel.yaml is installed; I use this 3rd party package because it is causing the bug in my system; no any particular purposes, I imagined that same bug can appeared with similar packages but cannot confirm that)\r\n- Any mypy configuration beyond the default one.\r\n\r\nThank for your attention. I hope that will be helpful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/7276/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/7276/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2742709809","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12664#issuecomment-2742709809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12664","id":2742709809,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc6jem4x","user":{"login":"ego-thales","id":121242234,"node_id":"U_kgDOBzoCeg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121242234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ego-thales","html_url":"https://github.com/ego-thales","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ego-thales/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ego-thales/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ego-thales/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ego-thales/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ego-thales/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ego-thales/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ego-thales/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ego-thales/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ego-thales/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-21T08:50:22Z","updated_at":"2025-03-21T08:50:22Z","body":"Thanks @hauntsaninja!
