With the change to the line you noted as well as these extra changes, it seems that it fixes the issue (when I run tests by calling `python -m mypy foo.py` in my venv).\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm unable to get the unit tests to pick up a `_typeshed.pyi` file in `test-data/unit/lib-stub` or in `test-data/unit/fixtures` (I had to modify `mypy/test/data.py` to attempt the latter, but it still didn't work). It's been a while since I've worked on mypy, so I may be missing something really simple.
