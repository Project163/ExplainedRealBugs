Returning `list[T]`, for example, could be reasonable.\r\n* If a return type is an instance of `TypeVarType` but the return type is not present as a component in function argument types, generate an error.\r\n* You can use a `TypeTraverserVisitor` to traverse the argument types, and override `visit_type_var` to collect all the references to type variables within a type.

Description\r\n\r\nThis should fix Issue #13061 .\r\n\r\nMypy should now raise an error when it encounters unbound plain TypeVar.\r\nIt should not get triggered when the return type contains a TypeVar (e.g. List[T]).\r\nIt should not get triggered when a same TypeVar is present in the scope (e.g. inner function returns T, and T is an argument of outer function).\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n5 tests were added:\r\n\r\n- a plain unbound typevar triggering the new error\r\n- a typevar inner function not triggering the error\r\n- a function returning an iterable of typevars, not triggering the error\r\n- a plain bound typevar, not triggering the error\r\n- nested bound typevars, not triggering the error\r\n\r\nWe also changed the other functions triggering our error for the tests to pass.\r\n\r\nThis is our 1st contribution to Mypy.

sure if this should be considered a bug, or an enhancement proposal...\r\n\r\nI had some code looking like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCallbackResult = TypeVar(\"CallbackResult\")\r\nVisitCallback =

code:\r\n```\r\nerror: A function returning TypeVar should receive at least one argument containing the same TypeVar  [type-var]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nFirst, I was confused, and thought that mypy is not able to infer that `CallbackResult` is hidden in the function input as the return value of `VisitCallback`. Actually I was initially going to open an issue because of *that*.\r\n\r\nThen I noticed that in a sense, mypy *is* correct - because I spotted that `VisitCallback` returns `Optional[CallbackResult]`, while the `visititems` function returns a `CallbackResult`.\r\n\r\nOnce I fixed that, the error went away. But in this case, mypy did not really \"pinpoint\" the problem as well as I feel it could.\r\n\r\nNot sure how deeply mypy plays out the type algebra to figure out what types are constructible in a context, but I feel like this specific case could be a rather \"common\" one (forgetting the `Optional`), so maybe this can be catched with a better error message.\r\n\r\nMaybe something of the form \"the function returns typevar value X, but based on its inputs can only construct Y[X, ...]\" could be possible? So that it would cover `Optional, Union` and other simple cases like `List`, etc.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used:
