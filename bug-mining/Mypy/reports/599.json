Report**\n\nWhen attempting to add overrides to the `__mul__` and `__rmul__` magic methods, different behaviour is observed for the same set of overrides.\n\nThis seems similar to the issue in #10755, but that has since been fixed.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\nPlayground link: https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.12&gist=1297febcc3b38a2eea422e7073842c31\n\n(Note that this playground is for the latest version (1.14.1), but the same errors are observed on `master`)\n\nSample program:\n\n```py3\nfrom typing import TypeVar, overload\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\nTAmount = TypeVar(\"TAmount\", int, Decimal)\n\n\nclass Unit:\n    @overload\n    def __mul__(self, other: Unit) -> Unit: ...\n    @overload\n    def __mul__(self, other: TAmount) -> Quantity[TAmount]: ...\n\n    def __mul__(self, other: Unit | TAmount) -> Unit | Quantity[TAmount]:\n        raise NotImplementedError\n\n    @overload\n    def __rmul__(self, other: Unit) -> Unit: ...\n    @overload\n    def __rmul__(self, other: TAmount) -> Quantity[TAmount]: ...\n\n    def __rmul__(self, other: Unit | TAmount) -> Unit | Quantity[TAmount]:\n        raise NotImplementedError\n\n\nclass Quantity[TAmount]:\n    def __init__(self, value: TAmount, units: Unit) -> None:\n        self.value = value\n        self.units = units\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nI expect this program to typecheck successfull (or error for both `__mul__` and `__rmul__`)\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\n```\nmain.py:22: error: Signatures of \"__rmul__\" of \"Unit\" and \"__mul__\" of \"Unit | int\" are unsafely overlapping  [misc]\nmain.py:22: error: Signatures of \"__rmul__\" of \"Unit\" and \"__mul__\" of \"Unit | Decimal\" are unsafely overlapping  [misc]\nFound 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18498/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18498/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
