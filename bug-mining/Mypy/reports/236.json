The crash is in two phases:\r\n\r\n1. In the first run, the deamon correctly reports errors: the final message is `Found 238 errors in 46 files (checked 1125 source files)`, then the deamon exits (I don't know if exiting in this situation is the expected behaviour).\r\n2. When I try to restart the deamon the following traceback appears.\r\n\r\nEach time I run the command, these two phases alternate.\r\n\r\n**Traceback**\r\n\r\n```\r\nDaemon crashed!\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"mypy/dmypy_server.py\", line 227, in serve\r\n  File \"mypy/dmypy_server.py\", line 270, in run_command\r\n  File \"mypy/dmypy_server.py\", line 336, in cmd_run\r\n  File \"mypy/dmypy_server.py\", line 405, in check\r\n  File \"mypy/dmypy_server.py\", line 589, in fine_grained_increment_follow_imports\r\n  File \"mypy/server/update.py\", line 277, in update\r\n  File \"mypy/server/update.py\", line 862, in propagate_changes_using_dependencies\r\n  File \"mypy/server/update.py\", line 996, in reprocess_nodes\r\n  File \"mypy/server/astmerge.py\", line 140, in merge_asts\r\n  File \"mypy/server/astmerge.py\", line 192, in replace_nodes_in_ast\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 374, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/server/astmerge.py\", line 213, in visit_mypy_file\r\n  File \"mypy/traverser.py\", line 114, in visit_mypy_file\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 1127, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/server/astmerge.py\", line 238, in visit_class_def\r\n  File \"mypy/server/astmerge.py\", line 393, in process_synthetic_type_info\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 208, in accept\r\nRuntimeError: Not implemented\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I cannot share code for now, I will try to make a reproducible example later.
