Description\r\n\r\nI was planning on adding a ParamSpec-based interface to something I'm making but... it turns out I need `Concatenate` and `Z[[int]]` syntax.\r\n\r\nCloses #11833 \r\nCloses #12276 (needs test)\r\nCloses #12257 (needs test; not sure how to test cache issues)\r\nRefs #8645 \r\nExternal ref https://github.com/python/typeshed/issues/4827\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `Parameters` proper type to represent parameters (more later in this description), along with adding a `Concatenate` operator.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nI copied all (seemingly relevant) tests from PEP 612. I plan on copying test cases from issues and thinking of a few of my own later.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n(not a real section but seemed important enough)\r\n\r\n - `Concatenate` support does *not* use a `ProperType`. That would be too much new code for an operator, in my opinion. Thus, it prepends to a `ParamSpecType`'s `.prefix`.\r\n - I would really *really* like `CallableType` to take in a `parameters: ParamSpecType | Parameters` -- this would simplify some code, and it fits better in your head. However, this would be a breaking change, so I did not do this (along with the fact that making basic changes in this direction led to 300 type errors when self-checking).\r\n~~- `Concatenate` was *super* unspecified by the PEP in my opinion. I ended up making it work wherever `ParamSpec` could be (or so I think)... Which means `Concatenate[int, Concatenate[str, P]]` works!~~\r\n - Error messages could be improved, but I'm not sure where I can get the context to improve those.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11847/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":6,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11847/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"gjoseph92","id":3309802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDk4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3309802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjoseph92","html_url":"https://github.com/gjoseph92","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjoseph92/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjoseph92/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjoseph92/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjoseph92/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjoseph92/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjoseph92/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjoseph92/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjoseph92/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gjoseph92/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-18T19:39:54Z","updated_at":"2022-01-18T19:39:54Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/issues/3219","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/issues/3219/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/issues/3219/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/issues/3219/events","html_url":"https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/pull/3219","id":1105526887,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAISI584xId3X","number":3219,"title":"ParamSpec

is a very large refactoring which aims at making Tutor both more\r\nextendable and more generic. Historically, the Tutor plugin system was\r\ndesigned as an ad-hoc solution to allow developers to modify their own\r\nOpen edX platforms without having to fork Tutor. The plugin API was\r\nsimple, but limited, because of its ad-hoc nature. As a consequence,\r\nthere were many things that plugin developers could not do, such as\r\nextending different parts of the CLI or adding custom template filters.\r\n\r\nHere, we refactor the whole codebase to make use of a generic plugin\r\nsystem. This system was inspired by the Wordpress plugin API and the\r\nOpen edX \"hooks and filters\" API. The various components are added to a\r\nsmall core thanks to a set of actions and filters. Actions are callback\r\nfunctions that can be triggered at different points of the application\r\nlifecycle. Filters are functions that modify some data. Both actions and\r\nfilters are collectively named as \"hooks\". Hooks can optionally be\r\ncreated within a certain context, which makes it easier to keep track of\r\nwhich application created which callback.\r\n\r\nThis new hooks system allows us to provide a Python API that developers\r\ncan use to extend their applications. The API reference is added to the\r\ndocumentation, along with a new plugin development tutorial.\r\n\r\nThe plugin v0 API remains supported for backward compatibility of\r\nexisting plugins.\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n### Is this PR ready for comments?\r\n\r\nYes! If you are a plugin developer, we would like to hear what you have to say.\r\n\r\n### Why is this PR so large?\r\n\r\nBecause I refactored the entire code base to make use of the v1 API. Tutor core now uses its own extension mechanism, in the spirit of [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food). We do that because the eventual long-term goal is to extract the extension API from Tutor in a different package, such that it can be used to deploy not just Open edX, but other software as well. (see [this issue](https://github.com/overhangio/2u-tutor-adoption/issues/10) for more information)\r\n\r\n### Where should I start?\r\n\r\nI'm glad you're interested :)\r\n\r\n1. First, please have a look at the new plugin development tutorial. Basically, read all changes in the docs/ folder.\r\n2. Have a look at the new hooks API, in the tutor/hooks/ folder. \r\n3. Have a look at the changes made in the commands module: all files in the tutor/commands/folder\r\n\r\nI think that at this point you should already have plenty of questions and comments...\r\n\r\n### When should this be merged?\r\n\r\nAll official plugins should be migrated to v1 prior before the Nutmeg release (June 9th 2022), so April 30th would be a good deadline.\r\n\r\n### Will this PR break my plugin?\r\n\r\nNo. Existing plugins should keep working as expected. If they don't, then it's a bug. Please report them in the forum, as usual :)\r\n\r\n### How long will the v0 API be supported? \r\n\r\nA long time. We want to leave time to all developers to migrate their plugins from v0 to v1. I don't anticipate that this will cause any issue, because under the hood the v0 plugin API already uses the v1 API.\r\n\r\n### What can I do with v1 that I couldn't with v0?\r\n\r\nLots of stuff! This PR does not introduce many new features by itself, but I expect that in the future it will become very easy to make profound changes to how Tutor works using just plugins. Here's a sneak peek of what I have in mind:\r\n\r\n- Open edX themes as plugins\r\n- Plugin-extensible argument parsing, for instance to conveniently [automount](https://github.com/overhangio/2u-tutor-adoption/issues/43#issuecomment-1040447164) host folders.\r\n- Extensible `tutor local` and `tutor k8s` CLI.\r\n- Plugin debugging and troubleshooting, via another plugin _naturellement_.\r\n\r\n## Done\r\n\r\n- Do not load commands from plugins which are not enabled.\r\n- Load enabled plugins once on start.\r\n- Implement contexts for actions and filters, which allow us to keep track of\r\n  the source of every hook.\r\n- Migrate patches\r\n- Migrate commands\r\n- Migrate plugin detection\r\n- Migrate templates_root\r\n- Migrate config\r\n- Migrate template environment globals and filters\r\n- Migrate hooks to tasks\r\n- Generate hook documentation\r\n- Generate patch reference documentation\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Amend the API such that we can write `tutor.hooks.Filters.MY_FILTER.apply(...)`\r\n- [x] Maybe rename `Action.on()` to `Action.add()`?\r\n- [x] Make it clearer in the docs that actions and filters are different types of hooks.\r\n- [x] Clarify in the docs that contexts is very much an internal concept that most plugin developers don't have to care about.\r\n- [x] Don't talk about enable/disable in the code, but pick different terms.\r\n- [x] Decide whether to keep action/filter `*args`. EDIT: we should keep them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/overhangio/tutor/issues/599/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/overhangio/tutor/issues/599/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
