On running stubgen for this extension, the generated .pyi file contains: \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom typing import Any, ClassVar\r\n\r\nclass Custom:\r\n    // This is wrong. Var{1,2,3} are not Class Variables but are rather instance variables.\r\n    var1: ClassVar[getset_descriptor] = ...\r\n    var2: ClassVar[getset_descriptor] = ...\r\n    var3: ClassVar[member_descriptor] = ...   \r\n    // This is wrong. \r\n\r\n    def display(self, *args, **kwargs) -> Any: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Detailed Reproducer:**\r\n 1. In some test directory (say $DIR), download the attached file _extension.zip_ to extension folder.\r\n 3. Compile the extension by running: `g++ -fPIC -std=c++11 -I. -I/opt/python/python-3.9/include/python3.9 -Iextension -c extension/extension.C -o extension.o` in directory $DIR.\r\n 4. Create the .so file by running: `g++ -shared  -L/opt/python/python-3.9/lib64 -Wl,-R/opt/python/python-3.9/lib64 extension.o -o extension.so` in directory $DIR.\r\n 5. Run stubgen using `env PYTHONPATH=$DIR stubgen -m extension`\r\n 6. Notice that the generated $DIR/out/extension.pyi declares var{1,2,3} as 'Class Variables' which is wrong.\r\n\r\nOn digging into this, I found this is due to a wrong check in `stubgenc.py#is_c_property`.\r\n```\r\ndef is_c_property(obj: object) -> bool:\r\n    return inspect.isdatadescriptor(obj) and hasattr(obj, 'fget')\r\n```\r\nThe check should contain \"or\" (instead of \"and\") since the instance variables in case of C extension doesn't have the \"fget\" attribute but `inspect.isdatadescription` return True.\r\nOn making this change locally, stubgen runs fine. \r\n\r\nIf this looks good to you, I can raise a PR for the same.\r\n\r\n[extension.zip](https://github.com/python/mypy/files/8023192/extension.zip)","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12150/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12150/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
