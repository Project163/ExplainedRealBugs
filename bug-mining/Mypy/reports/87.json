Report**\r\n\r\nI bisected this, the regression was introduced in https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/11352 CC @BarnabyShearer @sobolevn \r\n\r\nhere's a minimal case split out from `pre-commit`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport concurrent.futures\r\nimport contextlib\r\nfrom typing import Callable\r\nfrom typing import Generator\r\nfrom typing import Iterable\r\nfrom typing import TypeVar\r\n\r\nTArg = TypeVar('TArg')\r\nTRet = TypeVar('TRet')\r\n\r\n@contextlib.contextmanager\r\ndef _thread_mapper(maxsize: int) -> Generator[\r\n    Callable[[Callable[[TArg], TRet], Iterable[TArg]], Iterable[TRet]],\r\n    None, None,\r\n]:\r\n    if maxsize == 1:\r\n        yield map\r\n    else:\r\n        with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(maxsize) as ex:\r\n            yield ex.map\r\n\r\n\r\ndef double(x: int) -> int: return x * 2\r\n\r\nwith _thread_mapper(1) as m:\r\n    print(list(m(double, [2, 3])))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. `mypy t.py`\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nI expect it to pass (as it did with 0.920)\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ mypy ../t.py\r\n../t.py:25: error: Need type annotation for \"m\"\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 0.930 (regression from 0.920)\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: none\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): none\r\n- Python version used: 3.8.10\r\n- Operating system and version: ubuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nYou can freely edit this text,
