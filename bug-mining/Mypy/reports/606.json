E.g. It would be reasonable to expect that IntEnum subclasses have their raw values as ints. Instead, mypy detects it as a literal of whatever it sees. This is especially a problem for `*.pyi` stubs, where options are assigned ellipsis.\n\nIn addition, [Python documentation](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/enums.html#defining-members) allows specifying special `_value_` attribute, that type-checkers should use to infer the raw value type. E.g. they even have a snippet:\n\n```python\nclass ColumnType(Enum):\n    _value_: int\n    DORIC = ...\n    IONIC = ...\n    CORINTHIAN = ...\n\nreveal_type(ColumnType.DORIC.value)  # Revealed type is int (or object or Any)\n```\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n```python\nimport enum\nimport typing\n\nclass Simple(enum.IntEnum):\n    OPTION = ...\n\nclass WithValue(enum.IntEnum):\n    _value_: int\n    OPTION = ...\n\nclass WithDirectValue(enum.IntEnum):\n    _value_: int\n    OPTION = 2\n\nclass NonInt(enum.Enum):\n    _value_: str\n    OPTION = \"str\"\n\ntyping.reveal_type(Simple.OPTION)\ntyping.reveal_type(Simple.OPTION.value)\ntyping.reveal_type(WithValue.OPTION)\ntyping.reveal_type(WithValue.OPTION.value)\ntyping.reveal_type(WithDirectValue.OPTION)\ntyping.reveal_type(WithDirectValue.OPTION.value)\ntyping.reveal_type(NonInt.OPTION)\ntyping.reveal_type(NonInt.OPTION.value)\n```\n\nGIST: https://gist.github.com/mypy-play/18540009e25f31525cd1b872ca2a252c\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nThe output is:\n\n```text\nnote: Revealed type is \"Literal[Simple.OPTION]?\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"int\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"Literal[WithValue.OPTION]?\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"int\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"Literal[WithDirectValue.OPTION]?\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"int\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"Literal[NonInt.OPTION]?\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"str\"\n```\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\nThe output is:\n\n```text\nnote: Revealed type is \"Literal[Simple.OPTION]?\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"types.EllipsisType\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"Literal[WithValue.OPTION]?\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"types.EllipsisType\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"Literal[WithDirectValue.OPTION]?\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"Literal[2]?\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"Literal[NonInt.OPTION]?\"\nnote: Revealed type is \"Literal['str']?\"\n```\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\n\n- Mypy version used: 1.16.1\n- Mypy command-line flags: mypy file.py\n- Python version used: 3.11.11 (but Gist is also at Python 3.12)\n","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19334/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19334/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
