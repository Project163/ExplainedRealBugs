variable appears in un-annotated function (with an error code to opt-out)\r\n* [x] Safe handling of empty bodies (with a flag to opt-out, + new error codes) @ilevkivskyi \r\n* [x] Split `--enable-incomplete-features`\r\n* [ ] Implement as much of `Unpack` and `TypeVarTuple` as possible @jhance \r\n* [x] Enable recursive types by default @ilevkivskyi \r\n* [x] Make `implicit_optional` off by default (with a code transform tool to fix existing annotations) @hauntsaninja \r\n* [x] Detect unbound variables @ilinum \r\n* [ ] Use unions for ternary joins @JelleZijlstra \r\n* [x] Full support for non-typing 3.11 features, see https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12840\r\n* [x] Support as many typing 3.11 features as we can (including `Enum`)\r\n* [x] Make `--namespace-packages` the default @hauntsaninja \r\n* [ ] Allow/disallow PEP 561 packages @ethanhs \r\n\r\nLess important things:\r\n* [ ] Support default value of generic parameter\r\n* [ ] Always narrow types (see #2008)\r\n* [ ] Fix lost narrowing in inner functions\r\n* [ ] Make `--local-partial-types` enabled by default (if fallout is not bad)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13685/reactions","total_count":35,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":17,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":18,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13685/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"amotl","id":453543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzU0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/453543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amotl","html_url":"https://github.com/amotl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amotl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amotl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amotl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amotl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amotl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amotl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amotl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amotl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amotl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-01T22:13:29Z","updated_at":"2023-10-01T22:13:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/frictionlessdata/frictionless-py/issues/1593","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/frictionlessdata/frictionless-py","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/frictionlessdata/frictionless-py/issues/1593/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/frictionlessdata/frictionless-py/issues/1593/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/frictionlessdata/frictionless-py/issues/1593/events","html_url":"https://github.com/frictionlessdata/frictionless-py/issues/1593","id":1920998559,"node_id":"I_kwDOAbGAMc5ygByf","number":1593,"title":"mypy:
