planning to release mypy 0.900 some time in March. This release will have a particularly significant change, as third-party stubs are no longer shipped with mypy. They need to be installed by installing suitable stub packages. For example, `pip install types-requests` installs the stubs for Requests. Mypy will suggest the names of stub packages to install, and `mypy --install-types` will automatically install the suggested stub packages (this doesn't work with the mypy daemon, however).\r\n\r\nSince this change is potentially quite disruptive, I'm announcing the release here well ahead of the target release date.\r\n\r\nThe unbundling of typeshed is already implemented in GitHub master, so it's possible to start testing this right now.

goal of this change is to make it so that the retirement transaction for a node is at most followed by a single signature from that node (if it is primary), but no more. This is to facilitate audit, it isn't a security change, since the primary is still ordering transactions of course.\r\n\r\nIn practice, it means expanding the consensus state machine somewhat, with two new states:\r\n\r\nRetiring 1: entered when `retirement_idx` is set to the index of the retirement transaction\r\nRetiring 2: entered when `retirement_committable_idx` is set to the index of the first signature following `retirement_idx`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the following transitions are possible:\r\n\r\nRetiring 1 -> Follower, on `rollback()`\r\nRetiring 2 -> Follower, on `rollback()`\r\nRetiring 2 -> Retired, on `commit_idx` moving past `retirement_committable_idx`\r\n\r\nNote that Retiring 2 -> Retiring 1 is never possible, since a rollback that removes `retirement_committable_idx` necessarily removes `retirement_idx` as well.\r\n\r\nIn terms of behaviour, Retiring 1 doesn't affect a Leader or Follower. When entering Retiring 2 however, Leaders will stop replicating anything higher than `retirement_committable_idx`, and followers will similarly reject append entries higher than `retirement_committable_idx`.\r\n\r\nWhen transitioning to `Retired`, Leaders will also stop sending heartbeats.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4016369/121199113-92357e80-c86a-11eb-90a5-6793d01271c1.png)\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] Document state machine\r\n- [x] Rename `become_follower()`\r\n- [x] Add `can_replicate()` and have frontend use that rather than `is_primary()` to decide if it can handle write transactions.\r\n- [x] Add audit test to check number of
