See the example below.\n\nIf the function has no paramters, the error is \"Method must have at least one argument.\". Again, it does not matter what the decorator does to the function.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n```python\nimport typing\n\ndef apply_on_answer[T](f: typing.Callable[[int], T], /) -> T:\n    return f(42)\n\nclass C:\n    @apply_on_answer\n    def x(answer: int) -> int:\n        return answer\n\nassert type(C.x) is int\nassert C.x == 42\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\nmypy should emit no errors.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\nmypy emits the following error:\n```\na.py:8: error: Self argument missing for a non-static method (or an invalid type for self)  [misc]\n```\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n- Mypy version used: cb3bddd41149405e2dfaa615cfc4c6f109eb80f3\n- Mypy command-line flags: `--strict`\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): ``\n- Python version used: 3.13.5\n","closed_by":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
