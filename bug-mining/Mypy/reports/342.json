However, there's two issues affecting maintainability:\r\n- The error codes span 2 pages\r\n- The anchors are autogenerated from titles\r\n\r\nWhich leads to having to keep a map of all code-to-url, like this:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/vscode-mypy/pull/58/files#diff-3c2e579f59d8e749f5527d64f087396907db30414fe139bc91a1ecce9f9613ddR22\r\n\r\nI would prefer if it was possible to programmatically link to mypy error codes documentation with only the information given by the mypy/dmypy CLI. Redirection is an acceptable solution to me.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15431/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15431/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
