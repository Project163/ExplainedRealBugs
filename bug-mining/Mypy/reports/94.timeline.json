Although it works fine during runtime.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom enum import Enum\r\n\r\n\r\nclass BaseEnum(Enum):\r\n    __something__ = 3\r\n\r\n\r\nclass SomeEnum(BaseEnum):\r\n    __something__ = 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nIt should typecheck, as it passes during runtime.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: Cannot override final attribute \"__something__\" (previously declared in base class \"BaseEnum\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: `master`
