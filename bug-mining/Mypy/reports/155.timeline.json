This change seems to solve this crash, but I'm not 100% it's not treating a symptom and not the cause - the inferred type of `var_a` seems to depend on the presence of the other `property` in the class, and a type hint in the parent's constructor, where it seems like it shouldn't.\r\n\r\nIf I remove all the `var_b` property stuff, then the crash goes away and `mypy` reports the errors I expected to see, but to me, the type of `var_b` shouldn't have any impact on the type of `var_a`.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to make a PR, but in this case I don't think I understand the underlying cause myself yet - if your solution is correct, I don't fully understand _why_ - so I'd rather wait on that.

The reproducer here can be done in several different ways, but this is probably the purest, most minimal example, touching the least number of different components:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Base:\r\n    def __init__(self, arg: int):\r\n        self.partial_type = []\r\n        self.force_deferral = []\r\n\r\n    force_deferral = []\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Derived(Base):\r\n    def partial_type(self) -> int:\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `Base.__init__` block will be deferred because of the multiple definitions of `force_deferral`, which leaves `Base.partial_type` inferred as `<partial list[?]>` after the first pass (the `arg: int` just forces us to use complete type checking within the `__init__`).  Analysis of `Derived.partial_type` then needs to check if the types `def () -> int` and `<partial list[?]>` are compatible, which fails with the \"cannot check a partial type with issubtype\" error in the main post.\r\n\r\nI think the correct solution to this is what's given above in https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11686#issuecomment-989115227, since I now understand why the seemingly unrelated `force_deferral` was affecting whether the crash appeared.
