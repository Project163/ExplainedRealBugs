One example pair is [`google-cloud-storage`](https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-storage/) and [`protobuf`](https://pypi.org/project/protobuf/). If you pip install both of these packages, you can see that they both get installed under a top level `google/` folder:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from google.cloud import storage\r\n>>> from google.protobuf import message\r\n>>> storage.__file__\r\n'.../python3.9/site-packages/google/cloud/storage/__init__.py'\r\n>>> message.__file__\r\n'.../python3.9/site-packages/google/protobuf/message.py'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a problem when one of the packages has a hit in typeshed, but the other does not. In this case, there is a `types-protobuf` package, but not a `types-google-cloud-storage` package. Running `mypy` will _always_ error, even when `--ignore-missing-imports` is set. I believe this happens because it _thinks_ that a known library stub is missing (probably because of the shared `google` namespace), but this is not the case.\r\n\r\nFurther, the error message Hints at an incorrect solution:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnote: Hint: \"python3 -m pip install types-protobuf\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis message shows up even when `types-protobuf` is already installed.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nCreate two files, `requirements.txt` and `repro.py`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# requirements.txt\r\nprotobuf\r\ngoogle-cloud-storage\r\ntypes-protobuf\r\nmypy\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# repro.py\r\nfrom google.cloud import storage\r\nfrom google.protobuf import message\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall the packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\r\n\r\nRun `mypy`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mypy .\r\nrepro.py:1: error: Library stubs not installed for \"google.cloud\" (or incompatible with Python 3.9)\r\nrepro.py:1: note: Hint: \"python3 -m pip install types-protobuf\"\r\nrepro.py:1: note: (or run \"mypy --install-types\" to install all missing stub packages)\r\nrepro.py:1: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#missing-imports\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately, `--ignore-missing-imports` does not get rid of the error.\r\n```\r\n$ mypy . --ignore-missing-imports\r\nrepro.py:1: error: Library stubs not installed for \"google.cloud\" (or incompatible with Python 3.9)\r\nrepro.py:1: note: Hint: \"python3 -m pip install types-protobuf\"\r\nrepro.py:1: note: (or run \"mypy --install-types\" to install all missing stub packages)\r\nrepro.py:1: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#missing-imports\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI may be missing something, but as far as I can tell there is no way to force this error to go away. Since it _always_ errors out, this makes it very hard to typecheck my code, especially in an automated CICD pipeline.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the hint is not helpful, as it suggests installing a package that is already installed!\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python3 -m pip install types-protobuf\r\nRequirement already satisfied: types-protobuf in .../python3.9/site-packages (0.1.10)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: types-futures in .../python3.9/site-packages (from types-protobuf) (0.1.3)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\n* I would expect `--ignore-missing-imports` to get rid of this error.\r\n* The suggested hint is wrong, and I would expect it to not be shown.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n* No way to get rid of this \"error\".\r\n* Incorrect Hint is shown.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 0.900.\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: see above\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): n/a\r\n- Python version used: 3.9.1\r\n- Operating system and version: macos","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10601/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10601/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
