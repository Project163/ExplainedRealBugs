Here's a few things anyone can do:\r\n- Identify any other clusters of similar issues that we can label together.\r\n- Feel free to ping me on any issue to suggest applying labels or closing the issue.\r\n- Old issues that are no longer relevant or that are better proposed on the python/typing tracker can be closed.\r\n- I'd support giving out triage permissions easily to anyone with some record of useful work on this tracker or other typing-related projects. Let me know if you're interested, but note that this isn't a decision I can make by myself.\r\n\r\nHere are some notes on specific labels:\r\n- https://github.com/python/mypy/labels/bug, https://github.com/python/mypy/labels/false-positive, https://github.com/python/mypy/labels/feature – the distinction between these isn't always very clear. Not sure how useful they are.\r\n- https://github.com/python/mypy/labels/crash – Not good that we have 76 open crash bugs! We should review them to see if they are still valid and if so, how hard they are to fix.\r\n- https://github.com/python/mypy/labels/new-semantic-analyzer – Was \"new\" a few years ago. Not sure this label is still useful.\r\n- https://github.com/python/mypy/labels/priority-0-high – High priority doesn't mean much with 110 open issues. Maybe we need a new way to track priority.\r\n- https://github.com/python/mypy/labels/topic-join-v-union – This is a great example of finding a useful pattern in the issue tracker (thanks @erictraut). Finding other similar patterns should give us more high-impact bugs to fix.\r\n- https://github.com/python/mypy/labels/topic-type-narrowing – It's very common to see bugs of the form \"mypy doesn't narrow types when I do `if <something complicated>`\". Probably a lot of them are duplicates or should be closed as not realistically fixable.\r\n- https://github.com/python/mypy/labels/topic-type-variables – I feel like most nontrivial type checking bugs involve type variables. We should look for something more precise to classify these.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12384/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12384/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6590324252,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5AUeXszwAAAAGI0F4c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6590324252","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4adadcb75aca69d05cb7e2c7cc872b5634dd6d4b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/4adadcb75aca69d05cb7e2c7cc872b5634dd6d4b","created_at":"2022-05-11T13:19:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-11T13:19:30Z","updated_at":"2022-05-11T13:19:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12767","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12767/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12767/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12767/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/12767","id":1232630277,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGuhRc43pqu0","number":12767,"title":"Fix
