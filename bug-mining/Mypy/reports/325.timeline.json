#12977\r\n\r\nIMO current dict expression inference logic is quite arbitrary: we only take the non-star items to infer resulting type, then enforce it on the remaining (star) items. In this PR I simplify the logic to simply put all expressions as arguments into the same call. This has following benefits:\r\n* Makes everything more consistent/predictable.\r\n* Fixes one of top upvoted bugs\r\n* Makes dict item indexes correct (previously we reshuffled them causing wrong indexes for non-star items after star items)\r\n* No more weird wordings like `List item <n>` or `Argument <n> to \"update\" of \"dict\"`\r\n* I also fix the end position of generated expressions to show correct spans in errors\r\n\r\nThe only downside is that we will see `Cannot infer type argument` error instead of `Incompatible type` more often. This is because `SupportsKeysAndGetItem` (used for star items) is invariant in key type. I think this is fine however, since:\r\n* This only affects key types, that are mixed much less often than value types (they are usually just strings), and for latter we use joins.\r\n* I added a dedicated note for this case","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9174083902,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5Lp70KzwAAAAIi0Wk-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/9174083902","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-05T07:16:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9174084230,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5Lp70KzwAAAAIi0WqG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/9174084230","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"541639e474085f18ed61527d97ba4620e4334e09","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/541639e474085f18ed61527d97ba4620e4334e09","created_at":"2023-05-05T07:16:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
