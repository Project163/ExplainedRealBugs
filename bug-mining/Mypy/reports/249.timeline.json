Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThe `ClientSession` class allows you to specify a `response_class` which is then used for responses in place of `ClientResponse` when handling responses. However the typings are not generic, they are hard coded to use `ClientResponse` so custom aspects of the `response_class` result in type errors.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Add a custom `response_class`\r\n2. Use a request method on a `ClientSession`, e.g. `client.post()`\r\n3. The `response_class` in 1 will be used, but it will still be typed as the default `ClientResponse`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nUse the `response_class` type in typings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\n\r\n```console\r\npython=3.10.8\r\naiohttp=3.8.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code of Conduct\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow the aio-libs Code of Conduct","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/7109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/7109/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
