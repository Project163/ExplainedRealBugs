This is a strange failure of inference.\r\n\r\nThe following snippet demonstrates the weird inconsistency:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\ndef foo(x: list[list[int]]) -> list[int] | None:\r\n    reveal_type(min(x, key=len, default=None))  # N: Revealed type is \"Union[builtins.list[builtins.int], None]\"\r\n    return min(x, key=len, default=None)  # E: Argument \"key\" to \"min\" has incompatible type \"Callable[[Sized], int]\"; expected \"Callable[[list[int] | None], SupportsDunderLT[Any] | SupportsDunderGT[Any]]\"  [arg-type]\r\n\r\nfoos: list[list[int]]\r\nreveal_type(min(foos, key=len, default=None))  # N: Revealed type is \"Union[builtins.list[builtins.int], None]\"\r\nmin_foo: list[int] | None = min(foos, key=len, default=None)  # E: Argument \"key\" to \"min\" has incompatible type \"Callable[[Sized], int]\"; expected \"Callable[[list[int] | None], SupportsDunderLT[Any] | SupportsDunderGT[Any]]\"  [arg-type]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `return` line produces an `arg-type` error, but the same expression (!) on the previous line has type assignable to return type. The same happens outside of the function with and without output types.\r\n\r\n`min` is defined in typeshed as \r\n\r\n```python\r\n@overload\r\ndef min(\r\n    arg1: SupportsRichComparisonT, arg2: SupportsRichComparisonT, /, *_args: SupportsRichComparisonT, key: None = None\r\n) -> SupportsRichComparisonT: ...\r\n@overload\r\ndef min(arg1: _T, arg2: _T, /, *_args: _T, key: Callable[[_T],
