This is not easy to fix, since plugin for `update()` returns a TypedDict with no required keys. So even though this particular case will be fixed if we tweak equality for TypedDicts by ignoring fallback, it is easy to construct an example, that will still fail with the same errors.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1399072731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"ilinum","id":5924452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjQ0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5924452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum","html_url":"https://github.com/ilinum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-21T02:18:50Z","updated_at":"2023-01-21T02:18:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13685","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13685/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13685/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13685/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13685","id":1377755941,"node_id":"I_kwDOAGuhRc5SHuMl","number":13685,"title":"Release

variable appears in un-annotated function (with an error code to opt-out)\r\n* [x] Safe handling of empty bodies (with a flag to opt-out, + new error codes) @ilevkivskyi \r\n* [x] Split `--enable-incomplete-features`\r\n* [ ] Implement as much of `Unpack` and `TypeVarTuple` as possible @jhance \r\n* [x] Enable recursive types by default @ilevkivskyi \r\n* [x] Make `implicit_optional` off by default (with a code transform tool to fix existing annotations) @hauntsaninja \r\n* [x] Detect unbound variables @ilinum \r\n* [ ] Use unions for ternary joins @JelleZijlstra \r\n* [x] Full support for non-typing 3.11 features, see https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12840\r\n* [x] Support as many typing 3.11 features as we can (including `Enum`)\r\n* [x] Make `--namespace-packages` the default @hauntsaninja \r\n* [ ] Allow/disallow PEP 561 packages @ethanhs \r\n\r\nLess important things:\r\n* [ ] Support default value of generic parameter\r\n* [ ] Always narrow types (see #2008)\r\n* [ ] Fix lost narrowing in inner functions\r\n* [ ] Make `--local-partial-types` enabled by default (if fallout is not
