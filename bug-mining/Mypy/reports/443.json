But it was rather frustrating.\r\n\r\nIt is usually possible to show the same change log document in Sphinx. The challenge here is that it's in Markdown and Sphinx isn't set up to stomach it.\r\n\r\nThe solution is integrating `MyST-parser` by adding it to https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/fe15ee6/docs/requirements-docs.txt and https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/fe15ee6/docs/source/conf.py#L38, followed by creating a `changelog.md` inside https://github.com/python/mypy/tree/fe15ee6/docs/source/ containing something like https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/index.html#include-a-file-from-outside-the-docs-folder-like-readme-md. Though, it can be `changelog.rst` too (https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq/index.html#include-markdown-files-into-an-rst-file).\r\nFinally, a `changelog` entry needs to be added to ToC around https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/fe15ee6/docs/source/index.rst?plain=1#L99C4-L105C7.\r\n\r\nP.S. While writing this, I realized that https://mypy-lang.org does not have a change log link either. I don't know where its source is but it'd be nice to link the Sphinx-exposed change log page from that too.","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17717/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
