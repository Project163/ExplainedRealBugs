there's one gotcha to keep in mind when you implement this. In general, enum types can be expanded into their individual literal member types. For example, the type `ValueType` is equivalent to `Literal[ValueType.BOOLEAN, ValueType.DATE, ValueType.DATETIME]` in the code sample above. This equivalency allows you to eliminate subtypes from the literal union based on pattern matches. However, this expansion doesn't work for classes that derive from `enum.Flag`, so this needs to be special-cased. For more details, refer to [this section of the typing spec](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/enums.html#enum-literal-expansion).

ActionsGetter.get_actions\n\n\nprint(Child().get_actions(\"one\"))\n```\n\nThis works at runtime but at static time it complains with\n\n```\na.py:20: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"Callable[[], Iterable[str]]\", base class \"Parent\" defined the type as \"GetActions\")  [assignment]\na.py:20: note: \"GetActions.__call__\" has type \"Callable[[Arg(str,
