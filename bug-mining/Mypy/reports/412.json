The reason I want to do this is I am adding a new enum that will grow over time, and want to make sure that when new values are added to the enum, they get handled by downstream code.\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport enum\r\nfrom typing_extensions import assert_never\r\n\r\nclass MyEnum(enum.Enum):\r\n    foo = \"foo\"\r\n\r\ndef foo(x: MyEnum) -> int:\r\n    match x:\r\n        case MyEnum.foo:\r\n            return 1\r\n\r\n    assert_never(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nI expect this to typecheck with no errors\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n```\r\nmypy test.py\r\ntest.py:14: error: Argument 1 to \"assert_never\" has incompatible type \"MyEnum\"; expected \"NoReturn\"  [arg-type]\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that changing the original to the following results in a clean run, so the issue here seems to be that the enum only has one member.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport enum\r\nfrom typing_extensions import assert_never\r\n\r\nclass MyEnum(enum.Enum):\r\n    foo = \"foo\"\r\n    bar = \"bar\"\r\n\r\ndef foo(x: MyEnum) -> int:\r\n    match x:\r\n        case MyEnum.foo:\r\n            return 1\r\n        case MyEnum.bar:\r\n            return 2\r\n\r\n    assert_never(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: mypy 0.991 (compiled: yes) \r\n- Mypy command-line flags: N/A\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): N/A\r\n- Python version used: 3.10.4\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14109/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14109/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
