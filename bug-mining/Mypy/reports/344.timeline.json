#14056\r\n\r\n#14056 was originally reported as a mypyc issue (because that's how it presented itself to the user), but the underlying bug is really a bug to do with how mypy understands metaclasses. On mypy `master`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass Meta(type):\r\n    bar: str\r\n\r\nclass Foo(metaclass=Meta):\r\n    bar: int\r\n\r\nreveal_type(Foo().bar)  # Revealed type is int (correct!)\r\nreveal_type(Foo.bar)  # Revealed type is int, but should be str\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that incorrect behaviour.\r\n\r\nSince this is really a mypy bug rather than a mypyc bug, I haven't added a mypyc test, but I'm happy to if that would be useful. (I'll need some guidance as to exactly where it should go -- I don't know much about mypyc internals!)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9555645128,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5WAXMHzwAAAAI5j5LI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/9555645128","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-16T20:24:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9555645735,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5WAXMHzwAAAAI5j5Un","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/9555645735","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"21cc1c74b7b531ef6e1024d35b364fe30077117b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/21cc1c74b7b531ef6e1024d35b364fe30077117b","created_at":"2023-06-16T20:24:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
