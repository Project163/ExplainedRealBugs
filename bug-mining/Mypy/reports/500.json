It's type-unsafe, even in the most explicit of situations: `def tohex(x: CanHex): return x.hex()` \r\n2. This issue, in combination with https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/18257, makes it impossible to distinguish between `int` and `float` input using static typing. \r\n\r\nThe second reason in particular is a big problem for NumPy, because it forces us to annotate e.g. `np.dtype(complex)` as `np.dtype[np.complex128 | np.float64 | np.int_ | np.bool]`, and `np.array(3.14)` as `np.ndarray[tuple[()], np.dtype[np.float64 | np.int_ | np.bool]]`. \r\nSo I'm sure you can see how this is confusing for users, especially if you consider that usually tends to propagate to other dtype- and array-types.\r\n\r\nWe can't use the \"`Any` trick\" either, because that'd be problematic for functions that overload on dtype, of which there are many.","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
