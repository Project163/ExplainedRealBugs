Report**\r\n\r\nFor context, I'm lightly abusing Mypy's model of the world to pass `Protocol` objects around at runtime; hopefully by the time things are fixed so that `Protocol`s no longer look instantiatable we'll also have #9773 or something to allow for more runtime dynamism using them ;)\r\n\r\nHowever, the bug in question actually shows up with function objects as well, albeit with a slightly different way.\r\n\r\nConsider the following program:\r\n\r\n```python3\r\nfrom typing import Protocol, TypeVar, Generic, Callable, ParamSpec\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\r\n\r\nTco = TypeVar(\"Tco\", covariant=True)\r\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\r\nT2 = TypeVar(\"T2\")\r\nP = ParamSpec(\"P\")\r\n\r\nclass NamedCallable(Protocol[Tco]):\r\n    __name__: str\r\n    def __call__(self) -> Tco:\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass G(Generic[T, T2, P]):\r\n    x: NamedCallable[T]\r\n    y: Callable[P, T2]\r\n\r\n\r\nclass SomeProtocol(Protocol):\r\n    def method(self) -> None:\r\n        ...\r\n\r\ndef f(x: str) -> int:\r\n    ...\r\n\r\ndef actual_function() -> SomeProtocol:\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nreveal_type(f)\r\nreveal_type(actual_function)\r\nreveal_type(SomeProtocol)\r\ng = G(SomeProtocol, f)\r\ng2 = G(actual_function, f)\r\nreveal_type(g)\r\nreveal_type(g2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfkljsadf.py:31: note: Revealed type is \"def (x: builtins.str) -> builtins.int\"\r\nfkljsadf.py:32: note: Revealed type is \"def () -> fkljsadf.SomeProtocol\"\r\nfkljsadf.py:33: note: Revealed type is \"def () -> fkljsadf.SomeProtocol\"\r\nfkljsadf.py:35: error: Need type annotation for \"g2\"\r\nfkljsadf.py:35: error: Argument 1 to \"G\" has incompatible type \"Callable[[], SomeProtocol]\"; expected \"NamedCallable[<nothing>]\"\r\nfkljsadf.py:36: note: Revealed type is \"fkljsadf.G[Any, builtins.int, [x: builtins.str]]\"\r\nfkljsadf.py:37: note: Revealed type is \"fkljsadf.G[Any, builtins.int, [x: builtins.str]]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I comment out the `__name__` attribute of `NamedCallable`, the errors go away and I instead get this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfkljsadf.py:31: note: Revealed type is \"def (x: builtins.str) -> builtins.int\"\r\nfkljsadf.py:32: note: Revealed type is \"def () -> fkljsadf.SomeProtocol\"\r\nfkljsadf.py:33: note: Revealed type is \"def () -> fkljsadf.SomeProtocol\"\r\nfkljsadf.py:36: note: Revealed type is \"fkljsadf.G[fkljsadf.SomeProtocol, builtins.int, [x: builtins.str]]\"\r\nfkljsadf.py:37: note: Revealed type is \"fkljsadf.G[fkljsadf.SomeProtocol, builtins.int, [x: builtins.str]]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that the revealed type is `def () -> SomeProtocol` for both the protocol object itself and the function, I am surprised that `g` silently degrades to `Any` but `g2` requests an explicit annotation.  It is also odd that the `__name__` attribute, which *is* present on both of these objects at runtime, seems to be an impediment here.\r\n\r\nSo there area a few bugs here:\r\n\r\n- if `actual_function` and `SomeProtocol` are in fact different objects internally to Mypy (one thinking it has a `__name__` and the other doesn't) perhaps the string they show in `reveal_type` ought to be visibly distinct?\r\n- these objects do have `__name__` attributes and it seems like they ought to be inferred\r\n- why falling back to `Any` here with no warning in the `Protocol` case?\r\n- `Protocol`s aren't actually functions that return themselves (but please don't fix this one yet unless we have some other way to pass these around 😉).\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: mypy 0.961 (compiled: yes)\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: none\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): none\r\n- Python version used: Python 3.10.4 (python.org)\r\n- Operating system and version:\r\n```\r\nProductName:\tmacOS\r\nProductVersion:\t12.4\r\nBuildVersion:\t21F79\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nYou can freely edit this text, please remove all the lines\r\nyou believe are unnecessary.\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12976/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1317033548","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10482#issuecomment-1317033548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10482","id":1317033548,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5OgFZM","user":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-16T13:35:17Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T13:35:17Z","body":"Hm, this is because in typeshed `type.__call__` is annotated as returning `(*Any, **Any) -> Any`, making all class objects implementing arbitrary callback protocols.

tracker is better suited\r\nfor this report: https://github.com/python/typeshed/issues\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom typing import Protocol\r\n\r\nclass A():\r\n  def __init__(self, x: int) -> None:\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nclass B(Protocol):\r\n  def __call__(self) -> None:\r\n    pass\r\n\r\ndef run(obj: B) -> None:\r\n  obj()\r\n\r\ndef main() -> None:\r\n  x = A\r\n  run(x)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n  main()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `main` function, a class `A` (literally class, not an object of this class) is passed to the `run` function which expects an object implementing the protocol `B`. However, the protocol `B` requires the object to be callable without any arguments, but the constructor of `A` expects one integer. `mypy` does not report any error.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Save the code snippet above into a file `program.py`.\r\n2. Execute `python program.py` to verify that there is indeed an argument mismatch.\r\n    ```\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File \"program.py\", line 19, in <module>\r\n        main()\r\n      File \"program.py\", line 16, in main\r\n        run(x)\r\n      File \"program.py\", line 12, in run\r\n        obj()\r\n    TypeError: __init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'x'\r\n    ```\r\n3. Execute `mypy program.py` to verify that `mypy` does not report any errors.\r\n    ```\r\n    Success: no issues found in 1 source file\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect your project to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Write down what you thought would happen.
