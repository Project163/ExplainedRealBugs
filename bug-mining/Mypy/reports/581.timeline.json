#18901. \n\nSide question: why don't we support boolean literals there (as in `if True or sys.platform == \"linux\"`)? Is it an escape hatch to make mypy check some {platform,version}-dependent code on all {platform,version}s?\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n- **Bug Fixes**\n\t- Improved handling of logical negation and binary logical expressions in condition evaluation, resulting in more accurate detection of unreachable code.\n\n- **Tests**\n\t- Added test cases for conditional expressions involving platform checks, logical operators, and negations to verify correct unreachable code detection and type inference.\n<!-- end of
