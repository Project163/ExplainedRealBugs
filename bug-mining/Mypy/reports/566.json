In a class definition, I use this constant to swap out implementations of a method. While inside a type guarding block, but outside the method definition, the type of the `Final` object is narrowed, but inside of the method it is not narrowed.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\nhttps://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.12&gist=2d4c97cffea1dd6710bf5cc7283f7290\n\n```python\nfrom typing import *\n\ndef _init() -> None | str:\n    return None\n\nRESOLVE_X: Final = _init()\n\nclass Example:\n    \n    if RESOLVE_X is not None:\n        \n        reveal_type(RESOLVE_X)  # note: Revealed type is \"builtins.str\"\n        \n        def __str__(self) -> str:\n            return RESOLVE_X  # error: Incompatible return value type (got \"str | None\", expected \"str\")  [return-value]\n            \n    else:\n        def __str__(self) -> str:\n            return \"example\"\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nInside the `__str__` definition in the `if RESOLVE_X is not None:` block, RESOLVE_X should stay narrowed as it cannot be reassigned and have its type re-widened in the future.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\n```\nmain.py:12: note: Revealed type is \"builtins.str\"\nmain.py:15: error: Incompatible return value type (got \"str | None\", expected \"str\")  [return-value]\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n```\n\n**Your Environment**\n\nMypy version 1.15.0.\nPython 3.12.\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19080/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
