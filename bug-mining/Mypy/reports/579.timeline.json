Report**\r\n\r\nIn `dataclasses`, attributes without a default cannot follow attributes with one unless they are keyword-only arguments. By setting the parameter `kw_only=True` of the `dataclass` decorator, all fields of the class are marked as keyword-only. By setting the parameter `kw_only=True` of the `field` function, the annotated attribute is marked as keyword-only. The problem occurs when an argument with a default is marked as keyword-only by using the `field` function but not the `dataclass` decorator, and is followed by another argument without a default. `mypy` reports an error, but it shouldn't.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# example.py\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\r\n\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass User:\r\n    id: int =
