A potential fix for this could be to give each class type variable a unique ID. This way there shouldn't be any confusion. \r\n\r\nThis would probably also imply updating the type to string conversion logic to not include type variable ids (currently shown as ``T`<id>``). I don't think that the best option is to just drop the type variable ids from messages, since there can be multiple logically separate type variables with the same name. One option would be to use `T`, `T'`, `T''` instead of ``T`1``, ``T`2``, etc. (where the first type variable with short name X doesn't get a prime, the second one gets a single prime, etc.).","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1099172346/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-14T13:18:55Z","updated_at":"2022-04-14T13:18:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12579","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12579/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12579/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12579/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12579","id":1203424558,"node_id":"I_kwDOAGuhRc5Hus0u","number":12579,"title":"Release
