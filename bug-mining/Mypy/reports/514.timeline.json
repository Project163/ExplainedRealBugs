have been pulling my hair out on trying to find an elegant way of separating the dataclasses, and I think I found an alright solution.\r\n\r\nAdditions:\r\n* Added two new classes `AptMessage_MGMSG_MOT_MOVE_COMPLETED_6_BYTES` and `AptMessage_MGMSG_MOT_MOVE_COMPLETED_20_BYTES` that inherit from a main `AptMessage_MGMSG_MOT_MOVE_COMPLETED` class. These reflect the two different possibilities of `MOVE_COMPLETED`  messages for the Thorlabs devices. One type contains only 6 header bytes, while the other type contains 6 bytes with an additional 14 data bytes. This can be seen on p.125 of the APT Communications Protocol.\r\n* Added their respective unit tests. \r\n* Updated the existing MPC320 driver to use this new dataclass.\r\n\r\nConsiderations:\r\n* As far as we know, the MPC320 prefers the 6 byte message, while the K10CR1 prefers the 20 byte message. However, we are still unsure of what future devices will prefer, so I have left the names ambiguous for that reason. But, the current names are kind of dumb, so if you have any better suggestions I will be grateful.\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n* [APT Communications Protocol](https://www.thorlabs.com/Software/Motion%20Control/APT_Communications_Protocol.pdf).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moonshot-nagayama-pj/PnPQ/issues/94/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/moonshot-nagayama-pj/PnPQ/issues/94/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2590813839","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/18458#issuecomment-2590813839","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18458","id":2590813839,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc6abK6P","user":{"login":"sterliakov","id":50529348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTI5MzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50529348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov","html_url":"https://github.com/sterliakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-14T18:29:11Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T18:29:11Z","body":"This is trivial to fix (as far as I understand, that's just a bug, and `active_self_type` is None when checking base class compatibility - but it has nothing to do with scope, `sub_info` is already the correct typeinfo, and free vars aren't important here?)\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/mypy/checker.py b/mypy/checker.py\nindex 79d178f3c..06e31cddd 100644\n--- a/mypy/checker.py\n+++ b/mypy/checker.py\n@@ -2232,8 +2232,8 @@ class TypeChecker(NodeVisitor[None], CheckerPluginInterface):\n                 is_class_method = sym.node.is_class\n \n             mapped_typ = cast(FunctionLike, map_type_from_supertype(typ, sub_info, super_info))\n-            active_self_type = self.scope.active_self_type()\n-            if isinstance(mapped_typ, Overloaded) and active_self_type:\n+            active_self_type = fill_typevars(sub_info)\n+            if isinstance(mapped_typ, Overloaded):\n                 # If we have an overload, filter to overloads that match the self type.\n                 # This avoids false positives for concrete subclasses of generic classes,\n                 # see testSelfTypeOverrideCompatibility for an example.\n```\n\nHowever, `Self` in argument position still bugs me.

very problem is not about `Self`, it can be reproduced with explicit typevars. This is obviously a usability+implementation complexity vs strictness tradeoff, and perhaps current approach is the most ergonomic one (though I'd prefer to reject Self and its typevar-based counterpart in any contravariant position in overrides, and so just stay away from Self in my own code entirely except for factory classmethods).","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2591302499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sterliakov","id":50529348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTI5MzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50529348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov","html_url":"https://github.com/sterliakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2592194851","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/18458#issuecomment-2592194851","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18458","id":2592194851,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc6agcEj","user":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-15T10:03:30Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T10:03:30Z","body":"> This very problem is not about Self, it can be reproduced with explicit typevars.\n\nWhen I say from the very beginning I mean from the very beginning.
