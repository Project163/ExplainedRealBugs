You cannot currently say \"disable errors called on `numpy` objects\" - this is a difficult to implement and rarely useful feature.\r\n\r\nthis would be a **ubiquitously** useful feature, as it would allow projects to maintain fully strict typing while excepting calls made out to third party libraries that are not fully typed.     As it is now, any third party library on pypi that isn't fully typed itself is unusable with an application that wishes to maintain strict typing for its own calls.\r\n\r\nI agree that the \"disallow_untyped_calls\" refers to calls made in the target source file, however this use should be clarified in the documentation, as you can see a lot of people hit this and are confused by it.  Also, the fact that mypy currently has no way for full \"strict\" use while using third party libraries that have functions untyped should be noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1542228443/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zzzeek","id":128223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODIyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/128223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek","html_url":"https://github.com/zzzeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzeek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1548017014","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10757#issuecomment-1548017014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10757","id":1548017014,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5cRN12","user":{"login":"samskiter","id":1271643,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzE2NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1271643?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskiter","html_url":"https://github.com/samskiter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskiter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskiter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskiter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskiter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskiter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskiter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskiter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskiter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samskiter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-15T14:50:46Z","updated_at":"2023-05-15T14:50:46Z","body":"Just started using mypy and ran into this issue in <48 hours.
