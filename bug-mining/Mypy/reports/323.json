Set up a virtualenv with Python 3.11 and activate it.\r\n1. `pip install mypy`\r\n1. ` python-m mypy --strict --no-silence-site-packages --disallow-any-unimported -m mypy`\r\n\r\nBoth `--no-silence-site-packages` and `--disallow-any-unimported` need to be present.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0.0 of mypy is required. Older versions don't exhibit this error.\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest way we have found to reproduce this problem, but we first encountered it in one of our own projects.\r\n\r\nThe issue is being filed here because the `mypy` docs for reporting bugs says that problems with a specific library function should be reported here. We're not seeing this error with any other functions.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14796/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14796/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
