Mypy crashes on this snippet:\n\n```py\nfrom typing import TypeVar\n\nT = TypeVar(\"T\", bound=Foo)\n\nclass Foo: ...\nclass Bar[T]: ...\n```\n\nThe following things must all be true for the crash to occur:\n- The global-scope TypeVar must have the same name as the type parameter used for `Bar`\n- The global-scope TypeVar must have a `bound=` argument that uses a forward reference\n- The forward reference in the global-scope TypeVar's bound _must be unquoted_. (For `.py` files, you generally need to quote all forward references, but this is not true for stubs.)\n\n**Traceback**\n\n```pytb\n% mypy foo.py --python-version=3.12 --show-traceback\nfoo.py:6: error: INTERNAL ERROR -- Please try using mypy master on GitHub:\nhttps://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#using-a-development-mypy-build\nPlease report a bug at https://github.com/python/mypy/issues\nversion: 1.15.0+dev.58de753b6b76227ff726e9ce1888cfc24c7ba44b\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/typeshed/.venv/bin/mypy\", line 8, in <module>\n    sys.exit(console_entry())\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/__main__.py\", line 15, in console_entry\n    main()\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/main.py\", line 119, in main\n    res, messages, blockers = run_build(sources, options, fscache, t0, stdout, stderr)\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/main.py\", line 203, in run_build\n    res = build.build(sources, options, None, flush_errors, fscache, stdout, stderr)\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/build.py\", line 191, in build\n    result = _build(\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/build.py\", line 267, in _build\n    graph = dispatch(sources, manager, stdout)\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/build.py\", line 2937, in dispatch\n    process_graph(graph, manager)\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/build.py\", line 3335, in process_graph\n    process_stale_scc(graph, scc, manager)\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/build.py\", line 3430, in process_stale_scc\n    mypy.semanal_main.semantic_analysis_for_scc(graph, scc, manager.errors)\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/semanal_main.py\", line 93, in semantic_analysis_for_scc\n    process_top_levels(graph, scc, patches)\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/semanal_main.py\", line 220, in process_top_levels\n    deferred, incomplete, progress = semantic_analyze_target(\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/semanal_main.py\", line 351, in semantic_analyze_target\n    analyzer.refresh_partial(\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/semanal.py\", line 646, in refresh_partial\n    self.refresh_top_level(node)\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/semanal.py\", line 657, in refresh_top_level\n    self.accept(d)\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/semanal.py\", line 7241, in accept\n    node.accept(self)\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/nodes.py\", line 1177, in accept\n    return visitor.visit_class_def(self)\n           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/semanal.py\", line 1728, in visit_class_def\n    self.analyze_class(defn)\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/semanal.py\", line 1869, in analyze_class\n    bases, tvar_defs, is_protocol = self.clean_up_bases_and_infer_type_variables(\n                                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^\n        defn, bases, context=defn\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    )\n    ^\n  File \"/Users/alexw/dev/mypy/mypy/semanal.py\", line 2174, in clean_up_bases_and_infer_type_variables\n    assert isinstance(node.node, TypeVarLikeExpr)\n           ~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nAssertionError:\n```\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\nPaste the above snippet into a `foo.py` file and run `mypy --python-version=3.12 foo.py --show-traceback`\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n- Mypy version used: `1.15.0+dev.58de753b6b76227ff726e9ce1888cfc24c7ba44b`\n- Mypy command-line flags: `--python-version=3.12 --show-traceback`\n- Python version used: 3.13.1","closed_by":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18507/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
