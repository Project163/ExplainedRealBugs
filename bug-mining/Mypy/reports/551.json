Mypy usually understands that, but not when union is behind an alias.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n[playground](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=master&python=3.12&flags=strict&gist=4a1a19c716649defc7832b9fa1a03bdf)\n\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom typing import Literal\n\nclass E(Enum):\n    A = 'a'\n    B = 'b'\n    C = 'c'\n    \nA = Literal[E.A]\nB = Literal[E.B, E.C]\n\ndef f(x: A | B) -> None: ...\ndef f2(x: A | Literal[E.B, E.C]) -> None: ...\ndef f3(x: Literal[E.A] | B) -> None: ...\n\ndef main(x: E) -> None:\n    f(x)  # E: Argument 1 to \"f\" has incompatible type \"E\"; expected \"Literal[E.A] | Literal[E.B, E.C]\"  [arg-type]\n    f2(x)\n    f3(x)  # E: Argument 1 to \"f\" has incompatible type \"E\"; expected \"Literal[E.A] | Literal[E.B, E.C]\"  [arg-type]\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nSuccess, 0 errors.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\n```\nmain.py:17: error: Argument 1 to \"f\" has incompatible type \"E\"; expected \"Literal[E.A] | Literal[E.B, E.C]\"  [arg-type]\nmain.py:19: error: Argument 1 to \"f3\" has incompatible type \"E\"; expected \"Literal[E.A] | Literal[E.B, E.C]\"  [arg-type]\nFound 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n```\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\n\n- Mypy version used: 1.15.0 and master\n- Mypy command-line flags: n/a\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): n/a\n- Python version used: 3.12\n\nI have a patch for this - just a small impl omission.
