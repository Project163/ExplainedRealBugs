The error message is clear `The following method was marked implicitly abstract because it has an empty function body: \"optional_method\". If it is not meant to be abstract, explicitly return None.` and I don't get the big deal over doing:\r\n```\r\n    def optional_method(self) -> None:\r\n        return None\r\n```\r\nIt much more clearly communicates something is different than the difference between \"...\" and \"pass\". So I'd vote to close this issue.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1262735051/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1262770206","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13770#issuecomment-1262770206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13770","id":1262770206,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5LRFge","user":{"login":"cmeyer","id":34664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmeyer","html_url":"https://github.com/cmeyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmeyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmeyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmeyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmeyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmeyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmeyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmeyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmeyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmeyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-29T20:19:12Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T20:19:12Z","body":"To many programmers, particularly from other languages like C++, this goes against common programming idioms.
