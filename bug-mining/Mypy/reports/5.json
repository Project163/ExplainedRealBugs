Mypy could also support this convention for custom search paths. This would make dealing with mixed Python 2/3 codebases a little easier.\r\n\r\nIf there is a user-defined mypy search path directory `foo`, first look for files under `foo/@python2` when type checking in Python 2 mode. Ignore `@python2` directories in Python 3 mode. We should still look into `foo` as well if a module is not found under the `@python2` subdirectory.\r\n\r\nThis should work with `mypy_path` in a config file and the `MYPYPATH` environment variable. This is mostly useful with stubs, but this would work will regular Python files as well.","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10391/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
