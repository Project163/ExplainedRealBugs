Report**\r\nI have two small similar examples for you:\r\n1:\r\n```py\r\ndef f(x: object, y: object) -> int | None: # Missing return statement\r\n    match x, y:\r\n        case int(), int() if True:\r\n            return 42\r\n        case _:\r\n            return None\r\n```\r\n\r\n2:\r\n```py\r\ndef f(x: object, y: object) -> int | None: # Missing return statement\r\n    match x, y:\r\n        case _, _ if True:\r\n            return 42\r\n        case _:\r\n            return None\r\n```\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n1. No `Missing return statement` error, because code after `match` statement is unreachable.\r\n2. No `Missing return statement` error and error `statement is unreachable` on line `case _:`\r\n \r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n1. Error `Missing return statement`.\r\n2. Error `Missing return statement`. No `statement is unreachable` error on line `case _:`\r\n\r\nError `Missing return statement` will disappear if i remove `if True:` condition (in both cases).\r\nError `statement is unreachable` will appear if i replace `case _, _:` with `case _:`. Removing condition doesnt help.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n- Mypy version used: mypy 0.982 (compiled: no)\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: no\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini`: no\r\n- Python version used: 3.11\r\n- Windows 10\r\n\r\n**And now for something a bit different**\r\n```py\r\ndef f(x: object, y: object) -> int | None:\r\n    match x, y:\r\n        case int(), int():\r\n            return x + y # Unsupported left operand type for + (\"object\")\r\n        case _:\r\n            return None\r\n```\r\nMypy cannot narrow types of tuple
