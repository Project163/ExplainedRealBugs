Report**\r\n\r\nThis is a variant of #7281 that still crashes incremental checking on 0.910 and `master` (9f409c3d89c7fa65eff8cf67883473487e6effd4), both of which include #10432, which was supposed to fix #7281.\r\n\r\nThe difference in this case is that the local `NamedTuple` is defined inside a class method rather than a global function.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n#!/bin/sh
