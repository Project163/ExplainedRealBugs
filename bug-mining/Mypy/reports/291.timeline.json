mypy issues a false positive on this code, where `Foo` is iterable by virtue of having `Meta` as its metaclass:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Iterator\r\nclass Meta(type):\r\n    def __iter__(cls) -> Iterator[int]:\r\n        yield from [1, 2, 3]\r\n\r\nclass Foo(metaclass=Meta): ...\r\n\r\na, b, c = Foo  # error: \"Type[Foo]\" object is not iterable  [misc]\r\nreveal_type(a)  # error: Cannot determine type of \"a\"  [has-type]  # note: Revealed type is \"Any\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that false positive.\r\n\r\nI started working on this PR hoping to address #14782, but wasn't able to -- this PR improves the situation somewhat, but doesn't close the issue. Prior to this PR, mypy had this behaviour:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom enum import Enum\r\n\r\nclass E(Enum):\r\n    A = 1\r\n    B = 2\r\n\r\nA, B = E  #  error: \"Type[E]\" object is not iterable  [misc]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR, mypy has this behaviour instead:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom enum import Enum\r\n\r\nclass E(Enum):\r\n    A = 1\r\n    B = 2\r\n\r\nA, B = E  # error: Need type annotation for \"A\"  [var-annotated]  # error: Need type annotation for \"B\"  [var-annotated]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because there's a `TypeVar` being used in [typeshed's stub for `EnumMeta.__iter__`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/904407f8e4967c73bfe18fecc089cf8d22e285ce/stdlib/enum.pyi#L107): I wasn't able to figure out how to get mypy to solve the type variable in

#14782\r\n\r\nCurrently, mypy issues a false positive if you try to unpack an enum class:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom enum import Enum\r\n\r\nclass E(Enum):\r\n    A = 1\r\n    B = 2\r\n\r\nA, B = E  #  error: \"Type[E]\" object is not iterable  [misc]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because of a more general problem with class objects that have `__iter__` defined on their metaclass. Mypy issues a false positive on this code, where `Foo` is iterable by virtue of having `Meta` as its metaclass:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Iterator\r\nclass Meta(type):\r\n    def __iter__(cls) -> Iterator[int]:\r\n        yield from [1, 2, 3]\r\n\r\nclass Foo(metaclass=Meta): ...\r\n\r\na, b, c = Foo  # error: \"Type[Foo]\" object is not iterable  [misc]\r\nreveal_type(a)  # error: Cannot determine type of \"a\"  [has-type]  # note: Revealed type is \"Any\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the false positive with enums, and the more general false positive with iterable class objects.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14827/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14827/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8676870406,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5fXEHzzwAAAAIFLokG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/8676870406","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-06T17:16:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8676870534,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5fXEHzzwAAAAIFLomG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/8676870534","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b6cb0ed4b2e2155eddaed0bb303631ddd04ad44b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/b6cb0ed4b2e2155eddaed0bb303631ddd04ad44b","created_at":"2023-03-06T17:16:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
