Report**\r\n\r\nWhen there's a top-level type-ignore with error code, like ``# type: ignore[no-untyped-defs]``, and ``--warn-unused-ignores`` is passed, this type comment always shows up as an unused ignore, even though the type checking would fail without that comment.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nCreate this file:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# type: ignore[no-untyped-def]\r\n\r\ndef untyped(): pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun using ``mypy test.py --strict``. (which includes ``--warn-unused-ignores``)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nThis should pass, because removing the type comment causes the ``no-untyped-def`` error to
