Report**\n\nUsing `TypeGuard` or `TypeIs` on the `__call__` method on an object that is created in the if statement is broken.\n\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypeGuard\n\nclass E:\n    def __init__(self) -> None: ...\n    def __call__(self, o: object) -> TypeGuard[int]:\n        return True\n\nx = object()\n\nif E()(x):\n    reveal_type(x)\n```\n\nor\n\n```python\nfrom typing_extensions import TypeIs\n\nclass E:\n    def __init__(self) -> None: ...\n    def __call__(self, o: object) -> TypeIs[int]:\n        return True\n\nx = object()\n\nif E()(x):\n    reveal_type(x)\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nThis should return:\n\n```\nmain.py:11: note: Revealed type is \"builtins.int\"\n```\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\nActually returns\n\n```\nmain.py:11: note: Revealed type is \"builtins.object\"\n```\n\n**Working Versions**\n\nNote that if you define the object first it acts correctly:\n\n```python\ny = object()\no = E()\nif o(y):\n    reveal_type(y)\n```\n\n```\nmain.py:16: note: Revealed type is \"builtins.int\"\n```\n\nOr if it is a different method, it also works correctly:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import TypeGuard\n\nclass E:\n    def __init__(self) -> None: ...\n    def m(self, o: object) -> TypeGuard[int]:\n        return True\n\nx = object()\n\nif E().m(x):\n    reveal_type(x)\n```\n\n```\nmain.py:11: note: Revealed type is \"builtins.int\"\n```\n\n\n**Your Environment**\n\nMypy playground 1.17.0 on Python 3.12\n\n**EDIT**: made examples smaller by removing generics\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19575/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
