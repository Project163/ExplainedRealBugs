with a regular identity as a decorator it works fine:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Callable, TypeVar\r\n\r\nC = TypeVar('C', bound=Callable)\r\n\r\ndef dec(f: C) -> C:\r\n    return f\r\n\r\nlambda: foo() == 2\r\n\r\n@dec\r\ndef foo() -> int:\r\n    return 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother surprising discovery: it also works fine when both the function and the lambda are enclosed:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Callable, TypeVar\r\n\r\nC = TypeVar('C', bound=Callable)\r\n\r\ndef dec(val: None) -> Callable[[C], C]:\r\n    def wrapper(f):\r\n        return f\r\n

making a decorator for providing function usage examples for [deal](https://github.com/life4/deal):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@deal.example(lambda: double1(2) == 4)\r\ndef double1(x: int) -> int:\r\n
