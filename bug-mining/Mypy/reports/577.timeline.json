just uploaded mypy 1.16 to the Python Package Index (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/mypy/\">PyPI</a>).\nMypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features and bug fixes.\nYou can install it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.io\">Read the Docs</a>.</p>\n<h3>Different Property Getter and Setter Types</h3>\n<p>Mypy now supports using different types for a property getter and setter:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code>class A:\n    _value: int\n<pre><code>@property\ndef foo(self) -&amp;gt; int:\n    return self._value\n\n@foo.setter\ndef foo(self, x: str | int) -&amp;gt; None:\n    try:\n        self._value = int(x)\n    except ValueError:\n        raise Exception(f&amp;quot;'{x}' is not a valid value for 'foo'&amp;quot;)\n</code></pre>\n<p></code></pre></p>\n<p>This was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/python/mypy/pull/18510\">18510</a>).</p>\n<h3>Flexible Variable Redefinitions (Experimental)</h3>\n<p>Mypy now allows unannotated variables to be freely redefined with\ndifferent types when using the experimental <code>--allow-redefinition-new</code>\nflag. You will also need to enable <code>--local-partial-types</code>. Mypy will\nnow infer a union type when different types are assigned to a\nvariable:</p>\n<pre lang=\"py\"><code># mypy: allow-redefinition-new, local-partial-types\n<p>def f(n: int, b: bool) -&gt; int | str:\nif b:\nx = n\nelse:\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
