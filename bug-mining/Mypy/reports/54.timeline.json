https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/10852 is merged we can work on making `@enum.unique` to check for actually unique values.\r\n\r\nRight now it does nothing. In other words, this code passes `mypy` check:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom enum import Enum, unique\r\n\r\n@unique\r\nclass A(Enum):\r\n   x = 1\r\n   y = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, fails in

implicitly `final` and their values will be inferred as `Literal` types, this gives us some space to check that we have `unique` literal values inside `mypy/plugins/enums.py`\r\n\r\n## Corner case\r\n\r\nWe should ignore any non-`Literal` values from this check:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef rand_int() -> int:\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n@unique \r\nclass A(Enum):\r\n    x = rand_int()\r\n    y =
