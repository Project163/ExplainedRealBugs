However, `attrs` has a couple ways to check or annotate that a class is an `attr.s`-decorated class: `attr.has` and `attr.AttrsInstance`, neither of which seem to be supported by mypy right now.\r\n\r\n`attr.AttrsInstance` is a protocol defined in the attrs internal stubs (https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/blob/main/src/attr/__init__.pyi#L74) that represents that an object of an `attr.s`-decorated class. Right now, the plugin doesn't recognize `attr.AttrsInstance`, so it will report an error when trying to call e.g. `attr.fields` on a `type[attr.AttrsInstance]`.\r\n\r\n`attr.has` is a method that checks whether a class is `attr.s`-decorated. The plugin won't recognize this as a valid way to ensure  `attrs` version 22.2.0 updated the internal stubs for `attr.has` to be a `TypeGuard` for `type[attr.AttrsInstance]`: (https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/blob/main/src/attr/__init__.pyi#L541), so supporting `attr.AttrsInstance` may be sufficient when using sufficiently new stubs for `attrs`.\r\n\r\n**Pitch**\r\n\r\nA possible use for `attr.has`:\r\n```\r\nT = TypeVar('T')\r\n\r\ndef deserialize(attr_cls: type[T], value:bytes) -> T:\r\n    assert attr.has(cls)\r\n    fields = attr.fields(cls)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nA possible use for `attr.AttrsInstance`:\r\n```\r\nT = TypeVar('T', bound=attr.AttrsInstance)\r\n\r\ndef deserialize(attr_cls: type[T], value: bytes) -> T:\r\n    fields = attr.fields(attr_cls)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15980/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15980/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
