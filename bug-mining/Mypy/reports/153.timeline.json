`StrEnum`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`enum.property` is not yet supported:\r\n\r\n- #12483\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe new `enum.verify` decorator isn't supported:  the following snippet will raise an exception at runtime on 3.11 due to not all values being unique, but it passes mypy:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom enum import Enum, verify, UNIQUE\r\n\r\n@verify(UNIQUE)\r\nclass Color(Enum):\r\n    RED = 1\r\n    GREEN = 2\r\n    BLUE = 3\r\n    CRIMSON = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n`enum.member`/`enum.nonmember`. The docs are a bit thin on these, but it looks like in the following enum, BAR is converted to become a member, but BAZ\r\nis not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom enum import Enum, nonmember\r\n\r\nclass Foo(Enum):\r\n    BAR = 1\r\n    BAZ = nonmember(2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(These two can also be used as decorators)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`ReprEnum`: this doesn't need any special support by mypy, but the following mypy bug but means that it can't really be used idiomatically at the moment:\r\n\r\n- #12787\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`StrEnum`: I didn't think this required any special treatment from mypy, but there's a weird bug here in mypy's handling of `StrEnum`:\r\n\r\n-
