If stubtest doesn't ensure that `__all__` is present in the stub, this means such users could get false positives when using such stubs.\r\n\r\nHowever, if `__all__` isn't in `__all__` is it a public API? stubtest *will* ensure that `__all__` is present in the stub if `__all__` is in `__all__`.\r\n\r\nAnyway, busywork is my main concern here.
