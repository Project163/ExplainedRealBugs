 Use this form only if mypy reports an \"INTERNAL ERROR\" and/or gives a traceback.\n  Please include the traceback and all other messages below (use `mypy --show-traceback`).\n-->\n\n**Crash Report**\n\nWhen being told to typecheck a module that contains a class which is both derived from `NamedTuple` _and_ decorated with `@dataclass` (probably by mistake, but no matter), Mypy installed in a Python 3.13+ environment will crash.\n\nIt seems to work fine for Python < 3.13.\n\n**Traceback**\n\n```pycon\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \".../bin/mypy\", line 12, in <module>\n    sys.exit(console_entry())\n             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^\n  File \".../mypy/__main__.py\", line 15, in console_entry\n    main()\n    ~~~~^^\n  File \"mypy/main.py\", line 119, in main\n  File

Reproduce**\n\nCreate a file named `bug.py` with these contents:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import NamedTuple\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\n@dataclass\nclass A(NamedTuple):\n  a: int\n  b: str\n```\n\nRun Mypy installed in a Python 3.13 environment on this file, e.g. using `uvx`:\n\n```bash\nuvx --python 3.13 --reinstall mypy --show-traceback bug.py\n```\n\nReplacing `3.13` with `3.12` or earlier, you can check that it worked fine for earlier Python versions.\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n- Mypy version used: 1.15.0 (compiled: yes)\n- Mypy command-line flags: *None needed*\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): *None needed*\n- Python version used: 3.13+ required to reproduce this\n- Operating system and version: Debian Linux 12 (bookworm), but also happened on another machine running some version of
