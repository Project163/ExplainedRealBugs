you're not sure whether what you're experiencing is a mypy bug, please see the \"Question and Help\" form instead.\r\nPlease consider:\r\n\r\n- checking our common issues page: https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html\r\n- searching our issue tracker: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues to see if it's already been reported\r\n- asking on gitter chat: https://gitter.im/python/typing\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Bug Report**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf you're reporting a problem with a specific library function, the typeshed tracker is better suited for this report: https://github.com/python/typeshed/issues\r\n\r\nIf the project you encountered the issue in is open source, please provide a link to the project.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI'm a bit unsure about whether this is supposed to work or not. The example seems to type check in VSCode, indicating that pyright can infer and match the type properly.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Union, Callable, TypeVar\r\n\r\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\r\n\r\ndef my_func(maybe_lazy: Union[Callable[[], T], T]) -> T:\r\n    ...\r\n\r\na: str = my_func(\"foo\")\r\nb: str = my_func(lambda: \"foo\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nType checks without error.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nmypy complains with the following in the last line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmain.py:9: error: Argument 1 to \"my_func\" has incompatible type \"Callable[[], str]\"; expected \"Callable[[], <nothing>]\"\r\nmain.py:9: error: Return statement in function which does not return\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that there is spurious \"return statement in function which does not return\" hinting to a similarity with https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13014 and https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10520 but I think this is a coincidence of using a lambda. Modifying the example to\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Union, Callable, TypeVar\r\n\r\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\r\n\r\ndef my_func(maybe_lazy: Union[Callable[[], T], T]) -> T:\r\n    ...\r\n\r\ndef produce_a_string() -> str:\r\n    return \"foo\"\r\n\r\na: str = my_func(\"foo\")\r\nb: str = my_func(produce_a_string)\r\n```\r\n\r\ngets rid of the \"return statement in function which does not return\" but still errors with \"incompatible type\".\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n[Reproduction example on mypy playground](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.10&gist=318ddd5d95aad8df5f3f5995f21e8c2e)\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 0.981\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: None (playground default)\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): None (playground default)\r\n- Python version used: 3.10\r\n\r\n<!-- You can freely edit this text, please remove all
