#14108 \r\n\r\nThis fixes both new and old style of working with self types. After all I fixed the new style by simply expanding self type, then `bind_self()` does its job, so effect on the instance will be the same.\r\n\r\nI had two options fixing this, other one (that I didn't go with) is making the callable generic in new style, if it appears in `ClassVar`. This however has two downsides: implementation is tricky, and this adds and edge case to an existing edge case. So instead I choose internal consistency within the new style, rather than similarity between old and new style.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7838193361,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5WdW2yzwAAAAHTMVbR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7838193361","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-17T22:01:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7838193750,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5WdW2yzwAAAAHTMVhW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7838193750","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"401798fe7f36dc2e664bfae773c9faf5033aa6df","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/401798fe7f36dc2e664bfae773c9faf5033aa6df","created_at":"2022-11-17T22:01:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
