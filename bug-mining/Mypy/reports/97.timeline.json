Description\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11509\r\n\r\n> **Pitch** `# type:ignore` comments risk suppressing an unintended error, which is why it's preferred to specify the exact error code you're suppressing\r\n\r\nThis introduces a new error code `ignore-without-code` which achieves that. ~I've gone with naming this `warn-` rather than `disallow-` since the ignores are still obeyed, just alerted about (and also as the most closely related options are also `warn-` style).~ This is disabled by default but can be controlled via the `--enable-error-code` machinery.\r\n\r\nThis new option is aware of `--warn-unused-ignores` (since they're likely to be used together) such that we don't emit warnings about a lack of error codes if the ignore is unused and that option is turned on.\r\n\r\n~One thing I'm not sure about is what should happen for ignore comments that apply to a whole file. I've raised this on that issue, so discussion should probably happen there.~ Currently the new option obeys that instruction to ignore the file.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\nSome manual testing, plus automated tests added.\r\n\r\n### Code Review\r\n\r\n~I'm fairly happy with the code approach here, though I'm not at all sure that I've put the command line option in the right places. I also suspect I've missed some places that would need updating in the docs. Guidance around the proper places to put the docs/CLI arg/etc. is most welcome.~ (I believe I've now caught everywhere that this needs to go)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11633/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":6,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/981215827","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11509#issuecomment-981215827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11509","id":981215827,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc46fCpT","user":{"login":"DetachHead","id":57028336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI4MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57028336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead","html_url":"https://github.com/DetachHead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-29T01:30:26Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T01:30:26Z","body":"@PeterJCLaw
