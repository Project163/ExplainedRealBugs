#12886\r\n\r\n`contract_starred_pattern_types` and `expand_starred_pattern_types` are sort of like inverses of each other, so you get crashes if `contracted_inner_types` and `contracted_new_inner_types` don't correspond (in the case that `can_match` gets set to `False`). ~When `can_match` is False, we don't need `contracted_new_inner_types`, so this PR just moves an if statement up a little bit and indent everything.~ I'm not sure `can_match` is doing anything useful, so this PR now just gets rid of it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13731/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7460707600,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5KlbgtzwAAAAG8sV0Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7460707600","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-09-26T16:44:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7460708133,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5KlbgtzwAAAAG8sV8l","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7460708133","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"176b0525aadd2c8466a0bba088ed3cdaa930594c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/176b0525aadd2c8466a0bba088ed3cdaa930594c","created_at":"2022-09-26T16:44:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
