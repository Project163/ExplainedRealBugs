Wild guess: This probably happens because they are not a single entity, but a unary minus applied to a positive integer. Funnily enough, the non-overlapping equality check seems to get this right.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nConsider the following code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Literal, Union\r\n\r\nFoo = Union[Literal[-1], Literal[42]]\r\n\r\n\r\ndef correct(f: Foo) -> None:\r\n    if f == 42:\r\n        reveal_type(f)  # Revealed type is 'Literal[42]'\r\n    else:\r\n        reveal_type(f)  # Revealed type is 'Literal[-1]'\r\n\r\n\r\ndef also_correct(f: Foo) -> None:\r\n    if f == -2:\r\n        reveal_type(f)  # Non-overlapping equality check (left operand type: \"Union[Literal[-1], Literal[42]]\", right operand type: \"Literal[-2]\")\r\n    else:\r\n        reveal_type(f)  # Revealed type is 'Union[Literal[-1], Literal[42]]'\r\n\r\n\r\ndef wrong(f: Foo) -> None:\r\n    if f == -1:\r\n        reveal_type(f)  # Revealed type is '<nothing>'\r\n    else:\r\n        reveal_type(f)  # Revealed type is 'Union[Literal[-1], Literal[42]]'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\nThe revealed types in `wrong` should be the same as in `correct`, only swapped.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\nMypy is confused. :wink: \r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n- Mypy version used: 0.812\r\n- Python version used: 3.8.10\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10514/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10514/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
