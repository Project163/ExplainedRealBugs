However, [mypy won't walk up the filesystem](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#the-mypy-configuration-file) to discover the `mypy.ini` file at the top-level.  Contrast that with [ruff's discovery rules](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/configuration/#pyprojecttoml-discovery) which *do* walk up the filesystem until it finds a `ruff.toml` file.\r\n\r\nThere are workarounds: 1) symlink the subprojects's `mypy.ini` to the root level `mypy.ini`; 2) copy the same `mypy.ini` file into each subpackage directory.  Neither option is all that great.  A rule similar to ruff's would let me eliminate the symlinks and move the `mypy.ini` file to the root of my repo, so that its settings can be easily shared across all subpackages in my monorepo.","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16070/reactions","total_count":19,"+1":19,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16070/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
