notes for posterity:\r\n* This issue only occurs when\r\n    1. `__getitem__` is typed to accept arbitrary-length tuples (`tuple[T, ...]`), and\r\n    2. the index includes a star expression (`*index`), and\r\n    3. the index also includes a slice expression.\r\n* If any of the above conditions aren't satisfied, you'll get a clearer error along the lines `Invalid index type \"tuple[T1, ...]\" for \"Foo\"; expected type \"tuple[T2 ...]\"` instead of the slew of `Argument n to <tuple> has incompatible type` errors (ideally, this case should emit the first kind of error too).\r\n* In brief, this issue happens because\r\n  * When a tuple expression contains a star expression `(*xyz,)`, mypy infers the overall type by treating this as a call to a hidden tuple-constructor function with the signature `def [T] (*T) -> tuple[T, ...]`\r\n  * In order to resolve the type variable in the tuple-constructor, mypy looks at the type context and tries to match it against the return type. Here, the type context is the parameter to `__getitem__`. If there's a match (as is the case when `__getitem__` is typed to accept a variable-length tuple), mypy will resolve the type variable using the parameter type. In the example above, where `__getitem__` accepts a `tuple[str, ...]`, this results in the tuple-constructor signature getting resolved to `def (*str) -> tuple[str, ...]`\r\n  * If mypy resolved the type variable using the type context, then type errors will be emitted for any incompatible arguments to the tuple-constructor. This is where the `Argument n to <tuple> has incompatible type` errors come from.\r\n  * When an argument comes from a slice expression, the context for the error message will be the corresponding `SliceExpr` node. Currently, mypy doesn't set line information on these nodes, which is why the error message has no line number. (This is apparently because slice expressions don't contain line information in the raw ast in Python 3.8).\r\n  * Since the overall type of the tuple expression is copied from the type context (`__getitem__`), the actual call to `__getitem__` type checks, hence no `Invalid index type X for Y` error is emitted\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2481260517/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brianschubert","id":25313350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzEzMzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25313350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert","html_url":"https://github.com/brianschubert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2481494673","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/17655#issuecomment-2481494673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17655","id":2481494673,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc6T6JqR","user":{"login":"brianschubert","id":25313350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzEzMzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25313350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert","html_url":"https://github.com/brianschubert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-17T19:48:09Z","updated_at":"2024-11-17T19:48:09Z","body":"Because slice expressions don't contain information in the raw ast before Python 3.9, fixing this while mypy still supports 3.8 is a bit complicated.
