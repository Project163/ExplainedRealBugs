appears to have changed behaviour in mypy 1.15 -- I personally prefer the behaviour in 1.15 but would understand if it needed to change.  I don't see it mentioned in the changelog however\n\n**Bug Report**\n\nwe're working on incrementally typing a large codebase -- often this means fixing a particular callsite or file at a time (sometimes by intentionally ignoring errors unfortunately)\n\nit seems that in a module with a particular error code (temporarily) disabled, `--warn-unused-ignores` will complain about a \"correct\" type ignore (I say \"correct\" here as it _will_ complain when the file is no longer blocklisted) -- will provide a small example below\n\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n```python\n# t.py\ndef f() -> None:\n    x: int = 'hi'  # type: ignore[assignment]\n```\n\n```ini\n[mypy]\nwarn_unused_ignores = true\n[mypy-t]\ndisable_error_code = assignment\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\n```console\n$ mypy --version\nmypy 1.15.0 (compiled: yes)\n$ mypy t.py\nSuccess: no issues found in 1 source file\n```\n\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\n```console\n$ mypy --version\nmypy 1.16.0 (compiled: yes)\n$ mypy t.py\nt.py:2: error: Unused \"type: ignore\" comment  [unused-ignore]\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n```\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\n\n- Mypy version used: 1.16.0 (regression from 1.15.0)\n- Mypy command-line flags: (see above)\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): (see above)\n- Python version used: 3.13.1\n\n<!-- You can freely edit this text, please remove all the lines you believe are unnecessary. -->\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19237/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18493481949,"node_id":"MADE_lADOAGuhRc466YpYzwAAAAROTCPd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/18493481949","actor":{"login":"brianschubert","id":25313350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzEzMzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25313350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert","html_url":"https://github.com/brianschubert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"marked_as_duplicate","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-06T20:08:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
