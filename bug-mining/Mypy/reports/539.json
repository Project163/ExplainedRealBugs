It uses this simple code:\n```python\nclass Cls:\n    def __init__(self, a = 1, b = None):\n        self.a = a\n        self.b = b\n```\nNote how `b` has a default value, but that value is `None`. This is different from an argument that has no default.\n\nTo reproduce:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/multimeric/StubgenBug\ncd StubgenBug/\nuv run stubgen --inspect-mode -m tmp_dmnkkm8uuq\ncat out/tmp_dmnkkm8uuq/__init__.pyi\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\nI would expect `b` to indicate the default value exists:\n```python\nclass Cls:\n    def __init__(self, a: int = ..., b = ...) -> None: ...\n```\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n`b` doesn't have a default:\n```python\nclass Cls:\n    def __init__(self, a: int = ..., b) -> None: ...\n```\n<!-- What went wrong? Paste mypy's output. -->\n\n**Your Environment**\n\nPython 3.12.6\nstubgen 1.15.0","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18757/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
