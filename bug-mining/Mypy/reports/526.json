Params is a TypedDict. When accessing `Derived.Params` on a class that does not define its own params, this of course obtains `Base.Params`. But mypy gets confused and doesn't see the keys defined on the TypedDict.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/mypy-play/e3f7a74856e6710fdf2c70113a2b1e19\n\n```python\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\n\nclass Base:\n    class Params(TypedDict, total=False):\n        name: str\n\nclass Derived(Base):\n    pass\n\nclass DerivedOverride(Base):\n    class Params(Base.Params):\n        pass\n\n\nbob1 = Base.Params(name=\"Robert\")\nbob2 = Derived.Params(name=\"Robert\")      # spurious error here!\nbob3 = DerivedOverride.Params(name=\"Robert\")\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nThe gist above typechecks cleanly.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\n```\nmain.py:16: error: Unexpected keyword argument \"name\" for \"Params\"  [call-arg]\n/layers/google.python.pip/pip/lib/python3.12/site-packages/mypy/typeshed/stdlib/builtins.pyi:110: note: \"Params\" defined here\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n```\n\nhttps://mypy-play.net/?mypy=1.14.1&python=3.12&gist=e3f7a74856e6710fdf2c70113a2b1e19\n\n**Your Environment**\n\nDefaults from mypy Playground (latest version = 1.14.1 as of this writing).","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18600/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
