I propose to give it a specific name like `unsafe-overload`.\r\n\r\nDue to the absence of [`Intersection`](https://github.com/python/typing/issues/213) and [`Not`](https://github.com/python/typing/issues/801), this check raises false positives in certain code, for example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@overload\r\ndef foo(x: Vector) -> Vector: ...\r\n@overload\r\ndef foo(x: Iterable[Vector]) -> list[Vector]: ...\r\ndef foo(x):\r\n   if isinstance(x, Vector):\r\n      return x\r\n   return list(map(foo, x))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `Vector` implements `__iter__`. Obviously, what we really mean here is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@overload\r\ndef foo(x: Vector) -> Vector: ...\r\n@overload\r\ndef foo(x: Iterable[Vector] & Not[Vector]) -> list[Vector]: ...\r\ndef foo(x):\r\n   if isinstance(x, Vector):\r\n      return x\r\n   return list(map(foo, x))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is actually implicit by the ordering of overloads. The latter would not raise `unsafe-overload`, since `Iterable[Vector] & Not[Vector]` is not a subtype of `Vector`. But since it can't be expressed in the current type system, there needs to be a simple way to silence this check.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16060/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16060/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
