I do not know if it is really related.\r\n\r\nWith `--strict`, referring to variables imported from a non-py.typed module in another module causes mypy to output two error messages of the form `Module has no attribute A; maybe B?` and `Module has no attribute B; maybe A?`, for the same module. This obviously does not make a whole lot of sense.\r\n\r\nI do not know if this applies generally to non-py.typed packages or if there's something special about the diffusers package I used.\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce**\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ pip install diffusers==0.5.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n(see the Environment section for the precise packages installed by this)\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# bug.py\r\nfrom diffusers import StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline, StableDiffusionPipeline\r\n\r\n# bug2.py\r\nimport bug\r\n\r\nprint(bug.StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline)\r\nprint(bug.StableDiffusionPipeline)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mypy --strict bug2.py \r\nbug.py:1: error: Skipping analyzing \"diffusers\": module is installed, but missing library stubs or py.typed marker  [import]\r\nbug.py:1: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#missing-imports\r\nbug2.py:3: error: Module has no attribute \"StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline\"; maybe \"StableDiffusionPipeline\"?  [attr-defined]\r\nbug2.py:4: error: Module has no attribute \"StableDiffusionPipeline\"; maybe \"StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline\"?  [attr-defined]\r\nFound 3 errors in 2 files (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout `--strict`, the \"Skipping analyzing\" error is the only one produced. With `--ignore-missing-imports` or `# type: ignore[import]` for the `import` in bug.py, only the \"Module has no attribute\" errors are produced.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nMypy should\r\n\r\n1. Understand that the two attributes exist in the `bug` module;\r\n2. Even failing (1), not suggest options it thinks don't exist.\r\n\r\nSo I would expect the \"Skipping analyzing\" to be the only error message mypy outputs.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: `mypy 0.982 (compiled: yes)`\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: `--config-file= --strict`\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): None (`--config-file=`)\r\n- Python version used: 3.10.8\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip freeze\r\ncertifi==2022.9.24\r\ncharset-normalizer==2.1.1\r\ndiffusers==0.5.1\r\nfilelock==3.8.0\r\nhuggingface-hub==0.10.1\r\nidna==3.4\r\nimportlib-metadata==5.0.0\r\nmypy==0.982\r\nmypy-extensions==0.4.3\r\nnumpy==1.23.4\r\npackaging==21.3\r\nPillow==9.2.0\r\npyparsing==3.0.9\r\nPyYAML==6.0\r\nregex==2022.9.13\r\nrequests==2.28.1\r\ntomli==2.0.1\r\ntqdm==4.64.1\r\ntyping_extensions==4.4.0\r\nurllib3==1.26.12\r\nzipp==3.9.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- You can freely edit this text, please remove all the lines you believe are unnecessary. -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13908/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
