https://gitter.im/python/typing\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Bug Report**\r\n\r\nRunning mypy with `--strict` does not find an error which is found without `--strict` because the return type of a method is changed to `Any`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport cantools\r\n\r\nffn = 'test.dbc'\r\ndbc = cantools.database.load_file(ffn)\r\nassert isinstance(dbc, cantools.database.can.database.Database)\r\n\r\nreveal_type(dbc.decode_message)\r\n\r\nrawdata = b'ABCDEABC'\r\ndata = dbc.decode_message(0x123, rawdata)\r\nreveal_type(data)\r\nprint(data['voltage'])\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning mypy without --strict: The return type of `dbc.decode_message` is recognized correctly and an expected error message is printed for the last line.\r\n```bash\r\n$ mypy test.py \r\ntest.py:9: note: Revealed type is \"def (frame_id_or_name: Union[builtins.int, builtins.str], data: builtins.bytes, decode_choices: builtins.bool =, scaling: builtins.bool =, decode_containers: builtins.bool =, allow_truncated: builtins.bool =) -> Union[builtins.dict[builtins.str, Union[builtins.float, builtins.str,

`--strict`: The return type of `dbc.decode_message` is considered to be `Any` and because of that the error is not recognized.\r\n```bash\r\n$ mypy --strict test.py\r\ntest.py:9: note: Revealed type is \"def (frame_id_or_name: Union[builtins.int, builtins.str], data: builtins.bytes, decode_choices: builtins.bool =, scaling: builtins.bool =, decode_containers: builtins.bool =, allow_truncated:

behave? It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\nWrite down what you thought would happen. If you expected no errors, delete this section.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nmypy should detect the return type even when using `--strict` and print the same error message like without `--strict`.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n<!-- What went wrong? Paste mypy's output. -->\r\n\r\nmypy does not find the error.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n-
