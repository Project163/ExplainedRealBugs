I would expect no errors if the class is marked `@final` OR if `__init__` is marked `@final`. Or both, of course.\n\nI also think the first case, where I explicitly annotate the `B` types, should not be necessary. Because the class is `@final`, I would expect the second case using `Self` to be fine. Again, I included that just to show that the error is reported either way.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\n```text\nmain.py:17: error: Accessing \"__init__\" on an instance is unsound, since instance.__init__ could be from an incompatible subclass  [misc]\nmain.py:29: error: Accessing \"__init__\" on an instance is unsound, since instance.__init__ could be from an incompatible subclass  [misc]\n```\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n- Mypy version used: 1.15.0\n- Mypy command-line flags: None\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): None\n- Python version used: 3.13\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19033/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19033/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
