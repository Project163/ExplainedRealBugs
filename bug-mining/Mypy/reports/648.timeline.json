Summary\r\n\r\n<!-- What's the purpose of the change? What does it do, and why? -->\r\nThis PR extends our [PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695) handling from the type aliases handled by `UP040` to generic function and class parameters, as suggested in the latter two examples from #4617:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Input\r\nT = TypeVar(\"T\", bound=float)\r\nclass A(Generic[T]):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\ndef f(t: T):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n# Output\r\nclass A[T: float]:\r\n    ...\r\n\r\ndef f[T: float](t: T):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI first implemented this as part of `UP040`, but based on a brief discussion during a very helpful pairing session with @AlexWaygood, I opted to split them into rules separate from `UP040` and then also separate from each other. From a quick look, and based on [this issue](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade/issues/836), I'm pretty sure neither of these rules is currently in pyupgrade, so I just took the next available codes, `UP046` and `UP047`.\r\n\r\nThe last main TODO, noted in the rule file and in the fixture, is to handle generic method parameters not included in the class itself, `S` in this case:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\r\nS = TypeVar(\"S\")\r\n\r\nclass Foo(Generic[T]):\r\n    def bar(self, x: T, y: S) -> S: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut Alex mentioned that that might be okay to leave for a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nI also left a TODO about handling multiple subclasses instead of bailing out when more than one is present. I'm not sure how common that would be, but I can still handle it here, or follow up on that too.\r\n\r\nI think this is unrelated to the PR, but when I ran `cargo dev generate-all`, it removed the rule code `PLW0101` from `ruff.schema.json`. It seemed unrelated, so I left that out, but I wanted to mention it just in case.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nNew test fixture, `cargo nextest run`\r\n\r\nCloses #4617, closes #12542
