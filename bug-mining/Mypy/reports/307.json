Right now if you run `stubgen` on this code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom functools import cached_property\r\n\r\nclass A:\r\n    @cached_property\r\n    def x(self):\r\n        return 'x'\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will get:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass A:\r\n    def x(self): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is incorrect, because it turns a property into a method.\r\n\r\nBut, ideally you should get:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom functools import cached_property\r\n\r\nclass A:\r\n    @cached_property\r\n    def x(self): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI already have a working prototype of the solution.
