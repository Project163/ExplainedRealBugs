Description\r\n\r\nFixes #12930.\r\n\r\nCurrently, mypy erroneously emits two errors on this snippet:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing_extensions import ParamSpec\r\nfrom typing import Callable, TypeVar, Iterator, Iterable, Tuple\r\n\r\nP = ParamSpec(\"P\")\r\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\r\n\r\ndef enumerate(x: Iterable[T]) -> Iterator[Tuple[int, T]]: ...\r\n\r\ndef foo(func: Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[P, T]:\r\n    def _inner(*args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> T:\r\n        y = enumerate(args)  # E: Need type annotation for \"y\"  # E: Argument 1 to \"enumerate\" has incompatible type \"P.args\"; expected \"Iterable[<nothing>]\"\r\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n    return _inner\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because of a bug in `constraints.py`: `ParamSpecArgs` and `ParamSpecKwargs` have upper bounds following #12668 (`tuple[object, ...]` and `dict[str, object]` respectively), but the constraints solver isn't currently aware of that fact. This PR fixes that bug. \r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nI added a test to one of the existing test cases.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6742034409,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5K_zCEzwAAAAGR20fp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6742034409","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-06-04T15:27:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6742034447,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5K_zCEzwAAAAGR20gP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6742034447","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8153e47b45247c81ba9792ab46ab788513613f6b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/8153e47b45247c81ba9792ab46ab788513613f6b","created_at":"2022-06-04T15:27:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
