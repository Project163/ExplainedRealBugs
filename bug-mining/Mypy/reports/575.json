Report**\n\nType narrowing is not performed in a conditional containing a walrus operator if:\n- There is another conditional in the same statement (`if maybe and`), and\n- An attribute access is performed on the value of the walrus operator (`foo := Foo(True)).value`)\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\nhttps://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.13&flags=strict&gist=7e7edfa1d3debec48847590a6c4532c9\n\n```python\nclass Foo:\n    value: bool\n\n    def __init__(self, value: bool) -> None:\n        self.thing = value\n\n\ndef bad(maybe: bool) -> None:\n    foo = None\n    if maybe and (foo := Foo(True)).value:\n        reveal_type(foo)\n\n\ndef correct1(maybe: bool) -> None:\n    foo = None\n    if maybe and (foo := Foo(True)):\n        reveal_type(foo)\n\n\ndef correct2(maybe: bool) -> None:\n    foo = None\n    if maybe:\n        if (foo := Foo(True)).value:\n            reveal_type(foo)\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nThe revealed type is always `Foo`.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\n```\nmain.py:11: note: Revealed type is \"Union[__main__.Foo, None]\"\nmain.py:17: note: Revealed type is \"__main__.Foo\"\nmain.py:24: note: Revealed type is \"__main__.Foo\"\nSuccess: no issues found in 1 source file\n```\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n- Mypy version used: 1.15.0\n- Mypy command-line flags: `--strict`\n- Python version used: 3.13","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19036/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
