is questionable why `--strict` does not just enable `--warn-unreachable`. A lot of people probably think \"I'm running `--strict`, there's nothing else important to enable\".\r\n\r\n@sobolevn told me to create this issue in

would be more consistent with what we already do for ternary expressions. Note the change in match test results from match logic not handling well the situation when initial type is a union. A possible workaround would be to force \"collapsing\" union of tuples back into a tuple with union, but it is not easy and was planning to do some cleanup in the match handling as well (in particular it uses joins instead of unions in a way that will be inconsistent with new binder behavior). I want to put the switch from join to union for match statement in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nNote I also simplify a bunch of special-casing around `Any` in the binder that existed mostly because `join(Any, X) == Any`.\r\nFixes

#18386 (at least partly)\r\n\r\n(edited)\r\n\r\nIn a first test run, in which I included checks against `None` in  `--strict-equality`, the Mypy primer gave hundreds of new `comparison-overlap` reports.   Many of them seem really helpful (including those for the Mypy source code itself), because it is often hard to tell if non-overlapping `None` checks are just remnants of incomplete refactorings or can handle cases with corrupted data or similar issues.  As it was only a little effort, I decided to add the option `--strict-equality-for-none` to Mypy, which is disabled even in `--strict` mode.   Other libraries could adjust to this new behaviour if and when they want.  If many of them do so, we could eventually enable `--strict-equality-for-none` in `--strict` mode or even merge it with `--strict-equality` later.\r\n\r\nThe remaining new true positives revealed by the Mypy primer are the result of no longer excluding types with custom `__eq__` methods for identity checks (which, in my opinion, makes sense even in case `--strict-equality-for-none` would be rejected).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/3217447992","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/18386#issuecomment-3217447992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18386","id":3217447992,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc6_xlw4","user":{"login":"tyralla","id":25983587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTgzNTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25983587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyralla","html_url":"https://github.com/tyralla","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyralla/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyralla/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyralla/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyralla/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyralla/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyralla/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyralla/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyralla/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyralla/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-23T22:19:53Z","updated_at":"2025-08-23T22:19:53Z","body":"This recently confused me too, but in my case, `--warn-unreachable` fired but `--strict-equality` did not:\n\n```python\ng = 1\nif g is None:\n    y = 1  # error: Statement is unreachable\nprint(y)\n\ndef f() -> int:\n    return 1\nif f() is None:\n    x = 1\nprint(x)\n```\n\nRegarding `--warn-unreachable`, this really seems like a bug to me.  However, regarding `--strict-equality`, it is (or, at least, was) intentional.  See #6370 and here:\n\nhttps://github.com/python/mypy/blob/116b92bae7b5dbf5e6bd36fd9b0c6804973e5554/mypy/checkexpr.py#L3772-L3780\n\nI opened #19718 as an experiment.
