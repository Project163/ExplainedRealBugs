CHANGE: The `http_list` method will no longer\r\nignore the `iterator` argument if the `page` argument is not\r\nNone. The `ListMixin.list()` will now return either list or\r\niterator based on the `iterator` argument. This will make\r\ncertain type narrowing checks redundant.\r\n\r\nOverload `ListMixin.list` method typing to return either\r\n`RESTObjectList` or `list` based on the `iterator` argument.\r\nBy default then `iterator` is False return a list otherwise\r\nreturn an iterator.\r\n\r\nProvide 3 overloads:\r\n\r\n1. `iterator: Literal[False]` - this is the default and returns a list.\r\n2. `iterator: Literal[True]` - return an iterator.\r\n3. `iterator: bool` - return either list or iterator. It is useful when\r\n   the list function is being extended by another function that can\r\n   also take either True or False for the `iterator` argument.\r\n\r\nMake `page` argument to `http_list` not override the `iterator`\r\nto make the function signatures more straight forward. This\r\nalso makes it easier to unpack `**kwargs` as only `iterator`\r\nargument will control if a list or iterator is returned so the\r\n`**kwargs` can no longer have a hidden page argument.\r\n\r\n~~OLD~~\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n1. Should calling without `get_all` or `iterator` raise deprecation warning? (mypy needs a fix https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/18474)\r\n2. Is it `get_all` or `all`? Documentation still uses `all` but apparently it was replaced in favour of `get_all`?\r\n3. `**kwargs` are used for all options. Should at least some options become keyword arguments? This will improve code completion
