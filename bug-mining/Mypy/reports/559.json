They live side-by-side with the `.py` (if they exist). See e.g. https://github.com/numpy/numpy/tree/main/numpy.\n\n[NumType](https://github.com/numpy/numtype) is a static-typing project that we are developing. It comes with (different) [`numpy-stubs`](https://github.com/numpy/numtype/tree/main/src/numpy-stubs) stubs-only package for `numpy`. It is a backwards-incompatible rework of the stubs that are bundled with `numpy` containing experimental new features, and will therefore be opt-in (once released).\n\nIf both `numpy` and NumType's `numpy-stubs` are installed, PEP 561 states that `numpy-stubs` should take precedence over the ones from `numpy`. Mypy does this the other way around, effectively ignoring the new `numpy-stubs`.\n\nThis effectively means that we currently cannot support mypy. So I consider this to be a big problem. \n\nThe only workaround I was able find is to delete all `.pyi` in the local numpy installation directory. But this isn't something we can realistically ask of our users.\nSo if any other workarounds come to mind, please let me know :)\n\n\n## Repro-repo with additional details\n\nhttps://github.com/jorenham/mypy-pep561-numpy-issue.","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18997/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18997/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
