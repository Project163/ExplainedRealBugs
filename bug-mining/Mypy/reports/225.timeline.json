Report**\r\n\r\nRunning mypy on the current pydantic codebase (specifically the code as of https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic/pull/4735), give the following run times:\r\n\r\n* running `mypy pydantic` with mypy `0.982`, and no `.mypy_cache`: 8s\r\n* running `mypy pydantic` with mypy `0.982`, `.mypy_cache` present: 0.17s\r\n* running `mypy pydantic` with mypy `0.990`, and no `.mypy_cache`: 3m19s\r\n* running `mypy pydantic` with mypy `0.990`, `.mypy_cache` present: 3m6s\r\n\r\n(1000x comes from `(3 * 60 + 6) / 0.17`)\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few errors, mostly due to `no_implicit_optional=True`, but still - this seems like a significant regression.\r\n\r\nWhile mypy 0.990 is running, I see 100% usage on 1 CPU.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nShould be as simple as cloning pydantic, checkout that branch (`uprev-mypy`), install requirements from `requirements/linting.txt`, run mypy.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: `0.990`\r\n- Mypy
