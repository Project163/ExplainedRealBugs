an issue for tracking the current state of mypy on CPython 3.10\r\n\r\nCPython version: 3.10.0\r\nmypy version: latest master (https://github.com/python/mypy/commit/e6b91bdc5c253cefba940b0864a8257d833f0d8b)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies:\r\n- [x] typed_ast is currently broken. Fixed on master, but no release to pypi yet (https://github.com/python/typed_ast/pull/155)\r\n- [x] typed_ast again broken in 3.10.0a7. PR https://github.com/python/typed_ast/pull/158\r\n- [x] lxml is currently broken due to a cython bug. The bug has been fixed in cython 0.29.22, but lxml hasn't been built with the new version yet (https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/1904900)\r\n- [x] virtualenv  uses distutils, which is deprecated and will be removed in python 3.12. Mypy test-depends on `virtualenv<20`, and it looks like only virtualenv >=20 is still in active development. (https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10407)\r\n- [x] pytest breaks on python 3.10. This is already fixed upstream, but mypy pins pytest to <6.2, because of python 3.5 support\r\n\r\n### Tests:\r\n- [x] Some tests from FineGrainedSuite, FineGrainedCacheSuite and PythonCmdlineSuite` are broken, because cpython parser error messages changed. (https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/10404)\r\n    * Some occurrences of `error: invalid syntax` are now `error: expected ':'`\r\n    * Some occurrences of `error: unexpected EOF while parsing` are now `error: '(' was never closed`\r\n- [x] Tests from SamplesSuite break with `mypy/typeshed/stdlib/types.pyi:334: error: Name '_NotImplementedType' is not defined` (https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/5044)\r\n- [x] Enable CI for python 3.10  (#11294)\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- [x] Pattern matching\r\n  - [x] Pattern matching is not yet supported (#10191)\r\n  - [x] Exhaustiveness checking for pattern matching (#12010)\r\n  - [ ] Pattern matching in mypyc (https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc/issues/911)\r\n- [x] Support explicit TypeAlias (#9404)\r\n- [x] Support PEP 604 syntax for runtime use cases (#9880)\r\n    - [x]  PEP 604 for TypeVar bounds #10949\r\n- [x] Support for dataclasses' kw_only (#10867)\r\n- [ ] Support PEP 612 Parameter Specification Variables (#8645)\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n- [x] mypyc is broken, because `_PyObject_HasAttrId` has been removed from CPython (https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/22629). PR #10202.\r\n- [x] mypy/sitepkgs.py imports `distutils`, which is deprecated and will be removed in python 3.12 (#10203).\r\n\r\n### Misc\r\n- [x] Build Python 3.10 wheels\r\n- [x] Add Python 3.10
