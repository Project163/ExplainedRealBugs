#16550\n\nImprove hashability detection for attrs classes.\n\nI added a new parameter to `add_attribute_to_class`, `overwrite_existing`, since I needed it.\n\nFrozen classes remain hashable, non-frozen default to no. This can be overriden by passing in `hash=True` or `unsafe_hash=True` (new parameter, added to stubs) to `define()`.\n\nInheritance-wise I think we're correct, if a non-hashable class inherits from a hashable one, it's still unhashable at runtime.\n\nAccompanying tests.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16556/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11228175928,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc53vkVrzwAAAAKdQF44","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/11228175928","actor":{"login":"sobolevn","id":4660275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjAyNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4660275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn","html_url":"https://github.com/sobolevn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-12-12T20:08:15Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11228176072,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc53vkVrzwAAAAKdQF7I","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/11228176072","actor":{"login":"sobolevn","id":4660275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjAyNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4660275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn","html_url":"https://github.com/sobolevn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"91be28552e062601adc2a07075263994c102d5cc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/91be28552e062601adc2a07075263994c102d5cc","created_at":"2023-12-12T20:08:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
