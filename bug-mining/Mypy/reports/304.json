Report**\r\n\r\nWhen using `typing.overload` with an async function that returns an `AsyncGenerator` or `AsyncIterable`, the overloads fail with `Overloaded function implementation cannot produce return type of signature #` when defined using `async def`\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nFailure case: https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.11&gist=f9b64edbf09acd4b1952f5753669c2e7\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import AsyncGenerator, overload\r\n\r\n@overload\r\nasync def foo(*, a: int) -> AsyncGenerator[int, None]:\r\n    ...\r\n    \r\n@overload\r\nasync def foo(*, b: int) -> AsyncGenerator[int, None]:\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nasync def foo(*, a: int | None = None, b: int | None = None) -> AsyncGenerator[int, None]:\r\n    if a is not None:\r\n        for i in range(a):\r\n            yield i\r\n    elif b is not None:\r\n        for i in range(b):\r\n            yield i\r\n    else:\r\n        yield -1\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnexpected success case: https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.11&gist=2fcc9c2372664f4ce257a9cec2849698\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import AsyncGenerator, overload\r\n\r\n@overload\r\ndef foo(*, a: int) -> AsyncGenerator[int, None]:\r\n    ...\r\n    \r\n@overload\r\ndef foo(*, b: int) -> AsyncGenerator[int, None]:\r\n

error when overloads are defined with `def`\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nwhen overloads are defined with `async def`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmain.py:11: error: Overloaded function implementation cannot produce return type of signature 1  [misc]\r\nmain.py:11: error: Overloaded function implementation cannot produce return type of signature 2  [misc]\r\nFound 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen overloads are defined with `def`: no errors\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 1.1.1 (mypy-play)\r\n- Python version used: 3.11 (mypy-play)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14996/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14996/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
