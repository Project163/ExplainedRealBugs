#19269\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the logic implemented in #19118 (which only targeted repeatedly checked loops) and applies it to repeatedly checked finally clauses.\r\n\r\nI moved nearly all relevant code to the class `LoopErrorWatcher`, which now has the more general name `IterationErrorWatcher`, to avoid code duplication.  However, one duplication is left, which concerns error reporting.   It would be nice and easy to move this functionality to `IterationErrorWatcher`, too, but this would result in import cycles, and I am unsure if working with `TYPE_CHECKING` and postponed importing is acceptable in such cases (both for Mypy and Mypyc). \r\n\r\nAfter the refactoring, it should not be much effort to apply the logic to other cases where code sections are analysed iteratively.   However, the only thing that comes to my mind is the repeated checking of functions with arguments that contain constrained type variables.  I will check it.  If anyone finds a similar case and the solution is as simple as expected, we could add the fix to this PR, of course.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19270/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19270/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18082930659,"node_id":"LE_lADOAGuhRc66zMQgzwAAAAQ105_j","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/18082930659","actor":{"login":"A5rocks","id":40616000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjE2MDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40616000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/A5rocks","html_url":"https://github.com/A5rocks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/A5rocks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/A5rocks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/A5rocks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/A5rocks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/A5rocks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/A5rocks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/A5rocks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/A5rocks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/A5rocks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-10T21:15:29Z","label":{"name":"topic-reachability","color":"2EC6A6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18250149276,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc66zMQgzwAAAAQ_yy2c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/18250149276","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-20T15:48:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18250149304,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc66zMQgzwAAAAQ_yy24","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/18250149304","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4322d4f443ef7568b1c0f4fec8df9e12e90fd8b9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/4322d4f443ef7568b1c0f4fec8df9e12e90fd8b9","created_at":"2025-06-20T15:48:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18570927871,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc66zMQgzwAAAARS6d7_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/18570927871","actor":{"login":"esarp","id":11684270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjg0Mjcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11684270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/esarp","html_url":"https://github.com/esarp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esarp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esarp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esarp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esarp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esarp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esarp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esarp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/esarp/events
