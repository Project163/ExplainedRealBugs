In both branches of the if statement, the type of `x` still contains `EllipsisType` instead of being narrowed.\r\n\r\nThis narrowed as expected in 1.8.0.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, it appears that `if instanceof(x, EllipsisType)` still works as expected.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nRun mypy against the following snippet:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom types import EllipsisType\r\n\r\nx: int | EllipsisType\r\n\r\nif x is ...:\r\n    pass\r\nelse:\r\n    y = x + 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nA more complicated reproduction of this issue can be seen in our repo here: https://github.com/lsst/daf_butler/actions/runs/8209898890/job/22456322445?pr=973\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nmypy 1.8.0 shows no errors because `x` was narrowed to `int` in the else clause:\r\n```\r\nSuccess: no issues found in 1 source file\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\nmypy 1.9.0 reports an error instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntmp.py:8: error: Unsupported operand types for + (\"EllipsisType\" and \"int\")  [operator]\r\ntmp.py:8: note: Left operand is of type \"int | EllipsisType\"\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 1.9.0\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: none\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): none\r\n- Python version used: 3.11.7\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17002/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17002/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
