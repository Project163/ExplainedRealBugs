I would not be surprised if this is a duplicate though.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom collections.abc import Callable\r\n\r\ndef faulty(c: Callable[[int], None]) -> Callable[[tuple[int, int]], None]:\r\n    return lambda x: None\r\n    \r\n@faulty  # 2 errors reported here\r\n@faulty\r\ndef f(x: str) -> None:\r\n    return None\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterestingly, if `faulty` returns `Callable[[str], None]` this only reports 1 error. I assume this is an artifact of error deduplication.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nHow did you expect mypy to behave?
