Report**\r\n\r\nIn a `match` statement in which all `case`s include a return statement, _mypy_ 0.942 falsely reports \"Missing return statement [return]\" if at least one `case` includes a guard clause.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef func(e) -> int:\r\n    match e:\r\n        case x if True:\r\n            return x\r\n        case _:\r\n            return 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr even more simply:\r\n```\r\ndef func(e) -> int:\r\n    match e:\r\n        case _ if True:\r\n            return 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nThis code should type-check.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mypy --python-version 3.10 --show-error-codes x5.py\r\nx5.py:1: error: Missing return statement  [return]\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nIf we change the first case to something that does not include a guard clause, like this:\r\n```\r\ndef func(e) -> int:\r\n    match e:\r\n        case (x, _):\r\n            return x\r\n        case _:\r\n            return 0\r\n```\r\nthen _mypy_ returns no errors.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 0.942\r\n- Mypy command-line flags:  --python-version 3.10 --show-error-codes\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): (none)\r\n- Python version used: 3.10.2\r\n- Operating system and version: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12534/reactions","total_count":20,"+1":19,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12534/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
