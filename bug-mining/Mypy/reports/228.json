Typically, once I get the files I'm typing in better shape, the error goes away.   But to get there my process is greatly slowed by dmypy crashing on every non-initial run making it mostly not useful compared to running plain mypy.\r\n\r\nreproduction steps follow below.   the crash is:\r\n\r\n\r\n```py\r\n$ dmypy  check lib\r\nDaemon crashed!\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"mypy/dmypy_server.py\", line 230, in serve\r\n  File \"mypy/dmypy_server.py\", line 273, in run_command\r\n  File \"mypy/dmypy_server.py\", line 341, in cmd_check\r\n  File \"mypy/dmypy_server.py\", line 394, in check\r\n  File \"mypy/dmypy_server.py\", line 569, in fine_grained_increment_follow_imports\r\n  File \"mypy/server/update.py\", line 245, in update\r\n  File \"mypy/server/update.py\", line 328, in update_one\r\n  File \"mypy/server/update.py\", line 393, in update_module\r\n  File \"mypy/server/update.py\", line 615, in update_module_isolated\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 2192, in type_check_first_pass\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 319, in check_first_pass\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 427, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/errors.py\", line 902, in report_internal_error\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 425, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 1021, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 1810, in visit_class_def\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 427, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/errors.py\", line 902, in report_internal_error\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 425, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 1092, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 2174, in visit_block\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 427, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/errors.py\", line 902, in report_internal_error\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 425, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 740, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 776, in visit_func_def\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 780, in _visit_func_def\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 842, in check_func_item\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 1027, in check_func_def\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 427, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/errors.py\", line 902, in report_internal_error\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 425, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 1092, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 2174, in visit_block\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 427, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/errors.py\", line 902, in report_internal_error\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 425, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 1316, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/checker.py\", line 3581, in visit_if_stmt\r\n  File \"mypy/checkexpr.py\", line 3983, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/errors.py\", line 902, in report_internal_error\r\n  File \"mypy/checkexpr.py\", line 3981, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 1897, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/checkexpr.py\", line 2244, in visit_comparison_expr\r\n  File \"mypy/checkexpr.py\", line 3983, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/errors.py\", line 902, in report_internal_error\r\n  File \"mypy/checkexpr.py\", line 3981, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 1653, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/checkexpr.py\", line 197, in visit_name_expr\r\n  File \"mypy/checkexpr.py\", line 224, in analyze_ref_expr\r\n  File \"mypy/checkmember.py\", line 969, in type_object_type\r\nValueError: value is not in list\r\n```\r\n\r\nsteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. using Python 3.10.0 in case that's important\r\n2. dmypy 0.950 - this is a straight install from pypi, though ive had the issue in the past running from a source install also \r\n3. git clone SQLAlchemy from gerrit and cd into new directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://gerrit.sqlalchemy.org/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy\r\n$ cd sqlalchemy\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. download a specific patch that is reproducing the issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git fetch https://gerrit.sqlalchemy.org/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy refs/changes/25/3825/2 && git checkout FETCH_HEAD\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. start dmypy and run an initial check against lib.  there's about 50 typing errors generated as expected\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dmypy start\r\n$ dmypy check lib\r\n... output follows ...\r\nFound 50 errors in 1 file (checked 700 source files)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. make any change, like adding a blank line, to lib/sqlalchemy/orm/decl_api.py:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ printf \"\\n\" >> lib/sqlalchemy/orm/decl_api.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. run \"dmypy recheck\".  crash\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dympy recheck\r\n\r\n... stack trace...\r\n  File \"mypy/checkexpr.py\", line 197, in visit_name_expr\r\n  File \"mypy/checkexpr.py\", line 224, in analyze_ref_expr\r\n  File \"mypy/checkmember.py\", line 969, in type_object_type\r\nValueError: value is not in list\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm able to reproduce this from running the steps above in a brand new directory.\r\n\r\nI fully expect there is something in my code making it do this which I am sure is some horrible mistake I'm making, however, dmypy should tell me what the mistake is rather than crashing.
