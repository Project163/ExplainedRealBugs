for the reduced repro! I can reproduce this on master. The necessary elements seems to be \r\n1. setting `follow_imports = skip` for `importlib`. This causes the semantic analyzer to defer on every (non-final) pass due to `importlib.machinery.ModuleSpec` being missing. There's already logic in place to fall back to `builtins.object` on the final pass; however the final pass is never reached (see below).\r\n2. a NamedTuple with a function definition. In this case, a new symbol table node is created for the function on every pass, causing the semantic analyzer to always \"make progress\". Since it makes progress on every pass, the final iteration is never reached.\r\n\r\nThe result is that the semantic analyzer always defers due to (1) and always makes progress due to (2). This leads to an infinite number of passes (until the max iteration logic kicks in).\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2517827823/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brianschubert","id":25313350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzEzMzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25313350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert","html_url":"https://github.com/brianschubert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15528661197,"node_id":"LE_lADOAGuhRc6h4X09zwAAAAOdlJDN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/15528661197","actor":{"login":"brianschubert","id":25313350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzEzMzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25313350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert","html_url":"https://github.com/brianschubert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brianschubert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-04T15:46:11Z","label":{"name":"semantic-analyzer","color":"011890"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sterliakov","id":50529348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTI5MzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50529348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov","html_url":"https://github.com/sterliakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-11-02T14:58:04Z","updated_at":"2025-11-02T14:58:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/20167","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/20167/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/20167/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/20167/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/20167","id":3579624731,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGuhRc6xEG6B","number":20167,"title":"Use
