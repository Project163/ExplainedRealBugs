#10604\r\n\r\nThis adds support for marking test cases in *.test files as [xfails](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/skipping.html#xfail-mark-test-functions-as-expected-to-fail) by adding `-xfail` to the end of the test case name.\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure if I should turn on [`xfail_strict`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/skipping.html#strict-parameter) in the pytest config. Turning that on would probably make it less likely that we would end up with tests that are still marked as xfails long after they're fixed, but it might be annoying have the test suite fail because a test marked as xfail started passing.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nI couldn't find a way to write tests for this change, so I changed some existing tests by marking them as xfail and made sure they were treated as xfails when they failed, and xpasses when they succeeded.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10635/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4882541029,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDg4MjU0MTAyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/4882541029","actor":{"login":"msullivan","id":340349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDM0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan","html_url":"https://github.com/msullivan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-06-13T18:22:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4882541066,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ4ODI1NDEwNjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/4882541066","actor":{"login":"msullivan","id":340349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDM0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan","html_url":"https://github.com/msullivan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fe157d40cf11c5bd6398fe0bef99c8844ed3aedf","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/fe157d40cf11c5bd6398fe0bef99c8844ed3aedf","created_at":"2021-06-13T18:22:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
