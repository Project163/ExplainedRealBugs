got a little scared off from working on this by the many other enthusiastic people volunteering their time in #8373. However, there doesn't seem to have been much progress; since I have some extra time now, I figured sharing what I've got could kickstart things. Apologies if someone — or whatever a GSoC is — is already working on it :-) Branch is visible at https://github.com/hauntsaninja/mypy/tree/pep612, happy to make it a draft PR if that would help anything.\r\n\r\nOverall seems like the plan would be: \r\n- Focus on generic functions first, implement generic class support later, as pyre plans to. \r\n- Make the fairly straight forward changes in semanal.py and nodes.py so you have the AST. Make relevant visitors visit it (look at where we visit_type_var_expr).\r\n- Change typeanal.py, tvar_scope.py, etc to get binding going to the types you create in types.py. Seems like this would be the place to enforce valid use location too.\r\n- Implement the semantics of ParameterSpecification in checkexpr.py, infer.py, solve.py, etc.\r\n- Add a runtime implementation to mypy_extensions\r\n\r\nSince ParameterSpecification is just a juiced up type variable, it makes sense to try and re-use existing logic for TypeVar as much as possible (especially if later PEPs make use of the bounds and variance arguments that PEP 612 reserves). In my branch, I've chosen to add a base class TypeVarLikeX in a couple different class hierarchies, e.g. TypeVarLikeExpr, TypeVarLikeDef. Since I'm not super familiar with mypy's code, this also helps me stumble upon things that I might need to change (it feels great trusting mypy to help improve mypy!). But this is a fairly large refactor (the one-line change in the details snippet alone will require changes in a dozen files), and could maybe affect like plugins or something, so I thought I'd post this before exploring further.\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```\r\n--- a/mypy/types.py\r\n+++ b/mypy/types.py\r\n@@ -983,7 +983,7 @@ class CallableType(FunctionLike):\r\n                  fallback: Instance,\r\n                  name: Optional[str] = None,\r\n                  definition: Optional[SymbolNode] = None,\r\n-                 variables: Optional[List[TypeVarDef]] = None,\r\n+                 variables: Optional[Sequence[TypeVarLikeDef]] = None,\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI'm also a little worried about issues like #1317 and #5738. I don't yet know the code well enough to anticipate what issues we might run into, but I'd welcome any thoughts on interactions between existing TypeVar code and any PEP 612 implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/8645/reactions","total_count":37,"+1":20,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":5,"confused":0,"heart":12,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/8645/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6270304777,"node_id":"LE_lADOAGuhRc5F_w-ezwAAAAF1vUIJ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6270304777","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-19T20:02:34Z","label":{"name":"topic-paramspec","color":"CA9FD9"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"AlexWaygood","id":66076021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDc2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66076021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexWaygood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-24T02:06:15Z","updated_at":"2022-04-24T02:06:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12660","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12660/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12660/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12660/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12660","id":1213352772,"node_id":"I_kwDOAGuhRc5IUktE","number":12660,"title":"ParamSpec

#12386\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMypy currently thinks that a variable annotated with `P.args` is not iterable, and thinks that a variable annotated with `P.kwargs` does not have a `.pop()` method:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Callable\r\nfrom typing_extensions import ParamSpec\r\n\r\nP = ParamSpec('P')\r\n\r\ndef func(callback: Callable[P, str]) -> Callable[P, str]:\r\n    def inner(*args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> str:\r\n        for a in args:  # E: \"P.args\" has no attribute \"__iter__\" (not iterable)\r\n            pass\r\n        b = 'foo' in args    # E: \"P.args\" has no attribute \"__iter__\" (not iterable)\r\n        print(args.count(42))  # E: \"P.args\" has no attribute \"count\"\r\n        print(len(args))  # E: Argument 1 to \"len\" has

     kwargs.pop('bar')  # E: \"P.kwargs\" has no attribute \"pop\"\r\n        return 'baz'\r\n    return inner\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we use `tuple[Any, ...]` as the upper bound of `ParamSpec.args`, and `dict[str, Any]` as the upper bound of `ParamSpec.kwargs`, all these false-positive errors go away.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nExisting tests have been updated, and a test case has been added.\r\n\r\nTo avoid repetition among the `ParamSpec` test cases, I've added a new `builtins` fixture, `paramspec.pyi`, which basically combines `tuple.pyi` and `dict.pyi`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12668/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12668/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6524436853,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5F_w-ezwAAAAGE4wF1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6524436853","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-29T15:41:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6524437097,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5F_w-ezwAAAAGE4wJp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6524437097","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c6cf7cd3dac90dce0be5bf888f530f2eee1534e7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/c6cf7cd3dac90dce0be5bf888f530f2eee1534e7","created_at":"2022-04-29T15:41:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"kasium","id":15907922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA3OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15907922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasium","html_url":"https://github.com/kasium","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasium/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasium/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasium/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasium/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasium/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasium/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasium/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasium/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasium/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-02T14:07:23Z","updated_at":"2022-06-02T14:07:23Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12930","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12930/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12930/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12930/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12930","id":1258238084,"node_id":"I_kwDOAGuhRc5K_zCE","number":12930,"title":"ParamspecArgs
