you're not sure whether what you're experiencing is a mypy bug, please see the \"Question and Help\" form instead.\nPlease consider:\n\n- checking our common issues page: https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html\n- searching our issue tracker: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues to see if it's already been reported\n- asking on gitter chat: https://gitter.im/python/typing\n-->\n\n**Bug Report**\n\n<!--\nIf you're reporting a problem with a specific library function, the typeshed tracker is better suited for this report: https://github.com/python/typeshed/issues\n\nIf the project you encountered the issue in is open source, please provide a link to the project.\n-->\n\nI think this may be a possible refinement bug. Mypy flags an error on the assignment line, and not the return statement. So it is clear Mypy flags `{}` as a subtype of `{str, str}`, but I think this should be one of those cases where having refinements should reduce the annotation burden on developers. Unless we want to throw an error because of imprecision.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n```python\n# Ideally, a small sample program that demonstrates the problem.\n# Or even better, a reproducible playground link https://mypy-play.net/ (use the \"Gist\" button)\ndef func() -> dict[str, str]: \n    x = {} ## error here for annot \n    return x\n\n```\nreproducible link: [Gist](https://gist.github.com/mypy-play/2490355957c6c7f648a9c1e28f0b052f) [Playground](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.11&flags=strict&gist=91ed08fb568f6deac70cb326a87bcc6b)\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nI would expect Mypy to notice the reveal_type(x) as dict[str, str] based off the functions return type and not raise an error.\n<!--\nHow did you expect mypy to behave? It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\nWrite down what you thought would happen. If you expected no errors, delete this section.\n-->\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\n```\nmain.py:2: error: Need type annotation for \"x\" (hint: \"x: dict[<type>, <type>] = ...\")  [var-annotated]\n```\n\n<!-- What went wrong? Paste mypy's output. -->\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\n\n- Mypy version used:\n- Mypy command-line flags:\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files):\n- Python version used:\n\n<!-- You can freely edit this text, please remove all the lines you believe are unnecessary.

#18692. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes mypy recognize old-style aliases to TypedDict types:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nAlias = SomeTypedDict\r\nExplicitAlias: TypeAlias = SomeTypedDict\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill doesn't support generic no_args aliases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Generic, TypedDict, TypeVar\r\n\r\n_T = TypeVar(\"_T\")\r\n\r\nclass TD(TypedDict, Generic[_T]):\r\n    foo: _T\r\n\r\nAlias = TD\r\n# but works with\r\nOtherAlias = TD[_T]\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat's because `no_args` aliases are handled in code in several places and all of them expect such an alias to have `Instance`
