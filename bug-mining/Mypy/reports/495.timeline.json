several other tests.\r\n\r\nThe tests that I've updated have unearthed a couple of bugs related to column numbers(#12272, #12271, and #12274).

mentioned).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12269/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6270066044,"node_id":"LE_lADOAGuhRc5E9_wOzwAAAAF1uZ18","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6270066044","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-19T15:51:27Z","label":{"name":"topic-paramspec","color":"CA9FD9"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6270066045,"node_id":"LE_lADOAGuhRc5E9_wOzwAAAAF1uZ19","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6270066045","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-19T15:51:27Z","label":{"name":"topic-error-reporting","color":"A8F9AF"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1374706480","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12274#issuecomment-1374706480","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12274","id":1374706480,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5R8Fsw","user":{"login":"KotlinIsland","id":65446343,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDQ2MzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65446343?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland","html_url":"https://github.com/KotlinIsland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-08T04:33:22Z","updated_at":"2023-01-08T04:35:05Z","body":"This
