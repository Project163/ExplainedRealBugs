wider return type can be useful if a decorator gets a more precise error type as part of a typeshed update.\r\n\r\n@wrobell reported this concrete example in

...\r\n\r\n@asynccontextmanager\r\nasync def f(cls=int):\r\n    yield 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nMypy 0.940 got a more precise type for `@asynccontextmanager`, and this resulted in apparent false positives:\r\n```\r\ntp.py:14: error: Overloaded function implementation cannot produce return type of signature 1\r\ntp.py:14: error: Overloaded function implementation cannot produce return type of signature 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that we can allow an overload item to have a more general return type than the implementation, for convenience.","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
