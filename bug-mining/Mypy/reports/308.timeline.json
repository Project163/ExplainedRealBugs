Report**\r\n\r\nThe standard library's `enum.Enum` has a class method<sup>†</sup> `__call__` that can take a member of the enumeration, or a member's value, and returns that member in either case.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to override the enumeration's `__init__`. The Python docs show [an example that uses this to attach additional data to the members](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/enum.html#planet).\r\n\r\nIf this is done, mypy reports an error when calling the class, expecting the call to follow the signature of `__init__`.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n[Playground](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.12&gist=c482b41e509b3910c29ad729e330a915)\r\n\r\nThis is a stripped-down example of the one from the Python docs. It runs successfully (the asserts pass).\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom enum import Enum\r\n\r\nclass Planet(Enum):\r\n    MERCURY = (3.303e+23, 2.4397e6)\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, mass: float, radius: float) -> None:\r\n        self.mass = mass\r\n        self.radius = radius\r\n\r\nmercury = Planet(Planet.MERCURY)\r\nassert mercury is Planet.MERCURY\r\n\r\nmercury = Planet((3.303e+23, 2.4397e6))\r\nassert mercury is Planet.MERCURY\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nOne possibility, of course, would be for mypy to produce no errors. But this *is* a somewhat odd situation, so failing that, there should be a way<sup>‡</sup> to signal to mypy that this is what's happening.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find any such way, short of `# type: ignore`. Overriding and annotating `__call__` didn't work:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def __call__(cls, value_or_member: Planet | tuple[float, float]) -> Planet:\r\n        return type(Enum).__call__(cls, value_or_member)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis definition type-checks fine, but it doesn't affect the previous errors. (It's worth noting that this doesn't seem to actually *override* anything; the calls bypass it and go for the metaclass.)\r\n\r\nIt *is* possibly to go the other way and adapt the code to suit mypy, by making the use of `__call__` explicit. This type-checks fine:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmercury = Planet.__call__(Planet.MERCURY)\r\nassert mercury is Planet.MERCURY\r\n\r\nmercury = Planet.__call__((3.303e+23, 2.4397e6))\r\nassert mercury is Planet.MERCURY\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that seems backwards to me.\r\n\r\nSearching for existing issues or Q&As didn't turn up anything that looked like it matched. There are some issues related to the functional API (e.g. #10469, a dupe of #6037), which also uses `__call__`, but [mypy specifically supports that](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/2306). There's also #15024, but that appears to be about `__call__` on an *instance*.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n```\r\nmain.py:10: error: Missing positional argument \"radius\" in call to \"Planet\"  [call-arg]\r\nmain.py:10: error: Argument 1 to \"Planet\" has incompatible type \"Planet\"; expected \"float\"  [arg-type]\r\nmain.py:13: error: Missing positional argument \"radius\" in call to \"Planet\"  [call-arg]\r\nmain.py:13: error: Argument 1 to \"Planet\" has incompatible type \"tuple[float, float]\"; expected \"float\"  [arg-type]\r\nFound 4 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 0.982 locally, latest on playground\r\n- Mypy command-line flags and config options: none\r\n- Python version used: 3.11.6 locally, 3.12 on playground\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<sup>†</sup> Technically it's [implemented on the metaclass](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.12/Lib/enum.py#L713) rather than by `@classmethod`.\r\n\r\n<sup>‡</sup> Preferably something obvious, to be [PEP 20](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)-compliant. :wink: (\"There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\" Maybe the problem is that I'm not Dutch?)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16712/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16712/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
