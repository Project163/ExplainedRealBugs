Please [find it here](https://github.com/tk-woven/mypy-install-types-mre).\r\n\r\nI summarize the example below.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nFor the source tree\r\n\r\n```\r\n.\r\n├── a\r\n│   └── lib.py\r\n├── b\r\n│   └── lib.py\r\n└── main.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere _all files are empty_ except `main.py`, which might contain\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef f(i: int = 0):\r\n    i = \"test\"  # This is a mypy violation.\r\n    print(i)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    f()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe expect running `mypy --install-types --non-interactive ./` at the root of the source tree to either (1) generate the `.mypy_cache` and then report any typing errors or (2) explain why it cannot generate the cache.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nmypy fails because `b.lib` duplicates `a.lib` by name in the same module. However, mypy does not report the duplicate module error. Instead, it only reports `error: --install-types failed (no mypy cache directory)`.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is particularly confusing in CI, where our environment has no preexisting `.mypy_cache` and where an unsuspecting user may accidentally cause the duplicate-module behavior. mypy fails and suggests it's because of the missing cache directory.\r\n\r\n(Deeper demonstration is in the reproducible example linked above. In short, if mypy finds an empty `.mypy_cache` folder, it will report the duplicate module issue. If we place `__init__.py` in `a` and `b` and remove `.mypy_cache`, mypy will install the cache correctly and report the typing error.)\r\n\r\n**My Environment**\r\n\r\n- Ubuntu 20\r\n- Python 3.6 (this older version is from the production codebase in which we found this issue)\r\n- mypy 0.910\r\n\r\nRelated to #10600 .","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10768/reactions","total_count":23,"+1":23,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10768/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
