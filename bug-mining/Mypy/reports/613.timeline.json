If this pull request fixes an issue, add \"Fixes #NNN\" with the issue number. -->\r\nFixes #19507\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a check to prevent reassignment of final variables in a match statement.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the following passes without an error:\r\n```Python\r\nfrom typing import Final\r\nFOO: Final = 8\r\n\r\na = 10\r\n\r\nmatch a:\r\n    case FOO:\r\n        pass\r\nprint(FOO)  # FOO is reassigned, prints 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nMyPy already checks that the type of FOO isn't changed if used like this. I added a check in the same place that makes sure it's not `Final` either.\r\n\r\nSince this tests the match syntax, I put the test where I did. If it's not the appropriate place for it I will move it as instructed :)\r\n<!--\r\nChecklist:\r\n- Read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n-
