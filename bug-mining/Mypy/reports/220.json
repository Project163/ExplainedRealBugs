To confirm, I reverted to `0.982` and configured then `enable_recursive_aliases = true` and confirmed that this also produces a segmentation fault. \r\n\r\n[This is the recursive type](https://github.com/mit-ll-responsible-ai/hydra-zen/blob/c6f45821cb26539308c8bf8db01f32aaae9d2cbb/src/hydra_zen/typing/_implementations.py#L200-L229) that is creating the issue. Oddly, when I specifically remove `Sequence[\"SupportedPrimitive\"]` from the union (comment out line 223), the issue goes away. I spent time trying to further isolate the culprit and create a minimal example, but I was unable to decouple the issue from hydra_zen. \r\n\r\n**Traceback**\r\n\r\n```\r\nSegmentation fault\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```\r\nrsokl@Maxwell:/tmp$ pip install hydra-zen==0.8.0 mypy==0.990\r\nrsokl@Maxwell:/tmp$ echo \"import hydra_zen\" > foo.py\r\nrsokl@Maxwell:/tmp/hydra-zen$ mypy foo.py\r\nSegmentation fault\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: `0.990`\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: (None)\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): (None)\r\n- Python version used:  `python-3.9.13-haa1d7c7_2`\r\n- Operating system and version:  Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.10.102.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 x86_64)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nYou can freely edit this text, please remove all the lines\r\nyou believe are unnecessary.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14031/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14031/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
