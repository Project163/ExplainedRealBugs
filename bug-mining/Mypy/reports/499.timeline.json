🐛 Describe the bug\n\nError normally looks like:\n```\n >>> General linter failure:\n\nError (MYPY) command-failed\nDaemon is stuck; consider /opt/conda/envs/py_3.9/bin/dmypy kill\n```\n\nthough there's been at least one variation with the message:\n```\n>>> General linter failure:\n\n  Error (MYPYSTRICT) command-failed\n    Response: {'restart': 'configuration changed', 'platform':
