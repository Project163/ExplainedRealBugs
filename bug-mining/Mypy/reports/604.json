No matter what, a decorator of the shape `@something.setter` is treated as a setter of the preceding `@property` - irrespective of what `something` is.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n```python\nclass Demo:\n    @property\n    def foo(self) -> int:\n        return 0\n    \n    @certainly_not_a_foo_what_is_this_at_all.setter\n    def foo(self, _: int) -> None:\n        ...\n\n\nd = Demo()\nreveal_type(d.foo)  # N: Revealed type is \"builtins.int\"\nd.foo = 0\nd.foo = ''  # E: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"str\", variable has type \"int\")  [assignment]\n```\n\nhttps://mypy-play.net/?mypy=master&python=3.12&flags=strict&gist=92b58f4d15da129a921ab39d8c0548cf\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nSay that the long name is not defined.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\nSee inline comments - that thing is still treated as `foo` setter.\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n- Mypy version used: master\n- Mypy command-line flags: N/A\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): N/A\n- Python version used: 3.12\n","closed_by":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
