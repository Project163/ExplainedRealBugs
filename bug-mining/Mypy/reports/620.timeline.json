Report**\r\n\r\nmypy behaves weirdly when narrowing type on an enum that has an `__init__` (as described in [the enum doc](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/enum.html#planet)), whereas it succeeds with \"regular\" enums.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. create an enum with `__init__` (this is the example of the enum doc) :\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Planet(Enum):\r\n    MERCURY = (3.303e+23, 2.4397e6)\r\n    VENUS = (4.869e+24, 6.0518e6)\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, mass, radius):\r\n        self.mass = mass\r\n        self.radius = radius\r\n\r\n    @property\r\n    def surface_gravity(self) -> float:\r\n        G = 6.67300E-11\r\n        return G * self.mass / (self.radius * self.radius)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. narrow such an enum : \r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef get_gravity(x: Planet) -> float:\r\n    reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is 'main.Planet'\r\n    if x is Planet.MERCURY:\r\n        reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is 'Literal[main.Planet.MERCURY]'\r\n        return 0.0\r\n\r\n   # the alleged bug is in the line below, as I expected :Revealed type is 'Literal[main.Planet.VENUS]'\r\n    reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is 'Union[Literal[main.Planet.VENUS], Literal[main.Planet.mass], Literal[main.Planet.radius]]'\r\n    return x.surface_gravity\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nI'd have expected the same behaviour as with a \"regular\" enum :\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Planet(Enum):\r\n    MERCURY = auto()\r\n    VENUS = auto()\r\n\r\n\r\ndef get_gravity(x: Planet) -> float:\r\n    reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is 'main.Planet'\r\n    if x is Planet.MERCURY:\r\n        reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is 'Literal[main.Planet.MERCURY]'\r\n        return 0.0\r\n\r\n    # here, the revealed type is as expected :\r\n    reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is 'Literal[main.Planet.VENUS]'\r\n    return 1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nRevealed type after the narrowing weirdly includes the attributes.\r\n\r\nNote : as the problem seems to be related to how `self` is handled, maybe it is related to [this issue](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11368), even if the situation is quite different ?\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: `0.800`\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: None\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` : None\r\n- Python version used: `3.8.10`\r\n- Operating system and
