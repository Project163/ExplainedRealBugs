This previously worked up to MyPy 1.11 and PyRight was/is happy with it. However, since version 1.12 MyPy no longer matches the overload and completely loses type information; the `Possible overload variant` suggested is the least suitable.\r\n\r\nI initially [was notified about this](https://github.com/maxfischer2781/asyncstdlib/issues/161) for [my own library providing `async` versions of the standard library, specifically the `lru_cache`](https://github.com/maxfischer2781/asyncstdlib/blob/0cdd850f3ef221020a178fd4b34a095b423f0781/asyncstdlib/_lrucache.pyi#L34-L49). An MRE not using my library is below (in case I missed something that makes the MRE fixable but not my library, this would be good to know, too).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\nfrom typing import Any, overload, Callable, Concatenate\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Descriptor[C: Callable[..., Any]]:\r\n    def __init__(self, impl: C) -> None: ...\r\n\r\n    @overload\r\n    def __get__(\r\n        self: Descriptor[C], instance: None, owner: type | None\r\n    ) -> Descriptor[C]: ...\r\n\r\n    @overload\r\n    def __get__[S, **P, R](\r\n        self: Descriptor[Callable[Concatenate[S, P], R]], instance: S, owner: type | None,\r\n    ) -> Callable[P, R]: ...\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Test:\r\n    @Descriptor\r\n    def method(self, foo: int, bar: str) -> bytes: ...\r\n\r\n\r\nreveal_type(Test().method)\r\n# Pyright pyright 1.1.386    Type of \"Test().method\" is \"(foo: int, bar: str) -> bytes\"\r\n# MyPy 1.11                  Revealed type is \"def (foo: builtins.int, bar: builtins.str) -> builtins.bytes\"\r\n# MyPy 1.12                  Revealed type is \"Any\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Playground link.](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.12&gist=5503735d0ff9d5af1a979bdf441ed38c&enable-incomplete-feature=NewGenericSyntax) The ordering of the `overload` cases does not matter.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nMyPy should correctly infer the type of the bound method. MyPy should report the most suitable overload.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nMyPy matches none of the overloads and thus completely loses type information. The reported most suitable overload is actually the least suitable.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 1.12 and 1.13\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: None\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): defaults\r\n- Python version used: CPython 3.8 - 3.12\r\n\r\n<!-- You can freely edit this text, please remove all the lines you believe are unnecessary. -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18036/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18036/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
