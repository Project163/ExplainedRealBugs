planning to release mypy 0.900 some time in March. This release will have a particularly significant change, as third-party stubs are no longer shipped with mypy. They need to be installed by installing suitable stub packages. For example, `pip install types-requests` installs the stubs for Requests. Mypy will suggest the names of stub packages to install, and `mypy --install-types` will automatically install the suggested stub packages (this doesn't work with the mypy daemon, however).\r\n\r\nSince this change is potentially quite disruptive, I'm announcing the release here well ahead of the target release date.\r\n\r\nThe unbundling of typeshed is already implemented in GitHub master, so it's possible to start testing this right now.
