#15062 \r\n\r\nImplementing \"happy path\" took like couple dozen lines, but there are *a lot* of edge cases, e.g. where we need to fail gracefully. Also of course I checked my implementation (mostly) works for recursive variadic aliases :-) see test.\r\n\r\nIt looks like several pieces of support for proper variadic types (i.e. non-aliases, instances etc) are still missing, so I tried to fill in something where I needed it for type aliases, but not everywhere, some notable examples:\r\n* Type variable bound checks for instances are still broken, see TODO item in `semanal_typeargs.py`\r\n* I think type argument count check is still broken for instances (I think I fixed it for type aliases), there can be fewer than `len(type_vars) - 1` type arguments, e.g. if one of them is an unpack.\r\n* We should only prohibit multiple *variadic* unpacks in a type list, multiple fixed length unpacks are fine (I think I fixed this both for aliases and instances)\r\n\r\nBtw I was thinking about an example below, what should we do in such cases?\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Tuple, TypeVar\r\nfrom typing_extensions import TypeVarTuple, Unpack\r\n\r\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\r\nS = TypeVar(\"S\")\r\nTs = TypeVarTuple(\"Ts\")\r\n\r\nAlias = Tuple[T, S, Unpack[Ts], S]\r\n\r\ndef foo(*x: Unpack[Ts]) -> None:\r\n    y: Alias[Unpack[Ts], int, str]\r\n    reveal_type(y)  # <-- what is this type?\r\n\r\n# Ts = () => Tuple[int, str, str]\r\n# Ts = (bool) => Tuple[bool, int, str, int]\r\n# Ts = (bool, float) => Tuple[bool, float, int, str, float]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, I noticed there is already some code duplication, and I am not improving it. I am open to suggestions on how to reduce the code duplication.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15219/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15219/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9296490647,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5jh5N4zwAAAAIqHTCX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/9296490647","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-21T19:38:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9296490656,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5jh5N4zwAAAAIqHTCg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/9296490656","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0334ebcfab63a85814e1e129f309525b160f4094","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/0334ebcfab63a85814e1e129f309525b160f4094","created_at":"2023-05-21T19:38:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
