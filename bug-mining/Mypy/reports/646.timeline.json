If this pull request fixes an issue, add \"Fixes #NNN\" with the issue number. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #19896, #19902\r\n\r\n- `TypedDict.get` now ignores the type of the default when the key is required.\r\n- `reveal_type(d.get)` now gives an appropriate list of overloads\r\n- I kept the special casing for `get(subdict, {})`, but this is not visible in the overloads. Implementing this via overloads is blocked by #19895\r\n\r\nSome additional changes:\r\n\r\n- I added some code that ensures that the default type always appears last in the union (relevant when a union of multiple keys is given)\r\n- I ensure that the original value-type is use instead of its `proper_type`. This simplifies the return in `testRecursiveTypedDictMethods`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nChecklist:\r\n- Read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- Add tests for all changed behaviour.\r\n- If you can't add a test, please explain why and how you verified your changes work.\r\n- Make sure CI passes.\r\n- Please do not force push to the PR once it has been reviewed.\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19897/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19823817253,"node_id":"LE_lADOAGuhRc7M71alzwAAAASdl3Il","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/19823817253","actor":{"login":"sterliakov","id":50529348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTI5MzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50529348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov","html_url":"https://github.com/sterliakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-21T19:17:36Z","label":{"name":"topic-typed-dict","color":"d4c5f9"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19852262594,"node_id":"SE_lADOAGuhRc7M71alzwAAAASfSXzC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/19852262594","actor":{"login":"cdce8p","id":30130371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTMwMzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30130371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p","html_url":"https://github.com/cdce8p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-22T22:40:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20272167669,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc7M71alzwAAAAS4ULr1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/20272167669","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"843d133c12e34c781fb469fe50e02a7cacaae9ae","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/843d133c12e34c781fb469fe50e02a7cacaae9ae","created_at":"2025-10-14T14:50:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20272167701,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc7M71alzwAAAAS4ULsV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/20272167701","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github
