No error if there's no type hint in the constructor (type unimportant)\r\n    def __init__(self, args: int):\r\n        # The next line succeeds if it's a tuple, but fails on list.\r\n        self.var_a = []\r\n        # The type of this variable doesn't seem to matter at all, but it needs\r\n        # to exist and be trying to set a property.\r\n        self.var_b = None\r\n\r\n    # This needs to be a property, but the getter doesn't affect anything.\r\n    var_b = property(fset=lambda self, value: None)\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Child(Parent):\r\n    @property  # Error reported on this line.\r\n    def var_a(self):\r\n        return self._var_a\r\n\r\n    @var_a.setter\r\n    def var_a(self, value):\r\n        self._var_a = []\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was run with `mypy --show-traceback partial_list.py` in an empty venv, after deleting the `.mypy-cache` directory, and I don't think there's any other configuration being pulled from anywhere.\r\n\r\nThis was as small a reproducer as I could find.  It seems to matter that there are two properties (although one of them only needs a setter), and the child class seems to need to be overriding a partially typed instance variable with a getter property that's also partially typed.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: master:

#12109.\r\n\r\nThe original issue reported that the bug had to do with the use of the `--follow-imports=skip` flag. However, it turned out this was a red herring after closer inspection: I was able to trigger a more minimal repro both with and without this flag:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom enum import Enum\r\n\r\nclass Foo(Enum):\r\n    a = []  # E: Need type annotation for \"a\" (hint: \"a: List[<type>] = ...\")\r\n    b = None\r\n\r\n    def check(self) -> None:\r\n        reveal_type(Foo.a.value)  # N: Revealed type is \"<partial list[?]>\"\r\n        reveal_type(Foo.b.value)  # N: Revealed type is \"<partial None>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first two `reveal_types` demonstrate the crux of the bug: the enum plugin does not correctly handle and convert partial types into regular types when inferring the type of the `.value` field.\r\n\r\nThis can then cause any number of downstream problems. For example, suppose we modify `def check(...)` so it runs `reveal_type(self.value)`. Doing this will trigger a crash in mypy because it makes the enum plugin eventually try running `is_equivalent(...)` on the two partial types. But `is_equivalent` does not support partial types, so we crash.\r\n\r\nI opted to solve this problem by:\r\n\r\n1. Making the enum plugin explicitly call the `fixup_partial_types` function on all field types. This prevents the code from crashing.\r\n\r\n2. Modifies mypy so that Final vars are never marked as being PartialTypes. Without this, `reveal_type(Foo.b.value)` would report a type of `Union[Any, None]` instead of just `None`. (Note that all enum fields are implicitly final).\r\n\r\n<!-- If this pull request fixes an issue, add \"Fixes #NNN\" with the issue number. -->\r\n\r\n(Explain how this PR changes mypy.)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nChecklist:\r\n- Read the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n- Add tests for all changed behaviour.\r\n- If you can't add a test, please explain why and how you verified your changes work.\r\n- Make sure CI passes.\r\n- Please do not force push to the PR once it has been reviewed.\r\n-->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14021/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7752637746,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5CxLOIzwAAAAHOF90y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7752637746","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-07T13:28:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7752638322,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5CxLOIzwAAAAHOF99y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7752638322","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d2a3e667bf0bedb19a1e88baaf7f3ffebc12c74a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/d2a3e667bf0bedb19a1e88baaf7f3ffebc12c74a","created_at":"2022-11-07T13:28:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
