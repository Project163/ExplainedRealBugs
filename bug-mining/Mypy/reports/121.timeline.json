merges consecutive `GetAttr` and `Branch` ops.\r\n\r\nThe main benefit is that this makes the generated code smaller and easier to read, \r\nmaking it easier to spot possible improvements in the code.\r\n\r\nBenchmark results seem to be roughly the same as before, since the original\r\ncode could be optimized well by C compilers. I tried richards, deltablue and hexiom\r\nbenchmarks using clang and gcc, and the performance delta is from -2% to 2%,\r\nand the differences look pretty random.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11978/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11978/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1079725840","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12460#issuecomment-1079725840","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/12460","id":1079725840,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5AW08Q","user":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-26T16:19:20Z","updated_at":"2022-03-26T16:19:20Z","body":"The only suspicious thing I saw in the output is `cl : Command line warning D9002 : ignoring unknown option '/O0'`. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/o-options-optimize-code?view=msvc-170 doesn't mention O0.
