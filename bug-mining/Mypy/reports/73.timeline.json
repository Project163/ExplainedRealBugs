thing that bothered me for a long time is `getattr` and its very broad return type even for simplest cases:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Literal\r\n\r\nclass Some:\r\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\r\n        self.a = 1\r\n\r\ns = Some()\r\n\r\nreveal_type(s.a)  # Revealed type is \"builtins.int\"\r\nreveal_type(getattr(s, 'a'))  # Revealed type is \"Any\"\r\nreveal_type(getattr(s, 'b'))  # Revealed type is \"Any\"\r\nreveal_type(getattr(s, 'a', None))  # Revealed type is \"Union[Any, None]\"\r\n\r\na: Literal['a']\r\nreveal_type(getattr(s, a))  # Revealed type is \"Any\"\r\n\r\nab: Literal['a', 'b']\r\nreveal_type(getattr(s, ab))  # Revealed type is \"Any\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I propose to add better support for it to `mypy`.\r\n\r\nThe same example, after the support is added:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Literal\r\n\r\nclass Some:\r\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\r\n        self.a = 1\r\n\r\ns = Some()\r\n\r\nreveal_type(s.a)  # Revealed type is \"builtins.int\"\r\nreveal_type(getattr(s, 'a'))  # Revealed type is \"builtins.int\"\r\nreveal_type(getattr(s, 'b'))  # error: \"Some\" has no attribute \"b\"\r\nreveal_type(getattr(s, 'a', None))  # Revealed type is \"builtins.int\"\r\n\r\na: Literal['a']\r\nreveal_type(getattr(s, a))  # Revealed type is \"builtins.int\"\r\n\r\nab: Literal['a', 'b']\r\nreveal_type(getattr(s, ab))  # error: \"Some\" has no attribute \"b\"\r\nreveal_type(getattr(s, ab, None))  # Revealed type is \"builtins.int | None\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have even written a [custom plugin for it](https://github.com/wemake-services/mypy-extras/#attrof) at some point.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis pattern is quite popular among Python developers. `geattr(obj, 'string_key', None)` is used for compatibility, optional dependencies, etc. That's something you can find in almost any project.\r\n\r\nTechnical details\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nI am going to utilize existing [`checkmember`](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/7724) logic.\r\nI even plan to support attribute plugins, where possible, because `a.x` and `getattr(a, 'x')` are semantically identical.\r\nFor now only str literals and `Literal` str types are going to be supported.\r\n\r\nRelated issues and problems\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nI am calling this issue \"meta\", because there are several very related problems I want to mention / solve here:\r\n- [x] https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/1424\r\n- [x] https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10409\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nI will start with a PR with a code prototype in a couple of days.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11142/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":6},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11142/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"sobolevn","id":4660275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjAyNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4660275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn","html_url":"https://github.com/sobolevn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-20T15:45:46Z","updated_at":"2021-09-20T15:45:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11150","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11150/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11150/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11150/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/11150","id":1001121947,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGuhRc4r-Hs-","number":11150,"title":"Now
