[`mutable-override`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/error_code_list2.html#check-that-overrides-of-mutable-attributes-are-safe-mutable-override) that checks for unsafe overrides of mutable attributes:\r\n```python\r\nclass Parent:\r\n    x: float\r\n\r\nclass Child(Parent):\r\n    x: int  # E: Covariant override of a mutable attribute (base class \"Parent\" defined the type as \"float\", expression has type \"int\")  [mutable-override]\r\n```\r\n\r\n However, this error isn't emitted when overriding a callable attribute with a method:\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import
