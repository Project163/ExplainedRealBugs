The code changes are based on the suggestions in #13574.\r\n\r\nThe fix introduces an additional check if the property under inspection is of type `staticmethod`. If it is, the type information is read from the staticmethod's `__func__` attribute, instead of the staticmethod instance itself.\r\n\r\nI added a test for C++ classes with static methods bound using pybind11.
