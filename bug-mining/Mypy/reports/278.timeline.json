is decided to release mypy 1.0 in ~two months, as mypy is mature enough for such a milestone. We need to plan this well in advance, so I am already opening this issue.\r\n\r\nThe result of some _preliminary_ discussions is captured in [this doc](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/iuzho24aryok9935i0e1q/Mypy-release-1.0-planning-questions.paper?dl=0&rlkey=rxz6a0ei19mhbi2yq9ixjcvrg) (please let me know if you have access issues). I would propose to have a Zoom call on Monday Sep 26 afternoon Dublin time (unless there are objections) to discuss the release plans in more details.\r\n\r\nIf you have any comments, questions, ideas, please leave them here (note we will still have 0.990 release between 0.980 and 1.0).\r\n\r\ncc @JukkaL @jhance @JelleZijlstra @hauntsaninja @AlexWaygood @Michael0x2a @sobolevn @ethanhs @ilinum @svalentin (also please tag anyone I forgot here)\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\nMore important things (in arbitrary order):\r\n* [x] Fix more crash bugs (everyone)\r\n* [x] Give an error if annotated variable appears in un-annotated function (with an error code to opt-out)\r\n* [x] Safe handling of empty bodies (with a flag to opt-out, + new error codes) @ilevkivskyi \r\n* [x] Split `--enable-incomplete-features`\r\n* [ ] Implement as much of `Unpack` and `TypeVarTuple` as possible @jhance \r\n* [x] Enable recursive types by default @ilevkivskyi \r\n* [x] Make `implicit_optional` off by default (with a code transform tool to fix existing annotations) @hauntsaninja \r\n* [x] Detect unbound variables @ilinum \r\n* [ ] Use unions for ternary joins @JelleZijlstra \r\n* [x] Full support for non-typing 3.11 features, see https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12840\r\n* [x] Support as many typing 3.11 features as we can (including `Enum`)\r\n* [x] Make `--namespace-packages` the default @hauntsaninja \r\n* [ ] Allow/disallow PEP 561 packages @ethanhs \r\n\r\nLess important things:\r\n* [ ] Support default value of generic parameter\r\n* [ ] Always narrow types (see #2008)\r\n* [ ] Fix lost narrowing in inner functions\r\n* [ ] Make `--local-partial-types` enabled by default (if fallout is not bad)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13685/reactions","total_count":35,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":17,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":18,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13685/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8463543464,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5d0taWzwAAAAH4d2yo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/8463543464","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"03981f3e31b6515258ce1cd09885f77fdb0d647b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hauntsaninja/mypy/commits/03981f3e31b6515258ce1cd09885f77fdb0d647b","created_at":"2023-02-08T01:08:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-08T01:08:47Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T01:08:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14642","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14642/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14642/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14642/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14642","id":1575286115,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGuhRc5Je16M","number":14642,"title":"Fix
