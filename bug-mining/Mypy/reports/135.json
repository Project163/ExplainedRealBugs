Some ways that I've done this are:\r\n```python\r\nimport functools\r\ntotal_ordering = functools.total_ordering\r\n\r\n@total_ordering\r\nclass D(Generic[T]): ...\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```python\r\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\r\n    _T = TypeVar(\"_T\")\r\n    def total_ordering(cls: Type[_T]) -> Type[_T]:\r\n        return cls\r\nelse:\r\n    from functools import total_ordering\r\n\r\n@total_ordering\r\nclass D(Generic[T]): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 01a2d98bc480ea9e1575f2adab47c0cfbca1c8d0\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: None\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): No mypy.ini\r\n- Python version used: Python 3.8\r\n- Operating system and version: Debian 10","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11728/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
