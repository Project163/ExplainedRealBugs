It is right behaviour, I think, but it should be documented in https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_file.html#confval-strict and https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-strict.\n\nI.e. it should be clearly stated that if both `strict` and some strict-included flags are set, then `strict` does not take precedence.\n\n---\n\nAlso, the phrase \"enables all optional error checking flags\" is very confusing. `strict` does not enable **all** optional flags, but a defined subset of them. Look at https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/7767#issuecomment-1385967214 by @hauntsaninja :\n\n> mostly the set of checks needed to ensure that you do not have any type unsoundness without an explicit circumvention of the type system, like type ignore, explicit use of Any or cast\n\nMaybe the phrase \"enables all optional error checking flags\" should be changed to aforementioned definition, or to something like \"enables optional flags recommended by python devs\", or just deleted.","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
