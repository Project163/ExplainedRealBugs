TypeGuard narrowing when calling temporary objects that have a `__call__` method with TypeGuard annotations. This addresses issue #19575.\n\n## Problem\n\nPreviously, TypeGuard narrowing only worked for direct function calls but failed for temporary objects:\n\n```python\nfrom typing_extensions import TypeGuard\n\nclass E:\n    def __init__(self) -> None: ...\n    def __call__(self, o: object) -> TypeGuard[int]:\n        return True\n\nx = object()\nif E()(x):  # E() creates temporary object, then calls it\n    reveal_type(x)  # Before: \"builtins.object\", Expected: \"builtins.int\"\n```\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe TypeGuard narrowing logic in `find_isinstance_check_helper` only handled `RefExpr` callees (direct function references) but not `CallExpr` callees (results of function calls). When mypy encounters `E()(x)`:\n\n- `E()` is a `CallExpr` that returns an instance of class `E`  \n- The entire expression `E()(x)` is another `CallExpr` where the callee is the first `CallExpr`\n- Since the callee wasn't a `RefExpr`, TypeGuard narrowing was skipped\n\n## Solution\n\nAdded comprehensive `CallExpr` handling to `find_isinstance_check_helper` that:\n\n1. **Resolves callee type**: Gets the result type of the callee `CallExpr` and finds its `__call__` member\n2. **Detects TypeGuard**: Checks if the `__call__` method has `type_guard` or `type_is` attributes\n3. **Handles arguments**: Supports both positional (`E()(x)`) and keyword (`E()(obj=x)`) arguments\n4. **Supports overloads**: Works with overloaded `__call__` methods using first overload for parameter lookup\n5. **Includes safety checks**: Validates arguments exist and provides appropriate error messages\n\n## Test Coverage\n\nThe fix handles multiple scenarios:\n- Basic calls: `E()(x)`\n- Keyword arguments: `E()(obj=x)` \n- Both `TypeGuard[T]` and `TypeIs[T]` return types\n- Overloaded `__call__` methods\n- Chained calls: `Factory().create_guard()(x)`\n\n## Verification\n\nThe existing test case `testNoCrashOnDunderCallTypeGuardTemporaryObject` now passes, with `reveal_type(x)` correctly showing `\"builtins.int\"` instead of `\"builtins.object\"`.\n\nThis change maintains full backward compatibility while extending TypeGuard functionality to work with any callable temporary object.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💡 You can make Copilot smarter by setting up custom instructions, customizing its development environment and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
