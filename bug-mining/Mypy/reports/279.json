(It doesn't complain for the first case)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nhttps://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.11&gist=f0900514987ceef340db8076b6319cd8\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure the code is fine and that there's no way the variable is actually undefined.  I also realize that I can rewrite the code to be `case 5 as value:` to work around the issue.  Also, I realize the example is trivial but imagine if the `5` was `int()`.\r\n    \r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n<!-- What went wrong?
