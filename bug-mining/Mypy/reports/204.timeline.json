feels like a CPython bug, since stubtest is just calling `inspect.getsourcelines`. I think the relevant lines are here: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b44372e03c5461b6ad3d89763a9eb6cb82df07a4/Lib/inspect.py#L946\r\n\r\nBasically, inspect doesn't try to find a source file if the object's `__file__` has one of the `importlib.machinery.EXTENSION_SUFFIXES`. But in this case, I suppose pywin32 exposes an object with a `__file__` that points to a .dll.\r\n\r\nWhere should this be fixed?\r\n- Maybe CPython should try harder to avoid loading binary files as source files. But I don't know if that's going to be fully reliable, and people do load Python code from files with non-`.py` extension files.\r\n- Maybe pywin32 shouldn't set a `__file__` pointing to a file that's not a valid extension module.\r\n- Maybe stubtest should be more resilient to `getsourcelines()` failing. That's not very principled, but it's good for stubtest to be resilient to odd failures, so I think we should do that.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1269097866/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"Avasam","id":1350584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTA1ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1350584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Avasam","html_url":"https://github.com/Avasam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Avasam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Avasam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Avasam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Avasam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Avasam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Avasam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Avasam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Avasam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Avasam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-07T17:40:48Z","updated_at":"2022-10-07T17:40:48Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/typeshed/issues/8866","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/typeshed","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/typeshed/issues/8866/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/typeshed/issues/8866/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/typeshed/issues/8866/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/8866","id":1401490929,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAeOl_85AaTl0","number":8866,"title":"pywin32:

Add all of the \"shortcuts\" (aliases? Not sure how to call them) to modules that can be called as root modules.**\\*** As well as win32com to win32extcom. These are how those modules are actually used and documented (ie: `import win32con` and `import win32com` rather than `import win32.lib.win32con` and `import win32comext`.\\). Though both are valid imports.\r\n![](https://files.gitter.im/593eb17dd73408ce4f66bb09/TVvs/image.png)\r\n\r\nSome modules could not be fully generated with stubgen because of https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13822 . Some couldn't because `win32ui` needs to be imported first.\r\nWe can't run stubtest on the CI anyway because of #8660, but if we could, the same mypy issue would result in an error (I had to comment out the imports and delete the modules while testing locally)\r\n\r\n**\\*** Is there a cleaner way to do this in stubs environment than adding a bunch of top-level modules?
