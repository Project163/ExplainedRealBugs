Pull Request Fixes #16669 . This pull request makes a one line change to mypy/pyinfo.py to force the stdout of the python process to use utf-8.\r\n\r\nOne can replicate this error in Windows using Python3.8 just by calling the mypy/pyinfo.py module using a slightly modified code of the  `get_search_dirs` function where the python executable doesn't match the value of sys.executable.
