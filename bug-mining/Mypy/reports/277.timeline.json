I would propose to have a Zoom call on Monday Sep 26 afternoon Dublin time (unless there are objections) to discuss the release plans in more details.\r\n\r\nIf you have any comments, questions, ideas, please leave them here (note we will still have 0.990 release between 0.980 and 1.0).\r\n\r\ncc @JukkaL @jhance @JelleZijlstra @hauntsaninja @AlexWaygood @Michael0x2a @sobolevn @ethanhs @ilinum @svalentin (also please tag anyone I forgot here)\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\nMore important things (in arbitrary order):\r\n* [x] Fix more crash bugs (everyone)\r\n* [x] Give an error if annotated variable appears in un-annotated function (with an error code to opt-out)\r\n* [x] Safe handling of empty bodies (with a flag to opt-out, + new error codes) @ilevkivskyi \r\n* [x] Split `--enable-incomplete-features`\r\n* [ ] Implement as much of `Unpack` and `TypeVarTuple` as possible @jhance \r\n* [x] Enable recursive types by default @ilevkivskyi \r\n* [x] Make `implicit_optional` off by default (with a code transform tool to fix existing annotations) @hauntsaninja \r\n* [x] Detect unbound variables @ilinum \r\n* [ ] Use unions for ternary joins @JelleZijlstra \r\n* [x] Full support for non-typing 3.11 features, see https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12840\r\n* [x] Support as many typing 3.11 features as we can (including `Enum`)\r\n* [x] Make `--namespace-packages` the default @hauntsaninja \r\n* [ ] Allow/disallow PEP 561 packages @ethanhs \r\n\r\nLess important things:\r\n* [ ] Support default value of generic parameter\r\n* [ ] Always narrow types (see #2008)\r\n* [ ] Fix lost narrowing in inner functions\r\n* [ ] Make `--local-partial-types` enabled by default (if fallout is not bad)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13685/reactions","total_count":35,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":17,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":18,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13685/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ilinum","id":5924452,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MjQ0NTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5924452?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum","html_url":"https://github.com/ilinum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilinum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-08T16:53:04Z","updated_at":"2023-02-08T16:53:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14646","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14646/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14646/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14646/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14646","id":1576472031,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGuhRc5Ji0Nm","number":14646,"title":"[used

Report**\r\n\r\nI'm getting the following mypy error `used-before-def` on the code snippet below:\r\n\r\nI played around a bit trying to simplify, but there could be other scenarios I haven't explored.\r\n\r\nGeneralizing what I deem the problem to be: \r\n\r\n### WHEN:\r\n* A function is defined whereby\r\n* it calls a callable object\r\n* AND inside the call there an assignment to a new variable\r\n* AND the call returns another callable object\r\n* AND the other callable object is supplied the new variable defined in the previous call\r\n\r\n#### THEN:\r\nthe `used-before-def` error is generated even though there is nothing at all incorrect in this scenario since the new variable would _ALWAYS_ be available.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nrun `mypy` version 1.0 on the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Any\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Reporter:\r\n    def __init__(self, x: Any):\r\n        self.x: Any = x\r\n\r\n    def report(self, y: Any = None):\r\n        print(self.x)\r\n        if y is not None:\r\n            print(y)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef foo(z: Any):\r\n    Reporter(x := z).report(x)\r\n\r\n\r\nfor i in range(10):\r\n    foo(i)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nNo error should be generated.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npyteal/walrus.py:15 error: Name \"x\" is used before definition  [used-before-def]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\nPython 3.11.1 running on mac Ventura 13.1\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 1.0\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: none\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config
