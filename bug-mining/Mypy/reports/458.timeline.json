is the sequel to https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11201. It's awesome to see most of the things in that issue fixed.\n\n### Type System Features\n\n- ~**PEP 695** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/15238~\n- ~**PEP 702** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/16111~\n- **PEP 675** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12554\n- **PEP 696** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14851\n\n### Behaviour changes\n\n- ~**Ternary unions** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12056~\n\n  We should use unions in some places we currently join, see https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12056#issuecomment-1694422734\n\n  Update: We now use unions in more places, including ternary expressions. Feel free to investigate this more though!\n\n- **Always narrow types** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/2008#issuecomment-296213676 (proposal 3)\n\n  Users find it surprising because it seems obvious that mypy should know the variable is of the narrower type. There was a big discussion in typing-sig and all the type checkers agreed this behaviour was probably the best. The change is very easy, but exposes bugs in binder\n\n- **Default value of generic parameters** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3737#issuecomment-552840010\n\n  It's totally reasonable to want to have generic parameters with defaults, we should error at call sites in case of badness\n\n- **Support narrowing Literal** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12535\n\n  It's hard to really use Literal types without a good way to narrow them. We should also narrow on `==`. I think last time I tried this it exposed bugs in binder\n\n- ~**Support property setters with broader types** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3004~\n\n  Should also allow covariant overrides of getter\n\n- **Better handling of `__new__`** https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16020\n\n  This is part of the Python language and comes up weirdly frequently. \n\n- **Love for match statement** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Atopic-match-statement+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc\n\n  Update: I fixed the most popular of these issues, but there's still a long tail of them\n\n- **PEP 688** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/15313\n\n  Easy, is just a somewhat breaking change\n\n### UI\n\n- **Per module strict=true** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11401\n\n  There's maybe some other UI stuff we can think about for groups of flags and error codes, as discussed in meetup. I also don't like the new `--extra-checks` since flag name doesn't mean anything and can't be decomposed.\n\n- ~**Ability to override PEP 561** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/8545~\n\n  It would be nice to be able to opt-in to treating packages missing py.typed as having py.typed. mypy can still provide a lot of value just based on function shape.\n\n  Update: this is now `--follow-untyped-imports` (can be set per-module)\n\n- **Exclude should imply per-module follow_import=skip** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10377\n\n  Currently `--exclude` only affects file discovery on command line, not import following. This is a source of frustration for users because the relevant modules can still end up being type checked.\n\n- **Provide flag to generate stubs requirements** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10600#issuecomment-950170169\n\n  `--install-types` is slow, results in unstable type checking, doesn't let users manage their own envs, can fail unclearly if cache isn't written\n\n- **Rethink stub suggestion logic** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10619\n\n  Our current behaviour was needed to help the migration to modular typeshed, but is not behaviour we'd have designed from scratch.\n\n### Gradual typing\n\n- **Make `check_untyped_defs = True` the default** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3948#issuecomment-890060233  / https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/6646\n\n  We decided not to do this for mypy 1.0, but could still make sense in the future.\n\n- **Infer obvious return types** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/4409 / https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10149\n\n  As a 1/3-way measure, we could also do https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/9413\n\n- **Infer method types from superclass** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3903#issuecomment-408833797\n\n### Performance\n\n- **Parallel type checking** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/933\n- **Faster caching** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3456\n\n### Misc\n\n- ~**Member access** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/7724~\n\n- **Merge configuration docs** https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/12347\n\n\nSee also a similar issue for mypyc here: https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc/issues/785\n\n(other maintainers, feel free to

Possibly, it can also replace part of the mechanism described in #31830.\r\n\r\n## TLDR\r\nSee the tests i wrote, for the demo of how it works (look at the end of the file). \r\n\r\nI want to add a decorator (for now only for classes, functions, methods etc.) that we can use for deprecations in the entire codebase (core and providers). By defining a custom function, we can have the most common information (now included in deprecation message) as separate arguments, so it's easier to parse it and use in CI, docs etc.\r\n\r\n## To do in next PRs\r\n\r\n- Possibly some changes in the documentation will be required, to describe how the developers should deprecate things and what are the options.\r\n- We can probably remove the warnings from current location (`airflow.exceptions.py`) and only keep them in `airflow.deprecation.py`, but this requires some time to migrate etc. so I am not sure how do properly do it.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\nThis is my first PR that touches the core airflow, so let me know if anything needs to be changed 😄  I also have some questions to the functionality itself:\r\n\r\n1. Are there any more arguments that we can define in the deprecation decorator? Some ideas?\r\n2. Is it a good place (deprecation module in core) to have helper functions like: `get_callable_full_path` or `validate_release_string`. We can just make them private.\r\n3. Should we define separate `provider_deprecated` decorator that will have a default category set to AirflowProviderDeprecationWarning ?\r\n4. Should we allow passing a different Adapter, so that You can alter the deprecation message or we want to enforce standardization in the whole codebase and remove that option for the end user?\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

#2772.\r\nAlso based on the work and discussions in #2772, #2773, #7430, and #8698.\r\nSeemingly unblocked by #11867.\r\n\r\nThis attempts to deprecate the current less restrictive and less accurate signatures of `contextlib.(async)contextmanager` using the `deprecated` decorator to provide users with a transition period (hopefully with less type checker screaming than in previous attempts). The text currently in `deprecated()` could be modified to convey a time period as well if that could be agreed upon, e.g. \"will be disallowed in (3.14 | 6 months | 1 year)\".\r\n\r\n**Additional Rationale**\r\nI'm not aware if there're any problems with using `deprecated` in this manner, but if so, this might be as good a place as any to inspire a discussion about them. I'd argue it's not the worst idea, since technically typeshed's signatures for these functions have been inconsistent with the runtime for ages. Thus, even if this usage isn't based on a runtime change as other uses of `deprecated` seem to be, it can still do what it's meant to: provide some sort of user feedback on a use case being explicitly less accurate or less valid, and potentially mark a predefined time frame for transitioning from one to the other.\r\n\r\nConsidering a major blocker in previous attempts to fix the signatures was the amount of \"breakage\" it would cause, this feels softer, arguably too soft if maintainers don't have the right flag set in their type checkers to generate a \"deprecated\" warning error. Still, it's better than before; at least with the right type checker setting on, there's *some* signal about the more correct signature.\r\n\r\n**Potential Improvements and/or Alternatives**\r\n- In the undeprecated overload, we could use custom protocols that aren't as narrow as `(Async)Generator` in place of the current parameter annotations, as outlined [here](https://github.com/python/typeshed/issues/2772#issuecomment-871438097). They would need to support `__(a)next__()`, `(a)throw()`, and probably now `(a)close()`, based on [what's used at runtime](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/bd6d4ed6454378e48dab06f50a9be0bae6baa3a2/Lib/contextlib.py#L129). Something like this, perhaps, going off of the linked example:\r\n\r\n  ```py\r\n  from typing import Protocol, TypeVar\r\n  from types import TracebackType\r\n  \r\n  _T = TypeVar(\"_T\")\r\n\r\n  # The protocol names are wide open for bikeshedding.\r\n  class ThrowableIterator(Protocol[_T]):\r\n      def __next__(self) -> _T: ...\r\n      \r\n      # Note: The most accurate annotated signature for 'throw()' seem to require overloads,\r\n      # if we're going off of 'Generator.throw()', but for the sake of being more succinct,\r\n      # they aren't included here.\r\n      def throw(\r\n          self,\r\n          exc_type: type[BaseException] | None,\r\n          exc_inst: BaseException | None,\r\n          exc_tb: TracebackType | None,\r\n      ) -> Any: ...\r\n      \r\n      # The use of '(a)close()' in '(async)contextmanager' was backported all the way to 3.11.\r\n      # Ref: https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/110378.\r\n      if sys.version_info >= (3, 11):\r\n          def close(self) -> None: ...\r\n          \r\n  class AsyncThrowableIterator(Protocol[_T]): ...  # The async counterpart methods would be in here.\r\n  ```\r\n- We can use `sys.version_info` to mark a clear cutoff point where the signature would no longer be \"acceptable\". From what I can tell, typeshed doesn't have an explicit deprecation policy for this kind of case, though this might be one way to implement it were it to exist. For example:\r\n  ```py\r\n  if sys.version_info >= (3, 14):\r\n      # Keep just the accurate signature here.\r\n  else:\r\n      # Keep the new overload and 'deprecated' overload here, or just the original signature\r\n      # if the former isn't accepted.\r\n  ```\r\n  I feel like this case might be exceptional enough to warrant explicit deprecation cutoff points like this, given the concern about breakage before and how long the incorrect signature has existed without anything like a fix merged (the first issue linked above is over 5 years old now, for reference).\r\n- We can perform other actions outside of this PR to signal and help with the transition, e.g. pin an informational issue in the issue tracker commenting on the change, the reasons why, and how to adjust.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nDeferred until mypy supports `@deprecated` (with release

screenshot demo are referencing fe1917e3d4986dfa431f428146819622b83b6546 which also has a class implementation\r\n- [x] Add an equivalent (in terms of parameters) warning version for deprecated code paths. \r\n\t- This wouldn't have the same static typing benefits, but would issue consistent messages and reduce repetition like in

Only applicable to static type checkers, doesn't emit a runtime warning\r\n\t- Working around this would be possible, but not trivial\r\n\t- E.g. calling `typing.get_overloads`, writing some handler logic\r\n- Having the message displayed **requires** using the `typing_extensions` decorator\r\n\t- Which means manually maintaining consistent messages\r\n\t- Cannot enforce `version` included\r\n- Even with those conditions met, it still starts with *The function \"save\" is deprecated ...* - which is misleading\r\n\t- The deprecated part is the combination of arguments\r\n\t- In this case, the `webdriver` argument\r\n- It adds a lot of extra `@overload` code, which I don't think is warranted given the other
