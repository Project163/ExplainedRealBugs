<b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nAccording to the [enum library docs](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/enum.html#private-names), since Python 3.11 any attribute in an Enum with a private/mangled name will not be converted into an Enum object but will be left as an attribute. In my Python 3.12.2 interpreter, this works as expected. However, Pylance still thinks that its type will be Literal. An example where this happens looks like this:\r\n```\r\nclass MyEnum(enum.Enum):\r\n    A = 1\r\n    B = 2\r\n    C = 3\r\n\r\n    __my_dict = {MyEnum.A: \"ham\", MyEnum.B: \"spam\", MyEnum.C: \"egg\"}\r\n\r\n    def find_str(self):\r\n        return self.__my_dict.get(self) # Incorrect type hint error on this line\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error produced is as follows:\r\n```\r\nCannot access member \"get\" for type \"Literal[MyEnum.__my_dict]\"\r\n  Member \"get\" is unknown\r\n```\r\n\r\nExtension version: 2024.4.1\r\nVS Code version: Code 1.87.2 (Universal)
