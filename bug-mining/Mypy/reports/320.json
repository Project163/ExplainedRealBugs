Using the `TypeVar` seems to cause the crash (if I don't reference the `TypeVar` then mypy points out \"Recursive types are not allowed at function scope\").\r\n\r\nAfter looking into this, I am now aware that what I was trying to do is [explicitly forbidden by PEP-613](https://peps.python.org/pep-0613/) 😅\r\n\r\n(If I explicitly set the type to `TypeAlias` in the function (i.e. I specify `foo: TypeAlias` in my example), then Pylance/VSCode shows the error \"A TypeAlias can be defined only within a module or class scope\", but mypy still crashes.)\r\n\r\nWhen I move the `TypeAlias` declaration outside of the function, in compliance with PEP-613, everything works again. (I can leave the `TypeVar` inside and it's fine.)\r\n\r\n**Traceback**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mypy repro.py --show-traceback\r\nrepro.py:8: error: INTERNAL ERROR -- Please try using mypy master on GitHub:\r\nhttps://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#using-a-development-mypy-build\r\nPlease report a bug at https://github.com/python/mypy/issues\r\nversion: 1.2.0\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"mypy/semanal.py\", line 6272, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 774, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/semanal.py\", line 831, in visit_func_def\r\n  File \"mypy/semanal.py\", line 863, in analyze_func_def\r\n  File \"mypy/typeanal.py\", line 944, in visit_callable_type\r\n  File \"mypy/typeanal.py\", line 1549, in anal_var_defs\r\n  File \"mypy/typeanal.py\", line 1541, in anal_var_def\r\n  File \"mypy/types.py\", line 2847, in accept\r\n  File \"mypy/typeanal.py\", line 1112, in visit_placeholder_type\r\n  File \"mypy/semanal.py\", line 5586, in lookup_fully_qualified\r\n  File \"mypy/semanal.py\", line 5602, in lookup_fully_qualified_or_none\r\nAssertionError: \r\nrepro.py:8: : note: use --pdb to drop into pdb\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python3\r\nfrom typing import TypeVar\r\n\r\n\r\ndef dummy() -> None:\r\n    foo = int | str | dict[str, \"foo\"]\r\n    T = TypeVar(\"T\", bound=foo)\r\n\r\n    def bar(x: T) -> T:\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 1.2.0 (also seen with 0.991)\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: None\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): None (removed them to reproduce the issue)\r\n- Python version used: 3.11\r\n- Operating system and version: MacOS 13.2.1 Ventura\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15018/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
