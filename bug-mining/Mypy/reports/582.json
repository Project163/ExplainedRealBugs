No error is reported when used with `func3`, which I believe is an equivalent function, only using `overload` instead of a `TypeVar`.\n\nThis looks like it may be related to https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/15215\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n- Mypy version used: 1.15\n- Mypy command-line flags: None\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): None\n- Python version used: 3.13\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18953/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18953/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
