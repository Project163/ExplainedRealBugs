Sometimes, it accepts a file, sometimes it doesn't. Once it has accepted a file it seems to cache this solution, and I need to wipe `.mypy_cache` to be able to reproduce the random behavior again.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nDownload and extract the following archive ([repro.tar.gz](https://github.com/python/mypy/files/14467193/repro.tar.gz)), which contains stubs from a library I am developing along with a `test.py` file to be checked.\r\n\r\nThis is output from an actual run on my end:\r\n```\r\n$ mypy test.py\r\ntest.py:74: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"object\", variable has type \"Array3f\")  [assignment]\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n\r\n$ mypy test.py\r\nSuccess: no issues found in 1 source file\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Details on setup**: mypy 1.8.0 (compiled: yes), Python 3.12.2, on an Apple M1 laptop (macOS 16.6.2). The machine is and has been perfectly stable. That is to say: I don't expect cosmic rays or RAM corruption to be responsible ;).","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16979/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
