 If you're new to mypy and you're not sure whether what you're experiencing is a mypy bug, please see the \"Question and Help\" form\r\n  instead.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`is` and `==` work strangely together when narrowing the type of an `Enum` in an if-elif block.  [It is known](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/6366#issuecomment-673876383) that you need to use `is` rather than `==` to narrow the type of an `Enum`, but it seems if the `if` statement uses `is` then the `elif` can have `==` and still narrow the type of the variable.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```\r\nfrom enum import Enum\r\n\r\nclass Foo(Enum):\r\n    A = 1\r\n    B = 2\r\n    C = 3\r\n\r\ndef f0(x: Foo) -> str:\r\n    if x is Foo.A:\r\n        return 'one'\r\n    elif x == Foo.B:\r\n        return 'two'\r\n    elif x == Foo.C:\r\n        return 'three'\r\n    reveal_type(x)  # Not revealed by mypy as it apparently considers this line unreachable\r\n```\r\nThis is compared to how have come to expect `==` to work with an enum where it will not narrow the type.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef f1(x: Foo) -> str:\r\n    if x == Foo.A:\r\n        return 'one'\r\n    elif x == Foo.B:\r\n        return 'two'\r\n    elif x == Foo.C:\r\n        return 'three'\r\n    reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is Foo\r\n```\r\nInterestingly this doesn't just occur when an `is` is used in the `if`.  It can occur in an `elif` and still \"propogate\" its narrowing ability to the following `==`'s.\r\n```\r\ndef f2(x: Foo) -> str:\r\n    if x == Foo.A:\r\n        return 'one'\r\n    elif x is Foo.B:\r\n        return 'two'\r\n    elif x == Foo.C:\r\n        return 'three'\r\n    reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is Literal[Foo.A]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\n\r\n`==` would either narrow the type of an enum or not and it would not depend on whether or not it was preceded by an `is`.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n`==` narrows the type of an enum only when it is preceded by an `is`.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 0.790\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: none or `--strict` will both demonstrate this behavior\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files):\r\n```\r\n[mypy]\r\ndisallow_any_decorated = True\r\ndisallow_any_explicit = True\r\ndisallow_any_generics = True\r\ndisallow_subclassing_any = True\r\ndisallow_untyped_defs = True\r\ndisallow_untyped_calls = True\r\ndisallow_incomplete_defs = True\r\ndisallow_untyped_decorators = True\r\n```\r\n- Python version used: 3.9.0\r\n- Operating system and version: Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS under WSL\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/9786/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/9786/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1086051039","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10915#issuecomment-1086051039","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/10915","id":1086051039,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5Au9Lf","user":{"login":"parsons-kyle-89","id":31140928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTQwOTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31140928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parsons-kyle-89","html_url":"https://github.com/parsons-kyle-89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parsons-kyle-89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parsons-kyle-89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parsons-kyle-89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parsons-kyle-89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parsons-kyle-89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parsons-kyle-89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parsons-kyle-89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parsons-kyle-89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parsons-kyle-89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-01T15:39:21Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T15:39:21Z","body":"Last I checked (which _was_ all the way back in version 0.790), the behavior was even stranger than presented here.  `==` _did_ narrow narrow Enums in if-else blocks, but only if they followed an `is`.
