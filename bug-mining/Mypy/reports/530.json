Although there are a couple more in the code, it only complains about this one as far as I can tell. Replacing it with an semantically equivalent if-else gives me type warnings and errors instead (the expected result considering that these seem all valid).\n\n**Traceback**\n\n```\n❯ uv run --with mypy[mypyc] mypyc -p nyl --show-traceback\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"mypyc/irbuild/builder.py\", line 272, in accept\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 1648, in accept\n  File \"mypyc/irbuild/visitor.py\", line 252, in visit_match_stmt\n  File \"mypyc/irbuild/statement.py\", line 1022, in transform_match_stmt\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 1648, in accept\n  File \"mypyc/irbuild/match.py\", line 92, in visit_match_stmt\n  File \"mypy/patterns.py\", line 150, in accept\n  File \"mypyc/irbuild/match.py\", line 164, in visit_class_pattern\nsrc/nyl/generator/components.py:81: AssertionError: \n```\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n1. Clone https://github.com/helsing-ai/nyl and check out `0.8.1` (that is HEAD today)\n2. Run `uv run --with mypy[mypyc]==1.13.0 mypyc -p nyl`\n\nThe specific piece of code that it seems to hiccup on is this:\n\nhttps://github.com/helsing-ai/nyl/blob/659ffec8e4b8362f8012e0b096fe4b2606861586/src/nyl/generator/components.py#L81-L92\n\n```py\n        match component:\n            case HelmComponent(path):\n                chart = HelmChart(\n                    metadata=instance.metadata,\n                    spec=HelmChartSpec(\n                        chart=ChartRef(path=str(path.resolve())),\n                        values={\"metadata\": resource[\"metadata\"], **instance.spec},\n                    ),\n                )\n                return self.helm_generator.generate(chart)\n            case _:\n                raise RuntimeError(f\"unexpected component type: {component}\")\n```\n\nThere are a couple more match statements in the code which it doesn't seem to complain about after changing this to use if-else instead. I'm not exactly sure where best to start to reduce it to a smaller example.\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\n\n- Mypy version used: 1.13.0\n- Mypy command-line flags: -p nyl\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files):\n    ```\n    explicit_package_bases = true\n    namespace_packages = true\n    show_column_numbers = true\n    strict = true\n    mypy_path = [\"src\"]\n    ```\n- Python version used: 3.11.9\n- Operating system and version: WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18614/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
