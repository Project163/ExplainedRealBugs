Report**\n\nWhen using a dataclass with `slots=True` or `__slots__`, if an argument to a function is annotated with `Self` (not necessarily the `self` argument), then assigning to an attribute not annotated in slots doesn't raise an error.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nType check the below ([playground](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.12&gist=87ddfc2fb7de73512b2d91a6c8a616f9)). \n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Self\n\n@dataclass(slots=True)\nclass Exp:\n    x: int\n    def foo(self) -> None:\n        self.y = 1\n    def bar(self, arg: Self) -> None:\n        self.y = 1\n    def baz(self: Self) -> None:\n        self.y = 1\n\nclass Exp2:\n    __slots__ = 'x',\n    x: int\n    def foo(self) -> None:\n        self.y = 1\n    def bar(self, arg: Self) -> None:\n        self.y = 1\n    def baz(self: Self) -> None:\n        self.y = 1\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nAll 3 invalid asignments to `y` would raise an error, dataclass or not.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\nOnly the `foo` function raises an error for assigning to an attribute not in slots.\n```text\nmain.py:8: error: Trying to assign name \"y\" that is not in \"__slots__\" of type \"__main__.Exp\"  [misc]\nmain.py:18: error: Trying to assign name \"y\" that is not in \"__slots__\" of type \"__main__.Exp2\"  [misc]\nFound 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n```\n**Your Environment**\n\n- Mypy version used: 1.16.1\n- Python version used: 3.12\n","closed_by":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19331/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
