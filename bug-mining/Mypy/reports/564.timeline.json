As usual, there are two things that are most difficult to get correctly... And this one is a caching issue.\n\nWhen we look up sources, we may run `build.in_partial_package`. It swallows `ModuleNotFound` errors, but the lookup result is cached at a lower level. This block should've caught our case:\n\nhttps://github.com/python/mypy/blob/bd1f51ac4de637ab1cbe9f633cdd401d0b520112/mypy/modulefinder.py#L579-L581\n\n...except that it doesn't because `in_partial_package` was called too early, `ns_ancestors` wasn't populated yet. And cache is already poisoned with `ModuleNotFoundReason.NOT_FOUND`, so we will happily return that when asked for `google` next time.\n\nI have a patch for this, but haven't managed to extract a simple testcase yet. Let's move the following discussion to
