`typing.Self` for classmethods of an `Enum` subclass, but mypy fails the type check for such methods.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nhttps://mypy-play.net/?mypy=master&python=3.12&gist=9f529a65422ee83aba0312c91e74a935\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom enum import *\r\nfrom typing import *\r\n\r\nclass Foo(Enum):\r\n    BAR = \"bar\"\r\n\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def get_bar(cls) -> Self:\r\n        return cls.BAR\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\nType checking should pass.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\nI get the following error:\r\n```\r\nmain.py:9: error: Incompatible return value type (got \"Foo\", expected \"Self\")  [return-value]\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 1.13.0, 1.14.0, master branch\r\n- Mypy command-line
