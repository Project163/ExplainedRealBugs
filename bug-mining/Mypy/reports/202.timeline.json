#13806\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for a FORCE_COLOR environment variable. If both MYPY_FORCE_COLOR and FORCE_COLOR are present, mypy will continue to use MYPY_FORCE_COLOR over FORCE_COLOR. However, if only FORCE_COLOR is set, mypy will use that environment variable in much the same way it currently uses MYPY_FORCE_COLOR.\r\n\r\nMYPY_FORCE_COLOR appears to be undocumented and untested currently, so this PR doesn't add any tests. However, @hugovk has tested this change manually and using GitHub Actions, and reports that it appears to work as expected.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13814/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13814/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7520199002,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5TLa3-zwAAAAHAPSFa","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7520199002","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-04T21:31:15Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7520199126,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5TLa3-zwAAAAHAPSHW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7520199126","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0cab54432a1df91a9b71637b773bcbb9772a6b59","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/0cab54432a1df91a9b71637b773bcbb9772a6b59","created_at":"2022-10-04T21:31:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"hugovk","id":1324225,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQyMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1324225?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk","html_url":"https://github.com/hugovk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hugovk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-04T22:17:22Z","updated_at":"2022-10-04T22:17:22Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/1691","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jazzband/pip-tools","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/1691/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/1691/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/1691/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/pull/1691","id":1395475549,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAFexE85AGDSp","number":1691,"title":"Colorize

is more of a braindump rather than a well-considered feature request, as I am not an expert in the domain. The TL;DR is that there's [`FORCE_COLOR`](https://petermekhaeil.com/til/add-color-using-force-color/) env variable, which is the opposite of `NO_COLOR`, and it might be nice to support it. \r\n\r\nBackground: I am writing a thing which spawns other processes (like `cargo`) via `std::process::Command`. The thing is definitely _not_ a terminal emulator, so the subprocess stdout is normal pipe, rather than a TTY. My thing is also capable of parsing ANSI escapes, so it would very much like to receive colored output from subprocess. I wold love to have a general, cross-platform way to tell subprocesses \"give me ANSI colors!\" and I would love this not involving ioctl to the kernel (the way ttys work). The `FORCE_COLOR` feels like this solution. \r\n\r\nHowever, there's a problem: unlike `NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR` isn't a \"real standard\". I _think_ this is just a thing that `node` is doing. However, it seems like it at least becomes a de-facto standard. See, for example, the list of references in https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13806 (but, of course, node and python interpret this value differently: `FORCE_COLOR=0` force-disables colors for node, and force-enables colors for Python).
