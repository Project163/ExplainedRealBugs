`attr.evolve` calls to specify correct arguments and types.\r\n\r\nThe implementation makes it so that at every point where `attr.evolve` is called, the signature is modified to expect the attrs class' initializer's arguments (but so that they're all kw-only and optional).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- Added `class dict: pass` to some fixtures files since our attrs type stubs now have **kwargs and that triggers a `builtin.dict` lookup in dozens of attrs tests.\r\n- Looking up the type of the 1st argument with `ctx.api.expr_checker.accept(inst_arg)` which is a hack since it's not part of the plugin

`dataclassses.replace` actual arguments to match the fields:\r\n\r\n- Unlike `__init__`, the arguments are always named.\r\n- All arguments are optional except for `InitVar`s without a default value.\r\n\r\nThe tricks:\r\n- We're looking up type of the first positional argument (\"obj\") through private API. See #10216, #14845.\r\n- We're preparing the signature of \"replace\" (for that specific dataclass) during the dataclass transformation and storing it in a \"private\" class attribute `__mypy-replace` (obviously not part of PEP-557 but contains a hyphen so should not conflict with any future valid identifier). Stashing the signature into the symbol table allows it to be passed across phases and cached across invocations. The stashed signature lacks the first argument, which we prepend at function signature hook time, since it depends on the type that `replace` is called on.\r\n\r\nBased on #14526 but actually simpler.\r\nPartially addresses #5152.\r\n\r\n# Remaining tasks\r\n\r\n- [x] handle generic dataclasses\r\n- [x] avoid data class transforms\r\n- [x] fine-grained mode
