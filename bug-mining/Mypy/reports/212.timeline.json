#13066\r\n\r\nDuring the semanal phase, mypy opts to ignore and skip processing any malformed or illegal statements inside of a TypedDict class definition, such as method definitions.\r\n\r\nSkipping semanal analysis on these statements can cause any number of odd downstream problems: the type-checking phase assumes that all semanal-only semantic constructs (e.g. FakeInfo) have been purged by this point, and so can crash at any point once this precondition has been violated.\r\n\r\nThis diff opts to solve this problem by filtering down the list of statements so we keep only the ones we know are legal within a TypedDict definition.\r\n\r\nThe other possible solution to this problem is to modify mypy so we skip checking TypedDict class bodies entirely during type checking and fine-grained deps analysis. Doing this would also let address #10007 and supersede my other diff #13732.\r\n\r\nI decided against doing this for now because:\r\n\r\n1. I wasn't sure if this was actually safe, especially in the fine-grained deps phase and for mypyc.\r\n2. I think no matter what, the semanal phase should not leak semanal-only types: relaxing this postcondition would make it harder to reason about mypy. So, we'd probably want to make this change regardless of what we do in the later phases.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13963/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/13963/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7704825010,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5NDFuIzwAAAAHLPkyy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7704825010","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-10-31T14:24:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7704825680,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5NDFuIzwAAAAHLPk9Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7704825680","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7569d88d0d650be73070c2536ddc3746d61237dd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/7569d88d0d650be73070c2536ddc3746d61237dd","created_at":"2022-10-31T14:24:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
