tend to think the problem underlying the initial example has nothing to do with loops but with promotions, because both `float` and `int` are involved.\n\nSo, maybe this is a simpler repro:\n\n```python\nx: float | None\ny: int | None\nz: int\nreveal_type(x)  # float | None\nx = y\nreveal_type(x)  # None   !!!!!!!!!\nx = z\nreveal_type(x)  # int\n```\n\nWith \"normal\" subtypes, the same type of type narrowing works:\n\n```python\nclass A: ...\nclass B(A): ...\n\na: A | None\nb: B | None\nc: B\nreveal_type(a)  # A | None\na = b\nreveal_type(a)  # B | None\na = c\nreveal_type(a)  # B\n``` \n\nLikely, an attempt to solve this could start
