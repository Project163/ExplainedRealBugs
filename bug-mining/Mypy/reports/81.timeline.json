PR causes mypy to not show an error if a function named `_` is redefined, as a single underscore is often used as a name for a throwaway function.\r\n\r\nThis handles the case where `_` is used as an alias for `gettext` by differentiating between functions that are aliased as `_` but defined with another name, and functions that are defined as `_`. Overwriting a function named `_` is allowed, but overwriting a function named something else but aliased as `_` is not allowed, which should prevent people from accidentally overwriting `gettext` after importing it.\r\n\r\nThis also turns calling a function named `_` directly into an error, as currently we keep track of the type of the first definition if there are multiple functions defined as `_`, instead of the type of the last definition, and functions are usually not meant to be called directly if they're named `_`.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nI added several tests to

Something like this:\r\n```py\r\ndef _(arg: str) -> int: ...\r\n\r\ndef _(arg: int) -> str: ...\r\n\r\n_('a')\r\n```\r\nis probably a bug for the same reason that redefining a non-underscore function is a bug.\r\n\r\nMaybe the fix for this can be allowing calling underscore functions only when they haven't being redefined.
