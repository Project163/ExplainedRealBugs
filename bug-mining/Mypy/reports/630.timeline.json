Description\r\nThis PR fixes the incorrect usage of the word **\"argument\"** in `stubtest` error messages and replaces it with the correct term **\"parameter\"**, as requested in issue #16508.  \r\n\r\nAccording to convention:\r\n- **Parameter** → part of the function signature\r\n- **Argument** → actual value passed when calling the function  \r\n\r\nSince `stubtest` deals only with *parameters*, this correction improves the accuracy of the error messages.\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\nFixes #16508\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nThis is my **third contribution** to `python` (one of my previous PRs has already been merged 🎉).  \r\nI am still a beginner, so if there are any problems with this PR, please let me know — I’ll be happy to make the necessary fixes.  \r\n\r\n⚠️ I wasn’t able to fully test the changes locally, so I would really appreciate feedback if something needs adjustment.  \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Updated error messages to use correct terminology\r\n- [x] Linked issue fixed (#16508)\r\n- [ ] Local testing (help appreciated if something is missing)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19707/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19707/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19279410946,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc53CuGKzwAAAAR9JHcC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/19279410946","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-22T04:04:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19279965545,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc53CuGKzwAAAAR9LO1p","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/19279965545","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"35a15b1302f3ca97492d5eda1c53b5034c0ba2f4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spencerx/mypy/commits/35a15b1302f3ca97492d5eda1c53b5034c0ba2f4","created_at":"2025-08-22T05:09:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
