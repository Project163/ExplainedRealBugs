According to https://stackoverflow.com/a/71116722/595220, the spec is at https://github.com/cobertura/web/blob/master/htdocs/xml/coverage-04.dtd which has\r\n```console\r\n<!ATTLIST coverage lines-covered    CDATA #REQUIRED>\r\n<!ATTLIST coverage lines-valid      CDATA #REQUIRED>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI haven't checked ll\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nAdd `--cobertura-xml-report` to any MyPy invocation, grab the resulting XML file, and feed it to `irongut/CodeCoverageSummary` @ GHA.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nSpec-compliant tools shouldn't crash when presented with a MyPy-produced coverage XML report advertising its compatibility with the Cobertura standard.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nTools like the `irongut/CodeCoverageSummary` action error out because of missing required XML attributes: https://github.com/irongut/CodeCoverageSummary/issues/324. It fails upon checking for the presence of the `lines-covered` attribute in the `<coverage>` node with `\"Overall lines covered not found\"` in this case. But I looked further into their source code, and I saw that it'd also choke on missing `lines-valid` with `\"Overall lines valid not found\"`.\r\n\r\nI haven't checked any further but it might be a good idea to check the implementation against anything marked as `#REQUIRED` in said DTD spec.\r\n\r\n**Extra research**\r\n\r\nLooking into https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/fe15ee6/mypy/report.py#L597, it seems to me that the values that could be mapped to the missing attributes are already present in the class and the mapping should be straightforward:\r\n```\r\nself.total_lines -> lines-valid\r\nself.covered_lines -> lines-covered\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/17689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
