Make sure the cache is cold\r\n$ mypy a.py b.py\r\nSuccess: no issues found in 2 source files\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow edit b.py adding one line at the end for example:\r\n```python\r\nfrom a import AttrsInstance, Foo\r\nfrom typing import Type\r\n\r\nthing: Type[AttrsInstance] = Foo \r\nprint(thing)\r\n\r\nfoo = False\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd re-run mypy, getting error unrelated to the change!\r\n```bash\r\n$ mypy a.py b.py\r\nb.py:4: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"Type[Foo]\", variable has type \"Type[AttrsInstance]\")  [assignment]\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 2 source files)\r\n```\r\n\r\nDeleting the cache makes it work again:\r\n```bash\r\n$ rm -r .mypy_cache/\r\n$ mypy a.py b.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that we also get an error if using `AttrsInstance` directly instead of `Type[AttrsInstance]`:\r\n\r\nUsing this b.py:\r\n```Python\r\nfrom a import AttrsInstance, Foo\r\nfrom typing import Type\r\n\r\nthing: AttrsInstance = Foo(\"bar\")\r\nprint(thing)\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults in this after a similar edit to b.py:\r\n```\r\n(virtualenv) thomas@thomas-xps13:~/Projects/test$ mypy a.py b.py\r\nb.py:4: error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type \"Foo\", variable has type \"AttrsInstance\")  [assignment]\r\nb.py:4: note: Protocol member AttrsInstance.__attrs_attrs__ expected class variable, got instance variable\r\nb.py:4: note: Protocol member AttrsInstance.__attrs_attrs__ expected settable variable, got read-only attribute\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 2 source files)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nProgram should still typecheck correctly with warm cache.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nProgram fails to typecheck.
