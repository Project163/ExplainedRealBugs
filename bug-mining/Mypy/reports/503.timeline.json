Even though `str` provides a custom `__bool__` method at runtime the typeshed stubs don't represent that, so the only `__bool__` method the trutyness check finds is the one on `EnumType` which is always `True`.\r\n\r\nCase in point, the bug disappears if you use `IntEnum`, where `int` also provides its own `__bool__`.\r\n\r\nSo it's not really a true regression, the old broken behavior happened to be accidentally correct for `StrEnum`, because it used the enum value for determining truthyness, which is only correct for `StrEnum` and `IntEnum`.\r\n\r\nWe could probably slightly improve the behavior for `StrEnum` and `IntEnum` by special-casing them, so we statically determine that an `IntEnum` member with value `0` is always falsey and every other value is always truthy and the same for `StrEnum` with the empty string vs. any other string. But I'm not fully convinced it's worth the extra complication, since we would need to detect any custom enum subclass that inherits from either `str` or `int` without overriding `__bool__` somewhere along the way.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2565157345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Daverball","id":5726519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjY1MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5726519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball","html_url":"https://github.com/Daverball","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2565161389","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/18376#issuecomment-2565161389","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18376","id":2565161389,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc6Y5UGt","user":{"login":"Daverball","id":5726519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjY1MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5726519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball","html_url":"https://github.com/Daverball","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daverball/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-30T08:22:35Z","updated_at":"2024-12-30T08:22:35Z","body":"Hmm, actually `str`'s trutyhness relies on `__len__` rather than `__bool__`, so there is actually no `__bool__`.
