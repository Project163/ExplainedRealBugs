Since typeshed runs checks against 3.7, this should not\r\ncause testing regressions for typeshed.\r\n\r\nThis code goes back to #3000 back in the typed_ast days, when this\r\nallowed stubs to use

installed in a python 3.10 docker container fails to parse a `.pyi` file with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/numpy/__init__.pyi:636: error: Positional-only parameters are only supported in Python 3.8 and greater\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (errors prevented further checking)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. `docker run -it --rm python:3.10 bash`\r\n2. `pip install numpy mypy`\r\n3. Create a test.py with:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy\r\n```\r\n4. Run `mypy test.py`\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nI expect mypy to be able to parse this `.pyi` file successfully given that it is being run from a python 3.10 interpreter. The error fails because it attempts to parse it with an incompatible version that does not have positional-only parameters.\r\n\r\nI am also unable to squash this error because it seems to happen at a stage where errors can't be silenced.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nThe above error occurs. I have tested that this error does not occur in python 3.9. It occurs across multiple operating systems including MacOS and Linux, across both amd64 and arm64 architectures, across multiple versions of mypy, and multiple versions of numpy\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 0.971\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: None\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): None\r\n- Python version used: 3.10\r\n-
