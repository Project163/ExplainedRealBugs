then this will be not easy to fix. The problem is that you have that big union of 40 items. Previously mypy didn't support recursive types, so most likely all recursive types were either plain `Any` or shallow TypedDicts with `Any`. Mypy used to give an error about this however. I guess this error was not shown because `pydantic_core` is checked as third party dependency? You can try `--no-silence-site-packages` when using `--disable-recursive-aliases`. (Btw everything on `PYTHONPATH` is considered third party, cc @JukkaL)\r\n\r\nSo now when recursive types are properly supported imagine you have a triple nested dictionary typed as `CoreSchema`. Mypy will need to try every item in the union until it finds a matching one. This will take on average 20 * 20 * 20 = 8000 type checks for a single dict. To make things worse, TypedDicts are structural, and some have overlapping keys so it may take a while to figure out that a given item doesn't actually match.\r\n\r\nWe will still try to profile this. Maybe there is some room for optimizations.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1307147893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7762315186,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAGuhRc5V1LHUzwAAAAHOq4ey","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7762315186","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-08T12:37:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7762315197,"node_id":"SE_lADOAGuhRc5V1LHUzwAAAAHOq4e9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7762315197","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-08T12:37:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1307160247","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14034#issuecomment-1307160247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14034","id":1307160247,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5N6a63","user":{"login":"samuelcolvin","id":4039449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMzk0NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4039449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin","html_url":"https://github.com/samuelcolvin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/samuelcolvin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-08T12:45:39Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T12:45:39Z","body":"Thanks so much for the explanation.\r\n\r\nSimple answer might be to move to pyright, which we already use to check pydantic-core and seems to do a reasonably good job (although that union found a bug in pyright too). (I don't mean this to sound hostile, mypy is amazing and I'd love to continue to use it, but I understand if this is a fundamental limitation of the library)\r\n\r\nIf it helps, all those TypedDicts have a `type` key which can (mostly) be used as a discriminator - that's how we validate pydantic-core schema using pydantic-core, see [here](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/blob/463ed7aa83b08c43bc699e7e5380026551e38876/src/validators/union.rs#L318-L361).

https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/14627\r\n\r\nTrying to run mypy with pydantic `2.0.0.dev.0` hangs when trying to lint\r\n```py\r\n# test.py\r\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe likely reason for that is the `CoreSchema` type. Mypy can't handle unions with a lot of items that well. Especially for TypedDicts, it tries to find a common base type but when there is none, checks the compatibility of each keys individually.\r\n\r\nThat's even more of an issue as there are also some recursive annotations with `CoreSchema`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/blob/bfb373c269ae2bfcc32c15e4f1e59f2cee30b2ac/pydantic_core/core_schema.py#L2547-L2588\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/blob/bfb373c269ae2bfcc32c15e4f1e59f2cee30b2ac/pydantic_core/core_schema.py#L1724-L1726\r\n\r\nTo improve mypy performance, I added an empty `CoreSchemaBase` TypedDict type from which all `CoreSchema` types can inherit and replaced the recursive `CoreSchema` types. With that a mypy run is back down to 15-20s.\r\n```\r\ntime mypy --no-incremental

this is a very unfortunate situation, is there anything you could do to help?\r\n\r\nEven if you had a hack to automatically ignore the `pydantic_core` package (e.g. treat it like it has no `py.typed`

[this](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/blob/main/pydantic_core/core_schema.py) which is very important to pydantic, but kills
