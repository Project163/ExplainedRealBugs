have subclass methods that differ in this way.

with OtherParent/OtherChild).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/9254/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/9254/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"sobolevn","id":4660275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjAyNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4660275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn","html_url":"https://github.com/sobolevn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sobolevn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-23T10:19:06Z","updated_at":"2023-06-23T10:19:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15503","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15503/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15503/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15503/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15503","id":1771203874,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGuhRc5TvBrY","number":15503,"title":"Support
