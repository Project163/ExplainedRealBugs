Report**\r\n\r\n`type: ignore[import-untyped]` leaves a note that must be silenced with `type: ignore[import]`, but only for one of the locations.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nConsider two files, a.py and b.py, both with this content:\r\n```python\r\nimport sentencepiece\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince sentencepiece is a third-party package without type information, mypy complains:\r\n```\r\n$ mypy *.py\r\nb.py:1: error: Skipping analyzing \"sentencepiece\": module is installed, but missing library stubs or py.typed marker  [import-untyped]\r\na.py:1: error: Skipping analyzing \"sentencepiece\": module is installed, but missing library stubs or py.typed marker  [import-untyped]\r\na.py:1: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#missing-imports\r\nFound 2 errors in 2 files (checked 2 source files)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, let's try to shut up mypy, since our project can't do anything to fix that issue internally. First, I tried using disabled_error_codes in mypy.ini, and was met with issue #16002. Then, I tried adding `type: ignore` comments, like this:\r\n```python\r\nimport sentencepiece  # type: ignore[import-untyped]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't really work:\r\n```\r\n$ mypy *.py\r\na.py:1: note: See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/running_mypy.html#missing-imports\r\na.py:1: note: Error code \"import\" not covered by \"type: ignore\" comment\r\nSuccess: no issues found in 2 source files\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor one file only, mypy leaves a note providing a link to the documentation, with no associated error message.\r\n\r\nThis can be worked around by using `type: ignore[import]` on the line it complains about, but I don't know if that has to be done for just one of the files or all of them, and how mypy decides which one. I also don't want to hide other kinds of import errors, such as a package being missing entirely, or stubs that are available but not installed.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: `mypy 1.7.0+dev.9a0aca14724eeef580eefcd3b340678313a1930a (compiled: no)`\r\n- Python version used: Python 3.11.3\r\n- Operating system and version: Arch Linux","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16003/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16003/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10238112480,"node_id":"LE_lADOAGuhRc5vuHM-zwAAAAJiPTLg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/10238112480","actor":{"login":"AlexWaygood","id":66076021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDc2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66076021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexWaygood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-08-30T23:03:17Z","label":{"name":"topic-configuration","color":"17E2A3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1700395406","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/16002#issuecomment-1700395406","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16002","id":1700395406,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5lWfmO","user":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-31T05:35:46Z","updated_at":"2023-08-31T05:35:46Z","body":"Oh lol, the option name is \"disable_error_code\", but because of annoying reasons mypy's config parsing sort of accepts the other phrasing.
