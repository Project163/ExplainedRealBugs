Using the mypy daemon and type checking different files makes it crash. Trying to make excerpt files for demonstrating the issue, I also found that I would encounter `AssertionError: Must not defer during final iteration` if I had the setup slightly different.\r\n\r\n**Traceback**\r\n\r\nIf you type check `main.py` and then type check `with_trio.py`, you get this traceback from the log
