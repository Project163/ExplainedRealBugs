Add type inference for `dict.keys` membership\r\n\r\n    Also for containership checks on `typing.KeysView.` This is to bring the\r\n    following cases into alignment:\r\n\r\n        from typing import KeysView\r\n\r\n        key: str | None\r\n        d: dict[str, int]\r\n        kv: KeysView[str]\r\n\r\n        if key in d:\r\n            # type of 'key' is inferred to be 'str'\r\n

`test-data/unit/fixtures/dict.pyi` doesn't include `dict.keys`, and\r\n    adding it requires importing `dict_keys` from `_collections_abc` in\r\n    those stubs, which then requires adding `_collections_abc.pyi` stubs,\r\n    which would have to be complete since e.g.\r\n    `testGenericAliasCollectionsABCReveal` expects most of the types in\r\n    those stubs to be defined (this is the same approach as\r\n    7678f28f65cf6e878cacd5ba663e6e54347653ae).\r\n\r\n    GH: issue #13360\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nTest added under
