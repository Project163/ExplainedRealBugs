Report**\r\n\r\nA regression bug has been identified in `mypy` version 1.11.1, where the use of `typing.Self` in class method factory functions triggers an error. This issue does not occur in `mypy` version 1.10.0. Specifically, attempting to use `functools.partial` with `typing.Self` results in the error: `\"type[Self]\" not callable`. \r\n\r\n_Description generated using AI._ \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Create `t.py` file with the following content down below.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport functools, time, typing\r\n\r\n\r\nclass LogEntry:\r\n    def __init__(self, ts: float, msg: str) -> None:\r\n        self.ts = ts\r\n        self.msg = msg\r\n\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    async def from_msg_self_typed(cls, msg: str) -> typing.Self:\r\n        factory = functools.partial(cls, ts=time.time())  # Fails here with: \"type[Self]\" not callable\r\n        return factory(msg=msg)\r\n\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    async def from_msg_class_typed(cls, msg: str) -> \"LogEntry\":\r\n        factory = functools.partial(cls, ts=time.time())  # Works fine\r\n        return factory(msg=msg)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run `mypy t.py`\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nNo errors.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pip install mypy==1.10.0\r\n$ mypy t.py\r\nSuccess: no issues found in 1 source file\r\n\r\n$ pip install mypy==1.11.1\r\nt.py:11: error: \"type[Self]\" not callable  [misc]\r\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mypy
