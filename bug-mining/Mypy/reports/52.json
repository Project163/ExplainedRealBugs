Here's a simplified example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Callable, TypeVar, Generic, TypeGuard, Any, List, Optional, overload\r\n\r\n_T = TypeVar('_T')\r\n\r\nclass filter(Generic[_T]):\r\n    @overload\r\n    def __init__(self, __function: Callable[[object], TypeGuard[_T]]) -> None: ...\r\n    @overload\r\n    def __init__(self, __function: Callable[[_T], Any]) -> None: ...\r\n\r\n# Demo:\r\n\r\na: List[Optional[int]]\r\ndef is_int_typeguard(a: object) -> TypeGuard[int]: pass\r\ndef returns_bool(a: object) -> bool: pass\r\n\r\n# Ok:\r\nreveal_type(filter(is_int_typeguard))  # N: Revealed type is \"ex.filter[builtins.int*]\"\r\n\r\n# Not ok:\r\nreveal_type(filter(returns_bool))  # N: Revealed type is \"ex.filter[builtins.bool*]\"\r\n# Expected: Revealed type is \"ex.filter[builtins.object*]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some reason `bool` matches `TypeGuard[_T]` and infers `_T` to be `bool`. I think that `TypeGuard` here is more specific type than just `bool` and this match should not happen.","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11307/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11307/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
