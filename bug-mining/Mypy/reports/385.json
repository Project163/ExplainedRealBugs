it's just that the typeshed change exposed a previously-hidden Mypy issue.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# run with --python-version=3.9 or below, using mypy d11db28 or 1.4 or later\r\n\r\nfrom typing_extensions import NewType\r\n\r\nN = NewType(\"N\", int)\r\n\r\nx: N  # error: Variable \"eg_newtype.N\" is not valid as a type  [valid-type]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nMypy passes this example.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**\r\n\r\nMypy fails this example; see above.\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 1.6.1 (compiled) and current master (uncompiled)\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: `--python-version=3.9`\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): none (i.e. using vendored typeshed)\r\n- Python version used: 3.12\r\n\r\n<!-- You can freely edit this text, please remove all the lines you believe are unnecessary. -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/16297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
