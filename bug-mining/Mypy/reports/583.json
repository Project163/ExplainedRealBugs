One of the `__init__` overloads specifies the type of `self` in order to control what the type variable evaluates to for this overload.\n\nWhen I upgraded this code to Mypy 1.16, I started getting errors in a method that uses `isinstance` to check whether another object is an instance of the same class. I expected `if isinstance(other, A):` to narrow the type of `other` to `A[Any]`, but it actually narrows to the self-type specified in the first `__init__` overload, such as `A[int]`.\n\nIf I reorder the `__init__` overloads so the first overload does not specify a self-type, then `if isinstance(other, A):` seems to narrow to `A[Any]`, or `A[T]` in methods that take a union of `A[T]` and other types. This is the behavior I expected.\n\nWith Mypy 1.15 and older, the behavior is different. Specifying a self-type for the first `__init__` overload causes `if isinstance(other, A):` to narrow the type of `other` to `Never`. I think this is why I didn't get any errors before upgrading to Mypy 1.16.\n\nPyright doesn't complain about this code.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\nClasses A and B are the same except for the order of the `__init__` overloads.\n\nhttps://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.12&gist=dae546cdc2f11d2f5bd582efa826e188\n```python\nfrom typing import Generic, TypeVar, overload\n\nT = TypeVar(\"T\")\n\nclass A(Generic[T]):\n    @overload\n    def __init__(self, x: T) -> None: ...\n\n    @overload\n    def __init__(self: A[int]) -> None: ...\n\n    def __init__(self, x: T | None = None) -> None:\n        pass\n    \n    def f(self, other: A[T] | str) -> None:\n        reveal_type(other) # Union[__main__.A[T`1], builtins.str]\n        if isinstance(other, A):\n            reveal_type(other) # __main__.A[T`1]\n        else:\n            raise TypeError\n\nclass B(Generic[T]):\n    @overload\n    def __init__(self: B[int]) -> None: ...\n\n    @overload\n    def __init__(self, x: T) -> None: ...\n\n    def __init__(self, x: T | None = None) -> None:\n        pass\n    \n    def f(self, other: B[T] | str) -> None:\n        reveal_type(other) # Union[__main__.B[T`1], builtins.str]\n        if isinstance(other, B):\n            reveal_type(other) # __main__.B[builtins.int]\n        else:\n            raise TypeError\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\n```\nmain.py:16: note: Revealed type is \"Union[__main__.A[T`1], builtins.str]\"\nmain.py:18: note: Revealed type is \"__main__.A[T`1]\"\nmain.py:33: note: Revealed type is \"Union[__main__.B[T`1], builtins.str]\"\nmain.py:35: note: Revealed type is \"__main__.B[T`1]\"\n```\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\nMypy 1.16:\n```\nmain.py:16: note: Revealed type is \"Union[__main__.A[T`1], builtins.str]\"\nmain.py:18: note: Revealed type is \"__main__.A[T`1]\"\nmain.py:33: note: Revealed type is \"Union[__main__.B[T`1], builtins.str]\"\nmain.py:35: note: Revealed type is \"__main__.B[builtins.int]\"\n```\n\nMypy 1.15:\n```\nmain.py:16: note: Revealed type is \"Union[__main__.A[T`1], builtins.str]\"\nmain.py:18: note: Revealed type is \"__main__.A[T`1]\"\nmain.py:33: note: Revealed type is \"Union[__main__.B[T`1], builtins.str]\"\nmain.py:35: note: Revealed type is \"Never\"\n```\n\n**Your Environment**\n\n- Mypy version used: 1.16\n- Mypy command-line flags: none\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): `strict=true`, but it's also reproducible with none\n- Python version used: 3.12\n","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19221/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
