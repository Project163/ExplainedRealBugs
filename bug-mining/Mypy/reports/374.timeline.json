But it looks like an unfortunate side effect is that it now _only_ accepts `@dataclass` instances being passed to `dataclasses.replace()`, whereas the runtime function `dataclasses.replace()` accepts anything with a `__dataclass_fields__` dictionary `ClassVar`.\r\n\r\n@ikonst, would it be possible to just fallback to the signature typeshed gives if mypy sees an instance of a class that hasn't been constructed with `@dataclass` being passed to `dataclasses.replace()`? This issue is also causing one of typeshed's tests to fail: see the commented-out test in https://github.com/python/typeshed/pull/10559.\r\n\r\n(It's not a huge issue for typeshed, though, we can just comment out the test for now and that's not the end of the world.)","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1674573194/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AlexWaygood","id":66076021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDc2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66076021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexWaygood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10068496851,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAGuhRc5uA8lvzwAAAAJYIRHT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/10068496851","actor":{"login":"ikonst","id":1186084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1186084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst","html_url":"https://github.com/ikonst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-08-11T11:04:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10068496864,"node_id":"SE_lADOAGuhRc5uA8lvzwAAAAJYIRHg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/10068496864","actor":{"login":"ikonst","id":1186084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1186084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst","html_url":"https://github.com/ikonst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-08-11T11:04:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1674581371","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/15843#issuecomment-1674581371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15843","id":1674581371,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5j0BV7","user":{"login":"NeilGirdhar","id":730137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDEzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar","html_url":"https://github.com/NeilGirdhar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-11T11:12:49Z","updated_at":"2023-08-11T11:12:49Z","body":"(Although,

And if so, how easily can they be made compatible?\r\n\r\nTo make them compatible, I propsed using dispatch, but registration of a replace/field method might be another alternative.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1690333132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NeilGirdhar","id":730137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDEzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar","html_url":"https://github.com/NeilGirdhar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1694952679","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/15843#issuecomment-1694952679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15843","id":1694952679,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5lBuzn","user":{"login":"ikonst","id":1186084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1186084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst","html_url":"https://github.com/ikonst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-28T03:33:43Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T03:33:43Z","body":"If I understand correctly, the Data Class Transforms mechanism was introduced **not** to create \"custom data classes\" (a runtime concept) but to let 3rd party libs tell mypy & pyright how to understand a custom type without having to write a plugin (a typing concept). That's why it's `@typing.dataclass_transform` and not `@dataclasses.transform`.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that [PEP-681](https://peps.python.org/pep-0681/) was misunderstood and/or its use evolves differently than planned. Using [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+%40dataclass_transform+-file:typing.py+-file:typing_extensions.py&patternType=standard&sm=1&groupBy=repo), I found them split into multiple categories:\r\n\r\n* **as PEP-681 intended**: attrs, pydantic, [flax](https://github.com/google/flax)\r\n* **wraps `dataclasses`**: [pyserde](https://github.com/yukinarit/pyserde), [strawberry](https://github.com/strawberry-graphql/strawberry), [ibis](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis)\r\n* **custom impl dataclass**: n/a (couldn't find any)\r\n\r\nBy \"wraps dataclasses\", I mean that they make a `my_dataclass` decorator calling into actual `dataclasses` so what they produce follows the dataclasses semantics, but since it's no longer decorated with `@dataclasses.dataclass`, naive type checkers wouldn't treat it specially. And then `@typing.dataclass_transform` comes to the rescue. PEP-681 doesn't seem to foresee this really common use case.\r\n\r\nre pydantic, unlike what's been said in the thread, I didn't see it produce a `__dataclass_fields__` in runtime:\r\n```python\r\nimport dataclasses\r\nimport pydantic\r\nfrom typing import reveal_type\r\n\r\n\r\nclass User(pydantic.BaseModel):\r\n    name: str\r\n    age: int\r\n\r\n\r\nuser =

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n## My summary\r\n\r\n- There's fewer folks than we expected wanting to implement something custom that doesn't borrow from `dataclasses` yet compatible with `dataclassses.replace` etc.\r\n- There's many more people that simply want such constructs to preserve type-checking special treatment, and this is probably the main behavior that we should avoid breaking, even though it wasn't foreseen in PEP-681.\r\n  ```python\r\n  @typing.dataclass_transform()\r\n  def my_dataclass(kls):\r\n    kls.foo = 'bar'\r\n    return dataclasses.dataclass(kls)\r\n

Are we promising only fields or the dataclass interface (replace, fields, etc.).\r\n\r\nRight now, it promises that, quoting PEP-681, \"certain decorator functions, classes, and metaclasses provide behaviors similar to dataclasses\".\r\n\r\n> What is the best way to make custom dataclasses support the dataclass interface?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'd start off with \"custom dataclasses\" since there's scant evidence anyone is doing it. For example, pydantic is very close to what I'd call a \"custom dataclass\" and it never bothered emulating dataclasses for runtime purposes. Focusing on \"Wraps dataclasses\" makes for a stronger case.\r\n\r\n> If a custom base class...\r\n\r\nThe path of least resistance is to simply add a parameter to `dataclass_transform`. PEP-681 says it could be done without another PEP: \"In the future, we may add additional parameters to dataclass_transform as needed to support common behaviors in user code. These additions will be made after reaching consensus on typing-sig rather than via additional PEPs.\"\r\n\r\nThen the question of whether `dataclasses` should offer a base class becomes totally orthogonal to this discussion. (PEP-681 is fine with both decorators, base classes and meta classes.)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1695896735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ikonst","id":1186084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODYwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1186084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst","html_url":"https://github.com/ikonst","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ikonst/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1696072014","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/15843#issuecomment-1696072014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15843","id":1696072014,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5lGAFO","user":{"login":"NeilGirdhar","id":730137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDEzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar","html_url":"https://github.com/NeilGirdhar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeilGirdhar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-28T17:27:51Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T17:29:08Z","body":"> The path of least resistance is to simply add a parameter to `dataclass_transform`.\r\n\r\nThat would perfectly satisfy me.
