Description\r\n\r\nI was planning on adding a ParamSpec-based interface to something I'm making but... it turns out I need `Concatenate` and `Z[[int]]` syntax.\r\n\r\nCloses #11833 \r\nCloses #12276 (needs test)\r\nCloses #12257 (needs test; not sure how to test cache issues)\r\nRefs #8645 \r\nExternal ref https://github.com/python/typeshed/issues/4827\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `Parameters` proper type to represent parameters (more later in this description), along with adding a `Concatenate` operator.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nI copied all (seemingly relevant) tests from PEP 612. I plan on copying test cases from issues and thinking of a few of my own later.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n(not a real section but seemed important enough)\r\n\r\n - `Concatenate` support does *not* use a `ProperType`. That would be too much new code for an operator, in my opinion. Thus, it prepends to a `ParamSpecType`'s `.prefix`.\r\n - I would really *really* like `CallableType` to take in a `parameters: ParamSpecType | Parameters` -- this would simplify some code, and it fits better in your head. However, this would be a breaking change, so I did not do this (along with the fact that making basic changes in this direction led to 300 type errors when self-checking).\r\n~~- `Concatenate` was *super* unspecified by the PEP in my opinion. I ended up making it work wherever `ParamSpec` could be (or so I think)... Which means `Concatenate[int, Concatenate[str, P]]` works!~~\r\n - Error messages could be improved, but I'm not sure where I can get the context to improve those.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11847/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":6,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11847/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1071892414","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11855#issuecomment-1071892414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11855","id":1071892414,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc4_48e-","user":{"login":"cdce8p","id":30130371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTMwMzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30130371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p","html_url":"https://github.com/cdce8p","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdce8p/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-18T00:16:53Z","updated_at":"2022-03-18T00:16:53Z","body":"Another example with `Concatenate` inside a Type Alias.

bound type variables. Then I can essentially simply share (or copy in one small place, to avoid cyclic imports) all the logic that currently exists for `ParamSpec` and `Concatenate` in `expand_type()` etc.\r\n\r\nThis will also address a big piece of tech debt, and will get some benefits (almost) for free, such as checking bounds/values for alias type variables, and much tighter handling of unbound type variables.\r\n\r\nNote that in this PR I change logic for emitting some errors, I try to avoid showing multiple errors for the same location/reason. But this is not an essential part of this PR (it is just some test cases would otherwise fail with even more error messages), I can reconsider if there are objections.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14159/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":9,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/14159/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7885166624,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5A8k4DzwAAAAHV_hgg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7885166624","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-24T11:22:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7885167044,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5A8k4DzwAAAAHV_hnE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/7885167044","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"13bd201586e837962239dbdca8eda1f9966ebfc2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/13bd201586e837962239dbdca8eda1f9966ebfc2","created_at":"2022-11-24T11:22:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1342501305","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11855#issuecomment-1342501305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11855","id":1342501305,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5QBPG5","user":{"login":"RRRajput","id":46224135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjI0MTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46224135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RRRajput","html_url":"https://github.com/RRRajput","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RRRajput/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RRRajput/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RRRajput/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RRRajput/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RRRajput/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RRRajput/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RRRajput/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RRRajput/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RRRajput/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-08T10:37:34Z","updated_at":"2022-12-08T10:37:34Z","body":"Is there any information on when this fix would be available?

It seems weird that one has to go this roundabout way, as neither `Callable[[int, ...], None]`, nor `Callable[Concatenate[int, ...], None]` are supported.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1423227588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"randolf-scholz","id":39696536,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njk2NTM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39696536?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz","html_url":"https://github.com/randolf-scholz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8472947578,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAGuhRc5A8k4DzwAAAAH5But6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/8472947578","actor":{"login":"erictraut","id":7040122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDAxMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7040122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut","html_url":"https://github.com/erictraut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-08T20:56:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8472947588,"node_id":"SE_lADOAGuhRc5A8k4DzwAAAAH5BuuE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/8472947588","actor":{"login":"erictraut","id":7040122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDAxMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7040122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut","html_url":"https://github.com/erictraut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erictraut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-08T20:56:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
