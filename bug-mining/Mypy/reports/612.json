NotImplementedError\n```\n\n\n---\n\nanother way to trigger this crash is through a typo in the variadic type parameter name:\n\n```pyi\nclass MyTuple[*Ts](tuple[*_Ts]): ...  # oh no a typo\n```\n\nthis produces an identical stacktrace ([mypy-play](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.13&gist=d690a693b10435804af10f9ed9a270c4))\n\n---\n\nsome observations:\n\n- it doesn't matter if `typing.Unpack` is used instead of `*`\n- I checked all versions from 1.9.0-master, and all crash in the same way\n- `class S(tuple[()]): ...` does not cause a crash \n  (although `S()` is [revealed as](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.13&gist=08f4af8a360ea5b743c0c49bce719052) `tuple[(), fallback=__main__.S]`, which is kinda sus)\n- in case you didn't notice; the first example is valid at runtime, the second isn't\n- my ear is a bit itchy\n\nAnd it's probably not what you want to hear, but it might be relevant info, so I'll carefully whisper it: <sub>Pyright does not have this problem ([playground 1](https://pyright-play.net/?pythonVersion=3.14&strict=true&code=MYGwhgzhAEDKAUAXArgBxAUwNoCoXu3gEoBdEogLmgDpaAoIA), [playground
