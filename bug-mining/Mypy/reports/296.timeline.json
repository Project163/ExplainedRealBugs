one is *chonky*\r\nI might go over it tomorrow and add review comments to help reviewing it. Although there's not really much to do other than grind through it - and running it on existing code, I wouldn't be shocked if there's crashes or bugs that didn't exist before, so maybe do that before releasing.\r\n\r\nI generally optimized for minimizing the diff, rather than writing the best / most logical code - might leave that for a second commit, or do it when implementing autofix. Esp any `isinstance`s should generally not be there when working against libcst.\r\n\r\nI rewrote the loop checker to not require two passes, by injecting a fake statement and doing some fancy logic. Quite happy I came up with this solution, much better than the previous super messy one.\r\nRemoving redundant checkpoints might be more doable with this approach as well.\r\nHaving to access metadata to get the linenos of nodes is quite ugly, with the redundant checkpoint I'll be looking to store nodes instead of `Statement`s in `uncheckpointed_statements`\r\n\r\ntest_910_permutations is now *extremely* slow, previously being so fast I never noticed it, but now it takes *50 seconds* on my machine. I did some rudimentary timing, and the `parse_module` call took 5 of the seconds, and plugin.run() taking 45 seconds. Now that is across ~4000 calls, so nothing too crazy, but I'll probably put it behind `--runfuzz` if I don't find anything responsible for the slowdown. 91X currently doesn't use any decorator markers, so changing it to be a simple transformer might do wonders.\r\n\r\nA few changes in eval_files:\r\n1. realized that comprehensions aren't handled, added regression tests.\r\n2. I think the nested error test ... was wrong? I don't see why that should give two errors per line.\r\n3. multiple yields in a single boolop is no longer handled as before. I maybe should've just done `fmt: off` instead of fighting over and over with black/shed","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-trio/flake8-async/issues/143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-trio/flake8-async/issues/143/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8752367736,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5fBnKbzwAAAAIJroh4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/8752367736","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-15T08:17:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8752367852,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5fBnKbzwAAAAIJrojs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/8752367852","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9cb4872c2c8ab8a4d8a97fcc902b2c7deb268569","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/9cb4872c2c8ab8a4d8a97fcc902b2c7deb268569","created_at":"2023-03-15T08:17:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
