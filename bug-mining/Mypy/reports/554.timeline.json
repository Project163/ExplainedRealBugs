Checking our entire source repo of 2,952 files takes ~2 minutes, and then re-checking a single file (which has not been modified, was already checked, and had its errors reported in the first run) takes nearly a minute. This seems very surprising. (I'd expect this to be near instant, given the file has not been modified since the initial check?)\r\n2. This crash only seems to happen if `scratch.py` has an error it it. If I 'fix' the error in that file, the crash does not occur, though the curiosity of re-checking the individual file taking nearly a minute remains.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n- Mypy version used: 1.3.0\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): _Can repro with empty mypy.ini_\r\n- Python version used: 3.11.3\r\n- Operating system and version: Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.3 (Ootpa)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15486/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15486/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/2591097491","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/18396#issuecomment-2591097491","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18396","id":2591097491,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc6acQKT","user":{"login":"gerner","id":114309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDMwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerner","html_url":"https://github.com/gerner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-14T21:03:06Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T21:03:06Z","body":"I ran into the same issue and posted my problem to #15486. @hauntsaninja suggested it's actually this bug. I did a bisect and determined that I don't get the crash in 1.13.0 but I do get the crash in 1.14.0\n\nThe behavior I see is that from a fresh `dmypy restart` I can run `dmypy run` twice successfully and then I get a crash with the following stack trace on the third run. This is 100% reproduceable on this code base, you'll have to introduce a syntax/type error of some sort. I try not to check those in :) \n\nhttps://github.com/gerner/stellarpunk/tree/87748840624727e521b7641bd947b17f71ca061d\n\n```\ndmypy run\nsrc/stellarpunk/intel.py:307: error: INTERNAL ERROR -- Please
