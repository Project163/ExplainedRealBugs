Interestingly, there doesn't seem a problem for `list`.\r\n\r\n- ex11093/test3.py\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom typing import Dict, List\r\n\r\nD1 = dict[str, str]\r\nD2 = Dict[str, str]\r\nx1 = D1()\r\nx2 = D2()\r\nx3 = dict[str, str]()\r\n\r\nL1 = list[str]\r\nL2 = List[str]\r\ny1 = L1()\r\ny2 = L2()\r\ny3 = list[str]()\r\n```\r\n\r\n- command\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ mypy --show-error-codes ex11093/test3.py \r\nex11093/test3.py:5: error: Need type annotation for \"x1\" (hint: \"x1: Dict[<type>, <type>] = ...\")  [var-annotated]\r\nex11093/test3.py:6: error: Need type annotation for \"x2\" (hint: \"x2: Dict[<type>, <type>] = ...\")  [var-annotated]\r\nFound 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUPDATE (1):\r\nThis issue might be partially due to `SemanticAnalyzer.translate_dict_call` where this kind of translation doesn't happen for `list` builtin.\r\nhttps://github.com/python/mypy/blob/492739692206f05347c6706cb982115446ba552a/mypy/semanal.py#L3813\r\n\r\nNot sure yet but this translation is to support `TypedDict` construction like this? I commented out `translate_dict_call` and the first test failure I got is this.\r\nhttps://github.com/python/mypy/blob/492739692206f05347c6706cb982115446ba552a/test-data/unit/check-typeddict.test#L14-L17\r\n\r\nLooking at PEP589, it seems it actually doesn't allow such construction of TypedDict https://github.com/python/peps/blob/master/pep-0589.rst?plain=1#L210-L212\r\n\r\n> It can be used as a callable object with keyword arguments corresponding to the TypedDict items. Non-keyword arguments are not allowed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUPDATE (2):\r\nThe reason why `Dict[str, str]()` works is that such expression actually won't get translated by `translate_dict_call` due to its AST:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCallExpr:2(\r\n  TypeApplication:2(\r\n    NameExpr(Dict [typing.Dict])\r\n    Types(\r\n      builtins.str\r\n      builtins.str))\r\n

Description\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11093\r\n\r\nI explained what I analyzed about the issue in the comment https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11093#issuecomment-932667550, so I would appreciate if someone could take a loot at it together with this PR.\r\n\r\nClearly, my fix is nothing but a workaround for the specific case in the issue, but surprisingly there is no regression in exisiting tests. So, I made this PR anyway as a starting point to ask some opinions about the issue itself. (Also, maybe CI will show me some regression).\r\n\r\nIt's highly likely that I'm missing some important use of `SemanticAnalyzer.translate_dict_call`, but I couldn't figure it out by myself.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the review!\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf this is a documentation change, rebuild the docs (link to instructions) and review the changed pages for markup errors.\r\nIf this is a code change, include new tests (link to the testing docs). Be sure to run the tests locally and fix any errors before submitting the PR (more instructions).\r\nIf this change cannot be tested by the CI, please explain how to verify it manually.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added new tests in `check-type-aliases.test`:\r\n\r\n- `testTypeAliasDictNoVarAnnotatedError`,\r\n- `testTypeAliasListNoVarAnnotatedError`.\r\n\r\nI think the relevant existing tests are mostly in `check-typeddict.test` and especially this test case:\r\n\r\n- `testCanCreateTypedDictInstanceWithDictCall`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6270086982,"node_id":"LE_lADOAGuhRc47P1xOzwAAAAF1ue9G","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6270086982","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-19T16:13:48Z","label":{"name":"topic-pep-585","color":"1d76db"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6311862050,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAGuhRc47P1xOzwAAAAF4N18i","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6311862050","actor":{"login":"AlexWaygood","id":66076021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDc2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66076021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexWaygood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-26T14:14:05Z","label":{"name":"topic-pep-585","color":"1d76db"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6311862052,"node_id":"LE_lADOAGuhRc47P1xOzwAAAAF4N18k","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/6311862052","actor":{"login":"AlexWaygood","id":66076021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDc2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66076021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexWaygood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-26T14:14:05Z","label":{"name":"topic-type-alias","color":"51FABE"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/1079703017","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11093#issuecomment-1079703017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11093","id":1079703017,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc5AWvXp","user":{"login":"AlexWaygood","id":66076021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MDc2MDIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66076021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexWaygood","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexWaygood/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ale
