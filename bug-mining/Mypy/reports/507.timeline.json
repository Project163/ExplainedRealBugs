#18268. Fixes #9319. Fixes #14279. Fixes #9031. Resolves \"another example\" in #6184 (which is not another example in fact but a different issue - overriding in class matters.\r\n\r\nCurrently `mypy` traverses the MRO of a class in case of multiple inheritance, ignoring the provided type arguments. Ths causes both false positives (see #18268) and false negatives (see e.g. testSubtypingIterableUnpacking2: `class X(Iterator[U], Mapping[T, U])`).\r\n\r\nI propose walking over a similar structure: a \"typed MRO\". It's a regular MRO where every instance is replaced with (one or more) `Instance`s with associated typevars, one per each base having that type in its MRO. Traversing over such allows us to know when the same typevar is substituted in multiple bases. \r\n\r\nThis PR also removes incorrect cross-checks for 2nd, 3rd and so on MRO entries when the first entry contributed same name compatible with all further entries

I don't think, that your checker-based solution works perfectly in all cases (#18270)\r\nI want to propose a new `TypeInfo` field, that should contains a real mapping for all MRO current class type variables\r\n\r\nI think, we can calculate real type for all typevars and propogate it from inheritor to parents recursively:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass A[T1]:\r\n    # mapped_type_vars = {T1: str}\r\n    \r\nclass B[T2]:\r\n    # mapped_type_vars = {T2: T4}\r\n\r\nclass C[T3](B[T3]):\r\n    # mapped_type_vars = {T3: T4}\r\n\r\nclass D[T4](C[T4], A[str]):\r\n    # mapped_type_vars = {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis field can be calculated at MRO build phase and used in checker lately. Also, It may be helpful not for the compatibility-checker only, but for another checks as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, new field shouldn't break already existed checks - we can migrate to its' usage progressively in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you are okay with such decision, we can collaborate and work on the fix together - I don't familiar enough with mypy codebase, but would like to dig into and contribute more in the future. But, seems like I need your help to finalize the current problem solution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18274/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"sterliakov","id":50529348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTI5MzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50529348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov","html_url":"https://github.com/sterliakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-04T22:48:31Z","updated_at":"2025-01-04T22:48:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18415","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18415/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18415/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/18415/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18415","id":2769029281,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGuhRc6GvTRO","number":18415,"title":"Fix
