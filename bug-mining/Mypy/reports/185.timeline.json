pull request:\r\n\r\n- Fixes #10357\r\n- Fixes #9908\r\n\r\nCurrently, checkmember.py attempts handling only type aliases with Instance targets and ignores type aliases with a special form target such as `Union[...]`, `Literal[...]`, or `Callable[...]`, causing either a crash or odd runtime behavior.\r\n\r\nThis diff replaces that logic (the `instance_alias_type` function) with the more general-purpose `alias_type_in_runtime_context` function found in checkexpr.py.\r\n\r\nI'm not actually 100% sure if the latter is a perfect substitute for the former -- the two functions seem to handle Instance type aliases a little differently. But I think this is probably fine: the long-term benefits of consolidating mypy's logic is probably worth some short-term

Report**\r\n\r\nmypy had been crashing on my code for a long time now, because of an error in my code ([same reason as here](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10357#issuecomment-825224225)). I fixed that error, but it now crashes with the following traceback. \r\nSince it has been crashing for a long time, I did not manage to narrow it down to a specific part of my code, or write a minimal example, but I did find out that this crash only happens with the flag `--follow-imports=silent`. it does not crash with any other value for this flag\r\n\r\n\r\n**Traceback**\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \".venv/bin/mypy\", line 8, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(console_entry())\r\n    │        └ <function console_entry at 0x7ffad49cc430>\r\n    └ <module 'sys' (built-in)>\r\n  File \".venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mypy/__main__.py\", line 12, in console_entry\r\n    main(None, sys.stdout, sys.stderr)\r\n    │          │           └ <module 'sys' (built-in)>\r\n    │          └ <module 'sys' (built-in)>\r\n    └ <built-in function main>\r\n  File \"mypy/main.py\", line 96, in main\r\n    res, messages, blockers = run_build(sources, options, fscache, t0, stdout, stderr)\r\n                              └ <built-in function run_build>\r\n  File \"mypy/main.py\", line 173, in run_build\r\n    res = build.build(sources, options, None, flush_errors, fscache, stdout, stderr)\r\n          └ <module 'mypy.build' from '.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mypy/build.cpython-31...\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 154, in build\r\n    result = _build(\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 230, in _build\r\n    graph = dispatch(sources, manager, stdout)\r\n            └ <built-in function dispatch>\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 2729, in dispatch\r\n    process_graph(graph, manager)\r\n    └ <built-in function process_graph>\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 3087, in process_graph\r\n    process_stale_scc(graph, scc, manager)\r\n    └ <built-in function process_stale_scc>\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 3205, in process_stale_scc\r\n    graph[id].write_cache()\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 2313, in write_cache\r\n    new_interface_hash, self.meta = write_cache(\r\n  File \"mypy/build.py\", line 1470, in write_cache\r\n    data = tree.serialize()\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 358, in serialize\r\n    'names': self.names.serialize(self._fullname),\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 3456, in serialize\r\n    data[key] = value.serialize(fullname, key)\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 3393, in serialize\r\n    data['node'] = self.node.serialize()\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 2915, in serialize\r\n    'defn': self.defn.serialize(),\r\n  File \"mypy/nodes.py\", line 1050, in serialize\r\n    'type_vars': [v.serialize() for v in self.type_vars],\r\n  File \"mypy/types.py\", line 535, in serialize\r\n    'upper_bound': self.upper_bound.serialize(),\r\n  File \"mypy/types.py\", line 2528, in serialize\r\n    assert False, f\"Internal error: unresolved placeholder type {self.fullname}\"\r\nAssertionError: Internal error: unresolved placeholder type None\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen using the verbose mode, the last LOG line I get before the error is: \r\n`LOG:  Build finished in 8.065 seconds with 1177 modules, and 0 errors`\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI wasn't able to reproduce using a minimal example.
