(It'll get wrapped by the terminal, if it's longer than that width.)\n\nA wrapped URL will still be recognized as such, if it's otherwise unbroken.\n\nIOW, in an 80-column-wide terminal, this will be parsed as a complete url:\n\n```console\n# 345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890\n$ echo

of these will get cut off at the newline:\n\n```console\n# 345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890\n$ echo

OK.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/3278219275/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ferdnyc","id":538020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODAyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc","html_url":"https://github.com/ferdnyc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19627498320,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAGuhRc7KrJETzwAAAASR49tQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/19627498320","actor":{"login":"sterliakov","id":50529348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTI5MzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50529348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov","html_url":"https://github.com/sterliakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-11T06:06:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19627498355,"node_id":"SE_lADOAGuhRc7KrJETzwAAAASR49tz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/19627498355","actor":{"login":"sterliakov","id":50529348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTI5MzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50529348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov","html_url":"https://github.com/sterliakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sterliakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-11T06:06:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/3278402942","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/19816#issuecomment-3278402942","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19816","id":3278402942,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc7DaHV-","user":{"login":"ferdnyc","id":538020,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzODAyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/538020?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc","html_url":"https://github.com/ferdnyc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferdnyc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-11T06:29:48Z","updated_at":"2025-09-11T06:30:47Z","body":"Looks
