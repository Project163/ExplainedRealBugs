This technique is used in the `numpy` stubs, and causes `mypy` to complain when trying to describe numpy scalars with simple protocols.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nBelow is a MWE [[mypy-playground]](https://mypy-play.net/?mypy=latest&python=3.12&gist=8041e0145f43507bed8c86104a5fb5b2), based on how the [numpy stubs declare the methods on scalars](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/bd1f6067a13f8bbdf99871277426dfaad9f7602d/numpy/__init__.pyi#L3582).
