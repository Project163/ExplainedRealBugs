Report**\r\n\r\nmypy crashes when inheriting from a locally defined namedtuple, when all of the following is true:\r\n- Its fields are not a literal\r\n- Another file generates an `attr-defined` error\r\n- Cache is enabled (without `--no-incremental`)\r\n\r\nSeems to be related to https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10913, but produces a traceback similar to the closed https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/7281.\r\n\r\n**Traceback**\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/.../env/bin/mypy\", line 8, in <module>\r\n

ok\"\r\nmypy --no-incremental mypy_crash/\r\necho\r\n\r\necho \"Third run, with cache enabled, this should crash\"\r\nmypy mypy_crash/\r\n```\r\n\r\nmypy does not crash if any of the following are removed:\r\n- File `b.py`\r\n- Import error in file `b.py`, e.g. by replacing `from a import A` by `from a import crash` (or any other valid name)\r\n- Definition of `class InheritFromTuple` in `a.py`\r\n- Argument `fields` in definition of namedtuple, e.g. by `TupleType = namedtuple(\"TupleType\", 'a b c')`\r\n\r\n**Your Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n- Mypy version used: 0.910\r\n- Mypy command-line flags: (none, see script)\r\n- Mypy configuration options from `mypy.ini` (and other config files): (none, can reproduce without mypy.ini)\r\n- Python version used: 3.7.9\r\n- Operating system and version: Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (bionic)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nYou can freely edit this text, please remove all
