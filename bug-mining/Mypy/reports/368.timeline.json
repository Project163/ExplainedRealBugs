can be an occasional stumbling block that's quite difficult to find a way out of without the right error message.

A also had the `ignore_missing_imports = true` setting to deal with some legacy 3rd-party libraries.\r\n\r\nCode that looks like following fails in this set-up with the error in this issue:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom B import Foo, Bar\r\n\r\ndef do_stuff(value: Foo | Bar) → None:\r\n  match value:\r\n    case Foo(a=a):\r\n      ...\r\n    case Bar(b=b):\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo error is given if library `B` adds the `py.typed` marker.
