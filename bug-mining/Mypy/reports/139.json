For example, when I need to run `check-namedtuple.test`, I need to go to `testcheck.py`, comment all other tests cases and then run it. It is very annoying. Maybe there's a hidden way? If this is the case, then we need to update the docs. https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/11668\r\n- [x] Add duplicate `case` name detection. Right now we can have tests with non-unique names. For example: https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/cee5d3e9a29f43a10a8eeca760976657bf1689c9/test-data/unit/check-newsemanal.test#L2308 and https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/cee5d3e9a29f43a10a8eeca760976657bf1689c9/test-data/unit/check-newsemanal.test#L2317\r\n- [x] Add `3.11-dev` to test suite and allow it to fail, later we can disable failures, but for now it is too unstable: https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/11677\r\n\r\nI will send a couple of PRs with these features if no one has any rejections 🙂 ","closed_by":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11662/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11662/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
