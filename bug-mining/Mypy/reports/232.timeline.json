tried figuring this out but i'm not familiar enough with `mypy` to understand the issue.\r\nthat's what i've found so far:\r\nin the normal definition `c: C = C(...)`, we call `check_callable_call` just once, and therefore we don't convert the paramspec arguments (e.g. ``P`1``) into the actual arguments (e.g. `x: Any`) in `callee.arg_types`.\r\non the other hand, in the parameterized definition `parametrize(...C(...))`, we call `check_callable_call` twice, and on the 2nd iteration it converts the paramspec arguments into actual arguments.\r\nthis is why we get:\r\n```py\r\n(Pdb) p callee.arg_types\r\n[def (*P.args, **P.kwargs) -> Any, P.args`1, P.kwargs`1]\r\n```\r\nduring the normal definition (`c: C = C(...)`), and:\r\n```py\r\n(Pdb) p callee.arg_types\r\n[def (x: Any) -> Any, Any]\r\n```\r\nduring the parameterized definition (`parametrize(...C(...))`).\r\nthen, we get `index out of range` inside `infer_arg_types_in_context`, because we have `formal_to_actual == [[0], [], [1]]`, which is longer than `[def (x: Any) -> Any, Any]`. even though they should be the same length.\r\n\r\nthis is where i got stuck
