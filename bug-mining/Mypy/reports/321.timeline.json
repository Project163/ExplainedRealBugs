#15060 \r\n\r\nThe example in the issue contains another case where an erased type may legitimately appear in a generic function. Namely, when we have a lambda in a generic context, and its body contains a call to a generic _method_. First, since we infer the type of lambda in erased context, some of lambda parameters may get assigned a type containing erased components. Then, when accessing a generic method on such type we may get a callable that is both generic and has erased components, thus causing the crash (actually there are two very similar crashes depending on the details of the generic method).\r\n\r\nProvided that we now have two legitimate cases for erased type appearing in `expand_type()`, and special-casing (enabling) them would be tricky (a lot of functions will need to have `allow_erased_callables`), I propose to simply remove the check.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/15155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9145834273,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5jhXjCzwAAAAIhIlsh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/9145834273","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-02T13:36:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9145834477,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5jhXjCzwAAAAIhIlvt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/9145834477","actor":{"login":"JukkaL","id":1107911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDc5MTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1107911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL","html_url":"https://github.com/JukkaL","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JukkaL/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9f69beaf258b330d7472a12da06ec3074f883c5e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/9f69beaf258b330d7472a12da06ec3074f883c5e","created_at":"2023-05-02T13:36:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
