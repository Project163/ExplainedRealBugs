Describe the Bug\n\nFor this program:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import ReadOnly, TypedDict, NotRequired\n\nclass TD(TypedDict):\n    x: NotRequired[int]\n    \ndef f(td: TD):\n    td.pop(\"x\")\n```\n\nPyrefly (playground as of just now) reports:\n\n```\nERROR 7:12-15: Argument `Literal['x']` is not assignable to parameter `k` with type `Never` in function `typing._TypedDict.pop` [[bad-argument-type](https://pyrefly.org/en/docs/error-kinds/#bad-argument-type)]\n```\n\nOther type checkers allow this, correctly in my view. I just reported bugs to mypy (python/mypy#19130) and pyright (microsoft/pyright#10489) where they fail to reject `.pop` when combined with ReadOnly, so I was curious what pyrefly did. It passes that test case but also rejects `.pop` in all other cases, which is incorrect.\n\n\n### Sandbox
