groups tests so that each group can share indirectly parameterized fixture instances. This optimizes for fewer fixture setup/teardown cycles. Prior to this PR, grouping considered an parameter's index, not the parameter value itself, to determine whether a parameter is \"the same\" and therefore can be shared.\r\n\r\nRelying on indexes is fast, however only works when there's exactly one parameter list for one fixture. If we provide multiple (possibly different) lists for the same fixture, e.g. by decorating test items, one index can no longer refer to \"the same\" parameter. In order to still be able to group for fixture reuse, we have to group by parameter value.\r\n\r\nCaution: The value ends up inside the key of another dict, and therefore must be hashable. This was true for indexes, but no longer is guaranteed for user provided values. A user may e.g. provide `dict`s or numpy arrays. The `SafeHashWrapper` ensures a fallback to `id()` in such a case.\r\n\r\nFixes #8914.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9350/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/comments/998046809","html_url":"https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/11799#issuecomment-998046809","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/11799","id":998046809,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAGuhRc47fPxZ","user":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-20T15:51:03Z","updated_at":"2021-12-20T15:51:03Z","body":"We already have `__hash__: None` on list in typeshed.
