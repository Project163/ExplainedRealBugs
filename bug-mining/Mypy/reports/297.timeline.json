If this pull request fixes an issue, add \"Fixes #NNN\" with the issue number. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #14857. The initial implementation overlooked this statement in [PEP 681](https://peps.python.org/pep-0681/#dataclass-semantics):\r\n\r\n> Similarly, a class that directly specifies a metaclass that is decorated with dataclass_transform is considered neither frozen nor non-frozen.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this is a special case that _only_ applies to classes that directly specify a `dataclass_transform` metaclass. This is import for projects like Pydantic, which requires clients to use a base class but still supports a `frozen` parameter.\r\n\r\nNote that this allows mixed frozen and non-frozen behavior if the base class _does_ have fields:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@dataclass_transform()\r\nclass Meta(type): ...\r\nclass Base(metaclass=Meta, frozen=False):\r\n    base: int = 0\r\nclass Foo(Base, frozen=True):\r\n    foo: int = 0\r\n\r\nfoo = Foo()\r\nfoo.foo = 1 # an error because Foo is frozen\r\nfoo.base = 1 # NOT an error — Base is neither frozen nor non-frozen\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this is probably surprising behavior, it seems to match the text of the PEP as well as the behavior of Pyright.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nChecklist:\r\n- Read the [Contributing
