Fixes #14014\r\n- Partially addresses #19470\r\n\r\nAdded extra logic in `checker.py:conditional_types` function to deal with structural types such as `typing.Callable` or protocols.\r\n\r\n## new tests\r\n\r\n- `testMatchClassPatternCallable`: tests `case Callable() as fn` usage\r\n- `testMatchClassPatternProtocol`: tests `case Proto()` usage, where `Proto` is a Protocol\r\n- `testMatchClassPatternCallbackProtocol`: tests `case Proto()` usage, where `Proto` is a Callback-Protocol\r\n- `testGenericAliasIsinstanceUnreachable`: derived from a mypy-primer failure in mesonbuild. Tests that `isinstance(x, Proto)` can produce unreachable error.\r\n- `testGenericAliasRedundantExprCompoundIfExpr`: derived from a CI failure of `python runtest.py self` of an earlier version of this PR.\r\n\r\n## modified tests\r\n\r\n- `testOverloadOnProtocol` added annotations to overload implementation, which wasn't getting checked. Added missing return. Fixed return type in second branch.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/19471/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20320885993,"node_id":"CE_lADOAGuhRc5VqcYfzwAAAAS7OBzp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/20320885993","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-16T14:39:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20320886070,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAGuhRc5VqcYfzwAAAAS7OB02","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/issues/events/20320886070","actor":{"login":"ilevkivskyi","id":12005495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDA1NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12005495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi","html_url":"https://github.com/ilevkivskyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilevkivskyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9c26271945ee7c9095d769f2138f4f2e969445ce","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python/mypy/commits/9c26271945ee7c9095d769f2138f4f2e969445ce","created_at":"2025-10-16T14:39:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
