 ### Specs2 support in a separate module

+If you were previously using Play's specs2 support, you now need to explicitly add a dependency on that to your project.  Additionally, specs2 now requires `scalaz-stream` which isn't available on maven central or any other repositories that sbt uses by default, so you need to add the `scalaz-stream` repository as a resolver:
 
 ```scala
 libraryDependencies += specs2 % Test
+
+resolvers += "scalaz-bintray" at "http://dl.bintray.com/scalaz/releases"
 ```
