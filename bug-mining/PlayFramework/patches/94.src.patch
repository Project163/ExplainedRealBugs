+Since Play uses a separate pidfile, we have to provide it with a proper path, which is `packageName.value` here.  The name of the pid file must be `play.pid`.  In order to tell the startup script where to place the PID file, put a file `application.ini` inside the `dist/conf` folder and add the following content:
 
 ```bash
--Dpidfile.path=/var/run/${{app_name}}/play.pid
+s"-Dpidfile.path=/var/run/${packageName.value}/play.pid",
 # Add all other startup settings here, too
 ```
