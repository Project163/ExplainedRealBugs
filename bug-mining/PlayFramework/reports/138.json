Confusingly, this section of the same doc: https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.6.x/ConfigFile#Using-with-Akka suggests that akka needs to be configured under `play.akka`, but I believe that hasn't been the case since before play 2.4.  \r\n\r\nAfter browsing the dev startup code ([DevServerStart.scala](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/commit/bad893d6ad7bf6a92ef05ee2fd87297e62f44224#diff-58bf6474fbdd7970aeb1630b24c9f7e2R217)), I found that my attempt at overriding the default setting wasn't working because in dev mode akka configuration is pulled from `play.akka.dev-mode`.  As far as I can tell, this isn't documented anywhere outside of the code.  \r\n\r\nSo to set the max-uri-length such that it would be picked up in dev mode, I actually needed: \r\n```sbt\r\nPlayKeys.devSettings := Seq(\r\n  \"play.akka.dev-mode.akka.http.parsing.max-uri-length\" -> \"1m\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\nIf this is how it's going to be, it would be nice if it could be documented and if issues with the existing docs could be cleaned up to make it clearer.
