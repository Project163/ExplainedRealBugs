This allows e.g. to switch the default schema or something else.\nPlay does support this as well with the `db.default.initSQL` [configuration key](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.2/SettingsJDBC), e.g. with BoneCP.\n\nIt looks like it doesn't support it currently with HikariCP, because there is no mapping for it in the [Play Configuration to HikariCP configuration mapper](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/master/framework/src/play-jdbc/src/main/scala/play/api/db/HikariCPModule.scala#L128).\n###### Sidenode: Split the ConnectionPool from the Configuration mapper?\n\nIt is more difficult to exchange this mapper than it should be, imho. What about letting the `HikariCPConnectionPool` depend on a `Provider<HikariConfig>` instead and bind it to the `HikariCPConfig` class (with minimal changes to fit the `Provider` interface).\nThis would allow to exchange the mapper just exchanging `HikariCPModule` to bind it differently without the need to reimplement the whole `ConnectionPool` class.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cchantep","id":166062,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjA2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166062?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchantep","html_url":"https://github.com/cchantep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchantep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchantep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchantep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchantep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchantep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchantep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchantep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchantep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cchantep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4893/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
