\n\nplayframework 2.4.0 has different behaviour of Json.deepMerge method. This code:\n\n```\nval js1 = Json.parse( \"\"\"{\"property1\":\"x\", \"data\":[\"a\"]}\"\"\")\nval js2 = Json.parse( \"\"\"{\"property1\":\"x\", \"data\":[\"a\"]}\"\"\")\nprintln(js1.as[JsObject].deepMerge(js2.as[JsObject]))\n```\n\nprints in play 2.4.0: \n\n```\n{\"property1\":\"x\",\"data\":[\"a\", \"a\"]} \n```\n\nHowever in play 2.3.x it prints: \n\n```\n{\"property1\":\"x\",\"data\":[\"a\"]}\n```\n\nBecause that some JSON transformation has different result.
