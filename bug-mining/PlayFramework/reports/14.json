However, this zip contains duplicate files, for example both a fully stocked /conf directory at top level, and contained within the project's jar bundled under lib.  In addition to unneccesary bloat, this can cause confusion when wanting to make a quick manual change to a server running in \"production\" mode (which might well be a test server or something else).  The presence of the file at top level makes one assume that editing and restarting the app will make a change, when it may not depending on the class loading order (if it is even on the classpath to begin with).  Issue #3472 was mistakenly reported due to this.\n\nThe raw files should be excluded since this is a production deploy, but if they are going to be there then they should be on the classpath first.\n","closed_by":{"login":"pvlugter","id":59895,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59895?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvlugter","html_url":"https://github.com/pvlugter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvlugter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvlugter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvlugter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvlugter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvlugter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvlugter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvlugter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvlugter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvlugter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/3473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
