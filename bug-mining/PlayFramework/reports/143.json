have been reports that Play's Akka HTTP backend doesn't handle custom methods beyond GET, POST, etc. We should provide support for this. This can be done by hooking into [Akka HTTP's `customMethods` setting](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/blob/174a69491c3f3faf71605b1c9c417e5c2923929c/akka-http-core/src/main/scala/akka/http/scaladsl/settings/ParserSettings.scala#L43) when we [initialise a server](https://github.com/playframework/playframework/blob/e6ed774086368eb7e70fba2b7019494b28dc74b8/framework/src/play-akka-http-server/src/main/scala/play/core/server/AkkaHttpServer.scala#L85-L88). We should support any method that is valid. This will require changes to Akka HTTP's `ParserSettings` so it accepts a function to create `HttpMethod`s, not just a list of known `HttpMethod`s.\r\n\r\nWhile we're at it, we may want to use the `customStatusCodes` setting too. A related setting is `customMediaTypes`; this setting will be handled in #8239.","closed_by":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/8368/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
