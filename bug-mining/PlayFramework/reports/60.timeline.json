E.g. in Play 2.5 we could make all our APIs support both `F.Promise` and `CompletionStage`, to give people a chance to transition their code.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/113950308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"richdougherty","id":14750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty","html_url":"https://github.com/richdougherty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/richdougherty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":337142372,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMzNzE0MjM3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/337142372","actor":{"login":"dotta","id":703748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzc0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta","html_url":"https://github.com/dotta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f9e2d1917019f2bb1b2876b464014640965bade1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotta/playframework/commits/f9e2d1917019f2bb1b2876b464014640965bade1","created_at":"2015-06-22T20:41:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"dotta","id":703748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzc0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta","html_url":"https://github.com/dotta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-22T20:42:01Z","updated_at":"2015-06-22T20:42:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4739","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4739/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4739/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4739/events","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/pull/4739","id":90155110,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzgyNTM1MjU=","number":4739,"title":"Replaced `F.Function` with Java8 friends.

`F.Function` with Java8 friends. Fix #4690\n\nAs explained in d24c79d85eb9f71499588d2180bfb29e6b73d55f, we are embracing Java8\nfunctional interfaces. This commit makes the following changes:\n- `F.Function0` -> `java.util.function.Supplier`\n- `F.Function1` -> `java.util.function.Function`\n- `F.Function2` -> `java.util.function.BiFunction`\n\nThe change is source compatible if the lambda's body passed to either of the\nformer `F.Function` types does not throw a checked exception. Otherwise, users\nwill need to update their code to catch the exception and provide the necessary\nlogic to deal with it.\n\nThere is however an important change affecting source compatibility, as several\nof the methods in `F.Promise` used to throw (Throwable), while they don't now (\nRef #4691).\n\nThere is one additional function type that has no corresponding in the Java8\nlibrary: `F.Function3`. This type is currently only used in the `RoutingDsl`, so\nI initially thought we could remove it. However, it's tricky to remove\nfunctionality, so I decided to leave it alone for the moment, as we can always\nrevisit this in the future.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4739/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":395414608,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5NTQxNDYwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/395414608","actor":{"login":"ClaraAllende","id":876039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NjAzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/876039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ClaraAllende","html_url":"https://github.com/ClaraAllende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ClaraAllende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ClaraAllende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ClaraAllende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ClaraAllende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ClaraAllende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ClaraAllende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ClaraAllende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ClaraAllende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ClaraAllende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6cf451ff765024bae984faff22a1cb86deb0531e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ClaraAllende/playframework/commits/6cf451ff765024bae984faff22a1cb86deb0531e","created_at":"2015-08-28T19:44:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":405531673,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQ0MDU1MzE2NzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/events/405531673","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-10T03:45:28Z","assignee":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/139109117","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/4691#issuecomment-139109117","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4691","id":139109117,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTEwOTExNw==","user":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{

working on this at the moment.  Here's the approach I'm taking:\n- `Promise` extends `CompletionStage`, and wraps a `CompletionStage`.\n- All existing methods on `Promise` are deprecated, with pointers to the `CompletionStage` equivalent.  Methods that take a `Promise`, or a function that returns a `Promise`, have been modified so that they take `CompletionStage`, making all these methods compatible with any API that uses `CompletionStage`.\n- All `CompletionStage` methods have been overridden to return `Promise`.  This makes for a smooth migration path, you can change a `map` to `thenApply`, but still call the result a `Promise`.\n- I have not deprecated `Promise` - the reason behind this is if you deprecate a class, when someone comes to migrate, they'll see the class is deprecated, and change it `CompletionStage`, but then they'll just get compile errors on `map`/`flatMap` etc.  By not deprecating `Promise`, it encourages the smoother migration path of first changing the deprecated `map`/`flatMap` methods, which have documentation on what the `CompletionStage` alternative is, and then later you can switch from `Promise` to `CompletionStage`.\n- For the rest of Play, my approach will be, any method that takes a `Promise` will be changed to take `CompletionStage`, but any method that returns a `Promise` will still return `Promise`.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/139109117/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/139109432","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/4691#issuecomment-139109432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4691","id":139109432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTEwOTQzMg==","user":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-10T03:55:32Z","updated_at":"2015-09-10T03:55:32Z","body":"Also,

methods.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/139109432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jroper","id":105833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper","html_url":"https://github.com/jroper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/comments/139174550","html_url":"https://github.com/playframework/playframework/issues/4691#issuecomment-139174550","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/playframework/playframework/issues/4691","id":139174550,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzOTE3NDU1MA==","user":{"login":"dotta","id":703748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMzc0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/703748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta","html_url":"https://github.com/dotta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dotta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-10T08:58:21Z","updated_at":"2015-09-10T08:58:21Z","body":"Hey James, I recently found out that converting a Scala Future into a Java CompletionStage is tricky. The `scala-java8-compat` library we are using does indeed allow to make the conversion with `FutureConverters.toJava(<scala-future>)`, however the returned `CompletionStage` instance cannot be converted into a `CompletableFuture` (in fact, calling `toCompletableFuture` on the returned `CompletionStage` instance will throw an exception. See the scaladoc here https://github.com/scala/scala-java8-compat/blob/master/src/main/scala/scala/compat/java8/FutureConverters.scala#L42-L55).\n\nI'm pointing this out because we have been using the `FutureConverters` in a number of places, but we haven't really documented that the returned `CompletionStage` cannot be converted into a `CompletableFuture`.\n\nJust wanted to put this on your radar since you are working on something somewhat related. But it may be better to open a ticket, so that we don't forget to at least update the documentation.
